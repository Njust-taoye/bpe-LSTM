hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and um what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear
um-hum
and is
right right is there is there um an- is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask
right
[noise] right
right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like [noise] depending on what you think you'll be doing that day
right
yes [laughter]
yeah yeah well i- i- that's right and it
yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i- in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but [noise]
um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you [noise]
uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you [noise] um
uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i- i'm not i'm not there but [laughter] but anyway
um and seaso- really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if it's hot out but um
that's
that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety m- maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the
the men often have to wear shirt and tie no matter r- right right what time of what time of the year that's right
that's that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those tha- [noise] not reall-
right
oh i see uh-huh
okay and and
and also like the um also the the all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar sim- yeah
yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th- they were much there was much more casual dress although i don't think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing
right
that's that's right
yeah
yeah and
that's right
yeah that's true and um hm [noise] well that's it
yeah [laughter] i don't know what el- what more we can say about that that's
oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh okay all right nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
okay hi
well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice so i usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time slacks i guess [noise] and in the summer just dresses
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often
so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature
so
[noise] not formally
but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like Jerry Junkins' office and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff
and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so [noise] we have to dress a little bit nice we're not [noise]
yes now you know if if every- like in August when everybody's on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or
ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but [laughter] i guess that would have to do with the weather but um
unless it's an ex- you know an unusual day
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah or um-hum what area do you work in
um
okay
[laughter]
it with the
yeah
but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because the air conditioner's doing its job so well [noise]
oh yeah
it
uh-huh just suits and there's not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they can't have a rayon suit [laughter] so
not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway [noise]
uh most of the women wear uh m- actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else
but i'm not in that professional of a position [noise] so i don't i'm not expected to do that
um-hum
[noise] yes pretty much i'm a secretary [noise] yeah
y- yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't know i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine
you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much
[noise] well that pretty much covers the subject [laughter] well thanks for calling me
yep that's all good-bye okay bye
[noise]
okay uh first um i need to know uh h- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
yes yeah
um-hum
yes
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um
she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house sh- then she lived in an apartment and um
that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of
change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she tr- she had she had children all across the United States and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh
not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision
than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family
getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home
and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hard- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
yeah yeah well we we yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with
[noise]
she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her
and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i di- i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating
and um
i i th- i think that what one thing that w- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact
it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very
were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the
what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question
yeah
yeah
yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the United States is changing because
you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
um i- matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation
we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
uh
yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family
you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e- e- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not
any of the grandparents would we feel they're gonna be a good [laughter] they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all
yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people
especially where they've had uh extended family and i and an- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps
you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's
money seems to be too big of an issue wi- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be
you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean [noise] i mean we may not we may not have as [noise] high a standard of living but
the qua- but actually have a truer standard of living
yeah yeah
yeah
[noise]
okay well
i guess that was it [laughter]
[noise]
okay all right hey bye-bye
[noise]
well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know f- and for their uh you know for their own good
i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had t- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh
uh s- eight months ago i guess
and uh we were i was fortunate in that
i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown
so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who
had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh
it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
and it was really not not very good uh
deal we were not really happy with the
nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again
but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it
you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns
um-hum
hm
right
um-hum um-hum
yes
um-hum
right uh-huh
oh i can imagine
um-hum that's tough that's really tough
um-hum
um-hum
yes
my mother excuse me go ahead
um-hum
that's great
that's right i-
um-hum
right yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yep
you were very fortunate
um-hum
um-hum
absolutely un- unfortunately at a lot of times it
responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know
and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh l- [vocalized-noise] i was lucky too that i only have m- one brother
and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done
my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on
that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
that's great
um-hum
sure
um-hum
um-hum that'd be tough
yes absolutely
um-hum
yes
right
um-hum
um-hum
yes yeah we were fort-
oh yes
that's right um-hum
yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas -se people are of course population is getting older you know
um-hum
um-hum -t's right
yes
um-hum um-hum
that's right
sure absolutely and people are families are scattered so much nowadays
yes
yeah yeah just because they're grandparents jus- yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer
um-hum
oh yeah sure realistically it is yes
um-hum
that would certainly help yeah
um-hum
right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway
i think your right
okay was good talking to you yeah take care bye-bye
[noise]
right
me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a
a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such
but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants
from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have
uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air
oh okay
oh [laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
okay
um-hum
hm
hm
now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it
hm
um-hum
um-hum
right
[laughter]
well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and
you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not
uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh
you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um
certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know i- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
it still only in time starts to leak out
yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again
[laughter] jeez [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
hm
um-hum
yeah
oh you were oh okay
yes
yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean w- we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know TI that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen years [laughter]
[laughter] we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before
[laughter]
right right not just overhead [laughter]
you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
um
[noise]
does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines
um-hum
very
yeah it's uh having uh uh w- well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh
[laughter] lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the TACB which is located in Austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at TI
and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um
uh this is air side a- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in tons per year um
and so w- w- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems
uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds uh li- all the acids
uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts
and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto
as you know the they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
the Sherman facility we are still in the
closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the Sherman uh City Council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh
uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project
and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it
uh but it's uh it's something else yeah tha- they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh
because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh
any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend o- o- of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh
uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh
it's an interesting job but um
possibly
hm
uh i'm familiar with that one
we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah
we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it
and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground
but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh
expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would
um
[noise]
i've enjoyed speaking with you
this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building [laughter] yeah
so uh i hope you like your office [laughter]
yeah
yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all w- y'all the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last two years
[laughter]
[laughter] s-
exactly and that's um when you start m- when you start paying your wages you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys
i've enjoy- exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution
yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then there's like you say there's industry
with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere
causing acid rain and everything else
hm
ozone yeah ozo- ozone pollution yeah
well i was i was thinking about that too i mean uh we don't have any suitable replacement for Freon and y- and you have to have it for refrigeration so
but on the other hand you know i i've
um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane
i- it was actually powered by a flame
yeah uh it it something with heat i don't understand the mechanics of it but uh
um-hum
um-hum
oh okay so it still had Freon in it
oh okay i well li-
yeah
yeah
right which happens all the time when they go to service the things
um-hum
yeah escape
sure yeah yeah i
hm well that makes sense
i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and
all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem
but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that [laughter]
we we can't clean it up
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
burning and everything else
yeah
yeah yeah that's right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing it's uh
i- i don't kn- i don't know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know they're chopping those down at a tremendous rate everyday
and i just have a feeling that that you know that's our s- that's our air scrubbing stuff there and they're they're taking away the sponge
i don't know this uh
ozone
yes
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
naw i can believe it
y- you pr- you probably did less harm than what the water would have done though [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
gosh
go- well it's
yeah right the
the action over the rocks and all that kind of stuff
[noise]
jeez well that's scary
i it it worries me to turn on the turn on the taps now because you never know what's gonna come out
you kn- [laughter] and i and i don- i don't really trust these these government agencies that test this stuff i really don't
yeah well it's it's like so many o- it's like chicken you know they go in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken
i don't know if you ever saw that 60 Minutes thing where they showed a chicken processing plant
yeah i i haven't touched chicken since
yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that
and but the government says it's safe uh-huh
right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country
and they s- s- -eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles is s- still so thick you have to cut it with a knife
i don't know
just about yeah
yeah um i don't know you know used to be a lot of states had uh
uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to have that little sticker in the window i know Texas does
and there are about three places in Georgia that does
and i think Louisiana does i'm not sure but i there's not very many of them around anymore
yeah they don't do it anymore
yeah
um-hum
i think that's the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about having to pay that fee a-
yeah a- and i mean all it was was a revenue generator
i- it wasn't serving the purpose that it was designed to serve
i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching huge blue clouds of oil smoke
and you tell me that guy passed a pollution test you know
[noise]
oh yeah oh those are
yeah i mea- you know what was it back in the uh late seventies when diesel engines were the thing
because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look diesel's
what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is o- you know one oh five
i never did like diesels anyway they they were too cantankerous
cold w-
um
yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a Buick had had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing
yeah winter time the the diesel would gel and it wouldn't
i don't know liquefy right and then his injector things got clogged and oh Go-
um-hum
yeah
that that may that yeah that may have been what he had um
but speaking of cars [noise] what more can we do to cars to make them less polluting
yeah
i'm just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars
i saw an article in the pap-
[noise]
well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes uh quite a bit to air pollution
uh y- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh Freon is uh is uh eating away at our
uh what you call that layer there ozone layer
i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro- in place of Freon
[vocalized-noise]
uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works
well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat
be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said
uh you had and uh somehow cr- heat must be created that Freon
oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and
in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes fr- c- uh ice cold
oh yes yes Freon's uh Freon is in a closed circuit
uh that's why our present day refrigerants uh systems are not dangerous unless the lines are broken
w- well did you ever see what happens when they uh replace the or replenish the Freon in your automobile air conditioner
i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere
and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in Texas or what but uh
service stations are going to require to have a special device
to catch this Freon as it is ex- expelled the excess Freon
and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home
no that's true
you know i can remember as a child uh
spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit
no shoes socks shirts or anything
uh i mean from dawn till dusk
and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it never had to worry about uh skin cancer
or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and and get a drink of water without worrying a-
about catching some disease
hm yeah yeah
i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water
uh TI sent me up on a trip to Wyoming i think it was and i was out in this little
town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is going down watching the traffic light change
but uh i checked into a motel
and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't drink the water
it's contaminated
he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately we're out of it right now but as as soon as we get it
i- i'll see that you get a bottle of it
well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it i brushed my teeth with Coca-Cola
[laughter]
oh well th- they had this uh
it's uh some kind of a bacteria call- or carried by animals
and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river
well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream
but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire
pipe system or water system
and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it
i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever did course the oh was a beautiful mountain stream
bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles
yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated
yeah yes
well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you g- you're always hearing stories about well the government okayed this
then all of a sudden you turn around and
my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way it's dangerous
as a matter of fact i did
neither have i
[laughter]
uh yeah
i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst c- city in the country i guess for
air pollution
uh yeah um-hum
well
uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for ten years
no they did away with it because they found out that uh
the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them
and for n- uh for nothing [vocalized-noise] too
yeah
um-hum well now here's another thing diesels
uh diesel engines are uh the worst
and yet they haven't done a thing to them
uh-huh yeah t- t- tell me about it i just got rid of a a diesel engine Escort
well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago
is that right well
uh-huh well now there was at one time
as a matter of fact it may have been Buick i think because i think it was GM that came out with a
disea- uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine
and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the uh
uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over
and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a headache
and they did aw- w- t- we- finally did away with them and went to a straight diesel
well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere
now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in California
i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something
a little more stricter than we do
[noise]
hi Cynthia what did you wear to work today
so can you dress pretty casually
yeah
well i um run a business out of my home
so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever i wanna do with the kids then whenever i have a meeting with a client i'll put a suit on and then
come home and get back into regular clothes again
yeah
i've recently um t- tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot
that's helped me a lot with having i can only have a a limited wardrobe since i'm only working part-time right now um but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that
what about your casual wear do you like to wear jeans most of the time
yeah
it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot
dress shorts
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
not much
yep
um-hum
oh yeah it'll be comfortable
i guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit um we moved from Colorado where and i have a closet full of sweaters that
you live in Virginia now oh that's interesting
uh-huh
yeah
i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so [laughter] needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now
today was uh definitely a shorts day around here
[noise] this is pretty uns- unseasonal but um at least we you know it it it feels good it gets uh everybody doesn't have cabin fever today it's nice to get out and about
okay sounds good was nice talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
um let's see what did i wear to work today um actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes

um-hum
and uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh um you know there's real no no no real dress code where i work um you see people wearing you know all different attire i um don't like to wear heels that really tires me out i work in a big building
so i i- predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that
right
right
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
right right accessories uh-huh
um
yeah mostly i mean at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also
yeah well they're um you know they're like Ber- yeah they're like black corduroy Ber- Bermuda shorts and sometimes i wear a blazer with them and i get really a lot of compliments on them um where i work is predominantly male [noise] so you know
they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans whatever and um but i'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that but seems to work for me [laughter] in fact i just bought or i just got a new outfit as a gift [noise] that um

uh-huh well see i live in Virginia
uh-huh
yeah yeah so i'm you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties but um you know i i- do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses
oh my [laughter] uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here
um-hum
uh-huh
i guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing [laughter] okay okay it was nice talking to you also bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen
but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once
it's near Austin
um-hum
have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks
when i go camping i don't i don't like to rough it i like to have s- a little bit of el- electricity and a little bit of running water
[laughter]
i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing
God
i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico
and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and
doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night
just for fun
no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the bugs
yeah the one g- nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours
yeah
oh
hum
we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore
and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldn't even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you'd get sand in your eyes
yeah it was pretty bad
yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usua- we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time
yeah
yeah and
yeah well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature
yeah
[laughter]
oh gosh it makes it a little
my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home
mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to travel a lot
and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time
um-hum
that is nice
no kidding it really is
um
oh yeah
yeah no kidding
[noise]
okay
nice talking to you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
have you done a lot of camping recently
oh okay
oh yeah
uh where's that [laughter]
oh okay i'm not that much familiar with Texas we've been my family has been everywhere
but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else we've had oh gosh we've
i've camped in a in a in a back of a v- van then we g- then we got a pop-up camper and then we got a trailer now they've got now they've got a big motor home so they they still do a whole lot of camping
oh gosh yes uh [noise] oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years ago and um
oh we di- my family when i was younger we went that was just you know what we did in the summers was go to the from you know national park to national park
we had a lot of fun
yes
me too [laughter]
oh no no [laughter] i've done it but it's not fun [laughter] you don't want to do it for like three weeks at a time that's for sure
ooh no [laughter] no
oh yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] shaking the scorpions out of their shoes [laughter]
oh me neither me neither th- the -squitoes just keep you up all night
yeah
yeah th- that's nice
[vocalized-noise] when my fa- when my family camps we're the the only time you're at the camper is when you want to sleep [laughter] otherwise you're just going constantly you know in all the in all the National Parks and stuff
we camped at the let's see we camped down at at Galveston two or three years ago and that that was that was fun except that they uh were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were
and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but [laughter]
oh how awful
um-hum oh yeah
oh that's miserable
yeah i ha-
yeah
yeah it's i- y- it's y- you always when you when there's kids you've always got to have other stuff to do because it's always gonna rain sometime [laughter] and then your par- par- they drive the parents nuts [laughter]
oh i know i wish i'd app- i wish i'd appreciated it more y- uh when i was when we were camping so extensively y- when w- when we were younger
now i wish i could go back to those places yeah the time and i've got got a child and another one on the way so [laughter] i wish i had time my m- our pop-up camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that's true
plus it's nice to have your own stuff there yeah plus you get eating out is ex- is so expensive and
so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper just
because my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our pop-up with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we don't have to rent a hotel room and that's
that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty [laughter]
yeah well [noise]
what else
[laughter]
well
i think that's just pretty much it we've been on here awhile
well it's been nice talking to you
[laughter]
bye-bye
[noise]
hi Archie i'm Sharon
yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh
i thought the story was pretty good too i th- i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it
no i haven't
um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed
could be i- i haven't been to South Dakota
ha- have you been up to that
oh okay
terrain
really
that's true i agree with that um i- i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just going to be a dud so it it has surprised everybody
uh-huh
right
did you
have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy
y- you have to go see that one and how about Silence of the Lambs go
i do i go every weekend i- i uh those are two definite must see movies i think
[noise]
it's suspenseful i don't think it's very t- i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense
um [noise] the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies
no huh-uh
yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him
yeah
oh
uh-huh
i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d- i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do
he wanted to direct it he wanted to a- to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really w- he really wanted it whether it
whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because
i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
um
yeah who no i don't know who that guy is
oh he does
as a recurring character every week
[noise] oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together
huh-uh
yeah
yeah real scruffy looking [laughter]
yeah
you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um
[noise]
this is Archie
have you seen Dancing with Wolf
have you ever lived in that part of the country
have you ever visited it
i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota
well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh
yeah is is fairly fami- the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's gonna win everything
uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of
well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i- i- i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story
and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah
no i've heard i've heard that's really great though
no you must really keep up
we- isn't isn't Sleeping with the Enemy isn't that a i- is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful
do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohi- is uh you know who he is
he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic -n channel eight in Dallas
and he does uh he has a talk show on the
KLIF anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting there's a certain amount of drivel that they do they've got uh they've got a couple of kids
ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's uh
he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening Sunday night a little bit when i was uh going to
pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh i- the it it's interesting though the the the difficulty with with Dancing with Wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it
uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it
do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver
a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post
he he plays on Murphy Brown
yes he's
he's Eldon her housepainter
do you believe that
that's [laughter] that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it's really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a
you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh
yeah real scruffy looking and it wa- it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie but i thought it's good that you know it was a lot of fun
i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes i should think we've done enough
well i don't know wh- how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up
why don't we do that good-bye Sharon [noise]
[noise]
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um
if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's
one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of
invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh
finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh
um obviously everyday
that's right
uh-huh
right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation [noise]
from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer- phone uh commercial things
oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever [laughter] um
because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are
i think they prey on people's um
inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
yeah
well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic
oh i don't know CIA conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's
things that invade that second type of privacy
where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and
i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia [laughter] yeah to surmise and i'd like to think that's it's quite low at least in this country i don't feel like the KGB is monitoring my phone or anything like that
um-hum yeah
um-hum um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum [noise]
um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then [laughter]
yes yes you'd b- more harmed or something yeah
yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
[laughter] they had you pegged [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but
uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that [laughter] it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering
you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having
virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and
and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home
yeah
yes exactly
um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing
that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and
i realize that that i mean
i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and
things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially [noise]
um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because it's in your way you people walk in and out and
as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
and people would leave me alone
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia- of um public behavior um
people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
and which isn't al- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now th- i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
um-hum um-hum
and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that i mean they o- [laughter] you go to India and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years um but i i just don't quite
um
there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that
there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re- will respect and if that's gone um i i r- really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that
well the class- the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um
which is more intrusive because i have to f- really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see
what i look like what i live like and norm- and they're doing something that normally i really only invite people to because i
any f- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion
[noise]
i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the
typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is th- -t's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a si- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of
uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
commercial soli- solicitations primarily
yeah
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me
um i guess i'm not
typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second
thi- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information
to s- to surmise it is there
[vocalized-noise]
well i guess although
i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it
i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that
[laughter] uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s- there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
bec- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off the- did you hear about this Lotus database that was being put together
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be cou- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate
incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight t- or so a week went up even higher because [laughter] uh someone had had [vocalized-noise]
right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly
right right
right
um-hum
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so s- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is
um-hum
oh that's interesting
but but no concept for wanting to be private
okay
oh th- that would be
that'd be culturally shocking
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private
[laughter]
yes
yes
that's interesting are th- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either g- on a growing frequency
okay
so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol-
Arch how are you doing tonight
oh that yeah fine kind of tired
where am i calling
where are you
Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools
what do you think about it equalization of funding
uh-huh
um-hum [noise]
[noise]
but we're not funding them like other states either though you know it we're not funding our schools like other states either
that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem
[noise] i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a teacher i feel that yes i f- i definitely feel that way all this money that's being paid for administrators
hum-um i can
well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea
that's true
but like in Garland [noise] you can choose the school that you're going to [noise] can you tell this is past bedtime [laughter] um
like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them if it's out of their district you know out of their area i mean
so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area
so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes
yeah what do you do
oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field
well
[laughter] yeah but that's not a bad one
yeah
what do you think about a state income tax
but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not
oh
so what about your income tax
think they're hitting you too hard
no
[noise]
huh-uh
which just keeps accumulating [noise] i don't know [noise] what else do you think about them let's see the state
and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do [laughter] it figures in what is it seven point
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store
because i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out
so it wouldn't be so bad [noise] all right so you think
federal tax is okay
state tax you can see the logic of it but
you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too
we don't need anymore
but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us
[noise]
par-
lots and lots of people before they get it
but still i work in southeast Dallas
and a lot of my children are from poor
you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be
and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars on them and everything and i'm thinking you know this isn't right because my children don't have that
yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat
you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right
[laughter] and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs
that he
yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't think i do
okay well ta- talk to you later then bye
[noise]
[noise]
good and yourself
yeah me too
pardon me
i'm in Lewisville
little bit
that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to have to take away but on the other hand you don't want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to
uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save
uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money
and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that's what we need because we got
you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because we got little kids and we're uh not too pleased about that
pardon me
that's true
yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem
i think we're gonna s-
are you
okay
i think were gonna see a day come
yeah
i think i think we're gonna see a day when s- uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it'll only be to those who are having kids going to school that's probably the most fair way but
you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to the schools because they don't have little kids going to schools
but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we'll see what happens
yeah
yes
um
i don't know that i think has
pluses and minuses because uh those that
are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so where's the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that's
yes
yes
i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it's in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh
that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem
yeah
and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise [laughter] tha- [vocalized-noise] that's the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay enough
i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn't go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for me to do so
i'm a mathematician
pardon me
oh i don't know there are better fields to pick
i mean
yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn't using it hardly at all
so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn't mind getting back into it someday but who knows what'll happen in the future
the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of uh what happens next
but uh ba- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something
i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax
and
most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but
way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem
um
which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a s- state lottery because when you bring
no it didn't
which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite
uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state income tax and now she's gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we'll see what happens i don't know
at any rate uh
that [vocalized-noise]
actually no um
i'm surprised that m- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh we just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out
uh which is a matter of uh
um i'm surprised it's
well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars
for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it's our share to pay in but i'm not paying that much income tax
and you're gonna think well wait now [noise] where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in wh- how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but
it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in debt so deeply
they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt
that's about it i guess
yeah
yeah
seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven
hum-um
how's that
oh yes
that's the way to do it
no
yeah
and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax
uh
yeah i think what we n- what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending
because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh
uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh
uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year
and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers
lots of people yeah yeah
yeah
yeah well i don't have that [laughter] a lot of times if i've got a dollar in my wallet it's like boy where do i g- where did where'd i find that
wow
yeah right
quite a quite a world we live in
oh well
yeah that's all i have to say thank you
um-hum bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh how do you feel about gun control
[laughter] some people do i know
right
yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores [laughter]
[vocalized-noise] i'm from California [vocalized-noise] my mo- the last time i was like purchased a gun my [noise] my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one [noise] and
they he had to fill out some forms but i guess California might be tougher i don't know
[laughter] yeah [noise]
[noise] it's
[laughter]
yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make
like the bumper sticker [laughter] it's true yeah
right
right right
[laughter]
no i yeah i- i- i- i- i agree that it would be like people in
[noise] people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do [noise] come into your house or something
yeah i have have gun g- have have gun management 101 [laughter]
[laughter] yeah or req- re- required for every college student [laughter] oh
God gun control [noise] it's it's such a heated topic in the the and people get so emotional about it
some of them are crazy too [laughter] whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting [laughter]
[laughter] yeah Marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came back
yeah [noise] oh
[laughter]
i'm not sure
i let's see
y- yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay okay okay thanks bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four
i'm not totally i'm not
one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying Uzis either [laughter] you know what i mean [noise] yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think
that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose a- but i think there should be some [vocalized-noise] restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one
yeah
no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think that's kind of scary [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas it's like everybody's a hunter so [laughter] i'm not much of a hunter but
i've never even bought a gun myself my dad's given it to me or someone's given me one so i'm probably real illegal you know carrying guns that aren't even mine [laughter]
it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so
and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together
right
that's true
i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them
right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign up here [laughter] something like that
right exactly [laughter] before graduation
yep
oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they don't see any sense in it at all
they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that
don't use it for that [laughter] well yeah that's true [laughter] they shoot each other thinking they're a deer [laughter] yeah darn i thought you were a deer Bob sorry my mistake [laughter]
looked like antlers i don't know [noise]
[laughter]
yep that happens a lot too
but i guess that's it
that's my opinion on it [laughter] so what now
uh
uh i think we just hang up yeah okay [laughter] thanks bye [laughter] [noise]
[noise]
have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either
offering a service or
they're introducing some new product in the area and
normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
or you hear somebody already starting r- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
even had some of them the
they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
what i would love to see done to stop all of this
we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them
that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their s- salesman to come out
now i agree with their right to um
pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have g- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get
wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
but i consider invasion of my privacy
a harassment in itself
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
i'm drawing the blank
uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
and take it easy now good night
[noise]
[noise]
yes yes
that is that one that you were talking about
uh-huh uh-huh
[laughter]
um-hum
that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too
uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i- i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand
so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy
i agree with you on that particular subject there
let me see
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations
uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
[noise] and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
[noise] and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me
um-hum
right
yeah yeah no i- i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either
and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
[laughter] yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something
but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like th- they see that word and it says uh go
[laughter] instead of stop
oh goodness
[laughter]
oh gosh
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true
hm well what else
i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think
you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else
and i can't remember what it was
and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door
[laughter]
oh goodness okay is our five minutes up [noise]
pretty cl-
well it was nice talking to you too Jim
okay thanks bye
[noise]
we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first time homeowners who've only been living here about six months
oh boy
uh-huh
oh so y- you're an old pro then
um-hum
well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that it was expensive
um-hum
oh really
hm
well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband w- went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that that's what brought us here and um we had um
heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range
um-hum
[laughter]
yes
um-hum
really
hm
yes
well that makes sense
um-hum
hm
oh that's good
[laughter]
well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here
hm
uh-huh
[laughter]
um-hum
yes
so [noise] did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it was broken or
oh
oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time homeowners i'm still scared about everything like that [laughter] going wrong and how do you know it's going to happen and all
um-hum
we really like our school out here
but we um
we were scared to buy a an house
in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn't know um you know if we were afraid we'd be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something
um-hum
hm
um-hum
well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three
house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years
it's slab
um-hum
um-hum
well that's good
yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so
well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got a really good reputation and
[laughter]
fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you g- good luck with this program then bye-bye
[noise]
okay
oh
okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years
and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson
[noise]
we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh
[noise]
well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the uh the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same pricewise i would think
yeah so
yeah
yeah well um
[noise] i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i've it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a house so
[laughter] so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our pri- that the the value of our house went up you know considerably o- over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period
but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so
but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so
uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days
and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it's uh in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District
and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she w- you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so
so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now
well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice
because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that
but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape
and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is
and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house
and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so
no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right
yeah uh but uh
yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise
yeah so
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the b- you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation
and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete
and makes it more uh s- more stable and and puts more strength into it
so uh you know it it
[noise]
uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so
yeah so
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam
[noise]
yeah so that's and that's what ours is our h- the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house
and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so
yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder
[noise]
yeah
okay
[laughter]
yeah so well it uh you know i think it's a a good place to live uh or course if i didn't think that well we wouldn't still be living here so
right yeah that would
okay thank you uh
okay thank you you too
[noise]
hello this is Lois
and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions
yeah this is about changes in women in the
uh there's really a lot isn't there i mean there really is
oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh
okay
[noise]
all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations
um no i think n- now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know
oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is
oh i can't either not a one
um-hum
yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved
yes yes
oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it
yes yeah yes
um yeah
yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know and that way they can't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah
yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have
and if you get it you know then
um-hum
oh yeah uh-huh as a matter of fact that's what i'm doing um-hum it sure is it sure is
um-hum
oh
uh-huh
yeah yes that is
um-hum
yeah
oh
oh i do i really do i think it's great
uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the next week you know i'll work three and she'll work two we just share off like that
um-hum yeah we get the full benefits but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under yeah
yes
it really is and that way we're not really missing anything out you know of those children uh-huh
um-hum yes oh it is
it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss any of those PTA's and you know all of that so so
um-hum
yeah
yes i think it's great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation
um-hum
um-hum
yes oh i do too yes
but yeah yeah because most time now you know it's just a weekend or just forget it ye-
uh-huh
oh yeah
to do yeah
um-hum yeah i think we've really come a long ways in that because yes
um-hum
yeah but i can remem- remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off
oh yes
um-hum
where oh yeah yes
oh i do too
yes yes yes
um-hum they really are
[laughter] i- know i know the feeling well it wa- okay and i sure will and bye-bye
[noise]
hello
hi
hi this is Lisa
um-hum
yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
-t's kind of an easy thing to talk about
yeah
um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it
okay yes
yes i know because
i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all
uh-huh
yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better
um-hum
because women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in
i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing
yeah
hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal
uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh
[laughter]
yeah
exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it
um-hum
and then
um-hum
also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
is it
that would be great
or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house
and sh- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office
so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing
do you
do you work like half days or half weeks or
hm
oh is oh that's great
uh-huh do you get the full benefits
oh that's wonderful
yeah especially with children and so many things going on that would be great
either way yeah [noise] you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially if you have young children
um-hum
oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
yeah
[noise] i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful
plus i bet it cuts [vocalized-noise] cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick
um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening
so that's real helpful so you don't [vocalized-noise] you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand
so
uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just it's always been that way but i know
oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor- women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but
mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward
yeah i think it's getting better not worse
well i should probably get back to my job [laughter]
[noise] call again
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh do you have a pet Randy
a poodle miniature or uh full size
i read somewhere that the poodle is one of the the most intelligent dogs uh a- around
oh uh-huh so you you've only known the dog wh- how long did you say th-
oh well uh is it uh uh how old is the dog
oh it's still just a pup
yeah i have a uh
well a mutt myself i call it a uh a chowpherd
it's uh part Chow and part Shepherd and it as i understand it uh both sides of the were thoroughbreds so she's a genuine chowpherd
she has the the color and the black t- tongue of a Chow
but uh she has the cha- the shape of a uh uh Shepherd
oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds so she's a medium size
but she's big enough to be intimidating it is a fi- a fixed female by the way
and right from day one she was teaching me
[laughter]
she is she's the most intelligent dog i've ever seen
course i'm
little prejudice of course
[noise]
no the first time i brought her home she was only uh was it six weeks old
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area
but uh next morning she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom
so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there
but it wasn't too long till she uh found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning
and since then uh i've i live alone
and uh i live in a motor home by the way i'm uh an RV full time RVer
and it's it's such a pleasure to come home at night and sh- you can see her smiling from ear to ear she's so happy to see me
and uh i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not
uh-huh
[laughter]
well my dog's an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors
uh she'd rather sl- sleep outside on the the cold ground at night
but uh i do make her come in
and i feed her indoors that's to lure her in but during the day i have her on a uh on a leash
which is uh on sort of a run i have a a thirty foot cable
running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a uh twelve foot leash so she can cover quite an area
and uh she's the best uh
burglar alarm going
oh yeah she uh it's the strangest thing though uh children
no matter how strange they are or how new they might be can uh walk right up to her
but adults if they're strange to her or or they look suspicious or something boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off
and i have not discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults
but sh- uh she is a great comfort to me
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
what you mean she didn't appreciate all that attention
uh-huh what's her name by the way
what uh what do you call the dog
Mitzi yeah mine is Gin
as in uh martini
[laughter]
actually it's Gin Two
because uh when i was a teenager in high school i had Gin One
but then when i went out in the world i
couldn't take her with me
uh-huh
oh yeah
ah what a shame
um-hum
oh well
well Randy we've just about used up our time here and i must say it was interesting i enjoyed talking about pets with you
maybe we'll get together again in the future
take care now bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh yeah currently we have a poodle
yeah
uh it's a miniature
yeah
well um i wouldn't uh i definitely wouldn't dispute that i- it's it's actually my wife's dog uh i i became part owner six months ago when we got married but uh
it uh definitely responds to uh to authority and i've had dogs in the past and uh
it seems it seems to uh respond real well i- it she- she's picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh teaching by force i guess is what i'd like to say [laughter]
well about a year i guess
it just turned two i believe
pretty much yeah yeah
okay
oh that sounds interesting
oh that's that's neat how uh about how big then
okay
yeah yeah
most definitely
yeah
oh i wouldn't doubt it yeah
well that's understandable yeah that's uh
uh-huh
okay
oh
yeah
okay
i see
[laughter]
yeah definitely
yeah i can honestly say we do um we uh just recently put a security system in our house and so now uh in order to uh
to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh uh locked up in the the master bedroom during the day and then she's got the the bedroom and the bathroom to for free run during the day but
we've always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door she's definitely ready to get out and r- run around
really
oh wow
yeah
okay
okay
okay
most definitely
yeah yeah the yeah that's a that's a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that
um-hum
wow that's uh
yeah that's interesting
yeah i kn- i know our dog has had uh had some different reactions she's never really been around children and uh
if if the child is is pretty straight forward um she's fine i- if a child is a little intimidated she'll jump around and and yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared
uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion w- with uh with younger kids
but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota
and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about
three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma and the dog kind kind of felt out of place then because she was she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didn't know how to handle herself so
she really did she just uh she she was alm- she was just inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then she'd go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh
it was it was just su- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh
uh pardon
oh it's uh Mitzi
yeah
oh okay
yeah
i see
yeah yeah
yeah i had uh i had a similar uh experience i i grew up on a farm so i always had uh outdoor pets
and uh the dog i had when i moved to Dallas about five years ago was a uh Springer Spaniel black Lab cross
and he was a real a real lovable type but uh definitely not an apartment type animal so he uh he had to stay home
yeah yeah it really was it he uh apparently had a tough time with it for a little while then he he got he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but uh
yeah
okay
most definitely
well that's great
that sounds real good
you too bye
[noise]
hi
well i mostly listen to popular music i uh
listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and
uh quite honestly i i have some little children and i've unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice how about you
[laughter]
[laughter]
lucky you [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days
um-hum
um-hum
right
when it was really just starting yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
right
yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm
and uh sounds th- sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and
uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces
that's right
no
yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the MC Hammer who's really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um
Wild Thing do you remember that that song he used i can't remember who the artist was on that
who
was it well
may- maybe it wasn't that one then because it's a living it was a living person that i'm that i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey
that's those are my words [laughter] and uh i guess that they're they because he hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and
paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but [laughter]
maybe so i
i can't think
yeah
well right they destroyed it [laughter]
oh yeah
i i remember seeing the video of it on MTV and i thought it was hideous it was oh i didn't like that either
i remember i saw him in a concert when i was
i was in high school
um-hum he was very goo- i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um Philadelphia it was in JFK Stadium it was i don't remember
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
[laughter] hm no [laughter] oh
you can only laugh [laughter]
right [laughter]
[laughter]
well they i guess w- ou- our age is showing when we [laughter] when we think that
um-hum
yeah
like Paul Sim- [vocalized-noise] yeah
yeah
what do you mean by world music
um-hum
uh-huh
huh
right
no
so then it becomes a kind of music o- of it's own so to speak or hm
uh-huh
right
uh-huh uh-huh [laughter]
they are they trying to stop [vocalized-noise] [laughter] putting in a little interfer- [laughter] okay we've talked our five minutes though [laughter]
oh i've been listening to that a lot lately
go together y-
[noise]
hi um
okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like
yeah
[laughter]
oh really
well um
[laughter] i don't have that i don't have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the st- stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car um
uh however i d- i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i- i think i like uh
i
i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh th- there's such a wide selection i think i like a lot
or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i i-
i i like music that is that that i feel if it's performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if it's not then i won't [laughter] i i really don't
rap
yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i d- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is i-
when it becomes militant or if it's uh violence oriented i i'm i- i r- i have i have strong objections to that um
actually i listened to one time i -member it's this is back when r- even
uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
yeah right when it was just starting i heard
what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of mus- the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap
and um you you listen a lot if you l- if you l- hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it y-
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really
give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that's really due to them
yeah
yeah um-hum
yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote
okay
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i th- i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cov- i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of
like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old
i mean i i it it a l- there're a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that
that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and i'm like you know i i don't wanna listen to this [laughter] because you know you think of the original it's like you know oh that was really great that was a you know
really good piece of work and then y- when you hear the cover it's like you know God you know what what are they doing to this [laughter] oh i th- i think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song
y- and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolu- it was pitiful [laughter]
yeah there's [laughter] yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything
yeah yeah i i think i think that prob- yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
yeah
[laughter] oh man
[laughter] yeah i've i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was
i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and
the uh the Beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they're better than the Beatles and i'm like you know you you don't know what you're talking about
[laughter] oh i mean you know c- the comparison made between New Kids on the Block with The Beatles i mean it was just
[laughter] yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you [laughter] know at this point but
yeah but we- well you know i mean i i've i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the
in the mid and early eighties and then
um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music
which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really that's not world music but w- what Paul Simon's doing i think is is is is great because he's
uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know u- drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um
well world music is um a lot of the a lot of
where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music
a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for
let's say another audience let's say a North American and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music
because i mean there are some i mean i l- there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know i- and it's the same way with w- you know world music takes
the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know
the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking
yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um
uh i think that they don't use elec- el- some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now
and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good ex- another good example was i heard Miles Davis
and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it [laughter] i mean you know he's this jazz performer and then he's playing with Ravi Shankar who's a very good
he's a very good arranger uh [vocalized-noise] arrangement to [vocalized-noise]
but uh were going to get off [vocalized-noise] [laughter] i don't know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it's just incredible
yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never th- would think that they that they can actually play together but
[noise]
okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a
computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on
whatever we've got coming in check coming in and how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also sp-
and because our house payment is once a month that's our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it's really still there
so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do y'all do
um-hum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well
um-hum and and you're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good
yeah i foun-
um-hum
yeah
you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that
yeah
that's a good choice we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year we've budgeted
the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with TI and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh
we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear
yeah
that's good to be in that kind of shape what are y'all trying to do long term
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah mostly what we're doing we've worked [noise] we've done the uh CODA account with TI where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they [noise] match it
[noise] and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for TI and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an IRA and we had an out
we had an existing IRA so we have both of us have some money in an IRA that we're also trying to figure to
put it we're putting it in CDs right now and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a [noise] mutual fund
[noise] um-hum
yeah [noise] the other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um
[noise] Han- oh [noise] John Hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary [noise] and uh what we were pla- what
what what our uh goals were on a long [noise] term budget in terms of retirement kid's college paying off the house buying a different house
um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at
and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that
that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me
that's a a big thing to think about
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
okay
[noise]
i guess that's most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything you'd like to add
-kay well it's been nice talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
a running total
yeah
uh we've we've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much
we have coming in each month and then uh we've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we sat d- made up different accounts like
you know we've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and
entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close we've you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so
um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so
uh-huh
yeah yeah i stay w- i have to stay within it so i
you know and then we have that you know if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and some- un- unexpected comes up then you're not
[noise]
you know you don't feel it so strapped
right yeah because we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month
uh-huh you got paper under your table
uh-huh
uh-huh
to be out of debt
free
yeah the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment and that's the only thing we ever we try to stay out of debt so
uh-huh oh as long term [noise] we just he h- you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that that's all we've and you know we just have our life insurance for right now
so [noise] we don't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now so
yeah that's what we're doing [noise] so
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a CD for a while and then uh
you know [noise] and then when we if we need it we wait till it it's expired and then so
uh-huh
uh-huh
or not yeah
uh-huh that sounds interesting we've never done any- we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and he's set up uh [noise] you know determined how much we need to
you know we need if something were to happen
you know
yeah
right yeah y- you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in Texas i would uh
sell the house and move back home you know to my home town and and uh i wouldn't stay here in Texas so
you know i don't know what he would do [noise] but
yeah mine too
nope that's about all for mine
nice talking to you too bye-bye
[noise]
all right
uh we've got a lot of them [laughter] too many of them
yeah well my husband's real good at using them
i don't have any of them i don't carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him
yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas
and uh that's got us in trouble
[laughter] yeah
the ATM machines
those things there that's what gets us
well no he doesn't have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records
but uh he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card [laughter] you know i've used the credit card a couple times to pay bills
yeah
yeah that's what he's talking about doing now
yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me [laughter]
yeah
i don't know i like that he walks in you know and he's got this little gift and how'd you pay for it credit [laughter] he you know said whipped out my little card
yeah i'd never thought about that way i don't really look [laughter] i guess i ought to sometimes
well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo
yeah
like credit cards [laughter] oh no never thought of it that way either he's you know he's addicted to it at times
and see the thing is you know he go out and he'll spend it when he wants you know and uh uh i'm afraid to i'm afraid to use that credit card
yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and
he's not a yeller though but
he calmly you know you shouldn't have spent it all on that
he likes to buy the kids toys [noise] with the uh credit card too y- you know he'll go to by Wal-Mart or something and
yeah well uh
i don't know the uh
uh the my Wal-Mart that's where all of our bills are for the credit card
but we went in for uh
uh something for the car one day the last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the
a pair of shoes for me and uh let's see what else did he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh
[laughter] you know we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at Wal-Mart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids [laughter]
yeah i'll second that
yeah
i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us
i don't think we'd live
yeah well i've been asking my husband for the credit cards i've got all of them but one
i just hide them from him and when i feel that it's necessary to pull it out i'll pull it out but he keeps one of them
he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh
credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount
yeah you know uh i don't really exactly remember how much it is i think it's about five hundred limit uh you know it's just uh just one for him to fiddle with
i have to think of something else i'm i'm blank
well six minutes i've got a timer on my uh
clock on my phone
well we bought this with credit too [laughter] well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh
popped that credit card out it was a Sears [laughter]
no i used to be i'm in Texas
well i
i don't know i don't know how far it goes
are you in Texas
oh i'm in uh down here in Sherman or Denison rather
first phone call this is my first one too
huh
you know we got to get back to credit cards [laughter]
it [vocalized-noise]
i know i couldn't uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh
cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out
and uh
that's got us in a little bit of trouble now that's why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there
uh uh my hubby does not have uh
too much control when it comes to using that card uh [laughter] i know uh
uh for quite a while we was using them to uh
uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent
you know it uh
when we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day
and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was [noise] paying
the rent plu- try- plus trying to get the money for an- ca- another car and
it got it got real rough
he just popped out that uh Master Card and
yeah we got a big cash advance and really that's what's uh holding us back now that's
yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk
that's what i'm looking for now that's why i was just trying talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing
okay
oh yes [laughter] and i believe we all do and and it's just too easy to use
[laughter] oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much
[laughter]
um it uh [vocalized-noise] you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i'd rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash
uh yes
yes that's uh real easy to do i have to watch it
in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament
um
they they've um you know they've they've made them too easy to and too accessible at everything to to buy
oh yes
and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down
oh uh-huh
oh that's good
[laughter]
oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle
as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan
oh no
um yeah the ATM's they're but they're nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed
oh that's the best way it's used [laughter] that's the best way yes now i think that sort of
evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something
[laughter]
[laughter]
and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it
[laughter]
oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah
oh
those are fun
you get started on them and can't quit
[laughter] just exactly
[laughter]
oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping s- frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything
yeah i- there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if
[laughter]
yeah they
oh yeah that's it
oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just
you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you don't care how much it costs or what it takes
uh-huh
yeah that's uh i always end up going into Wal-Mart and [vocalized-noise] coming out with everything that uh i didn't have on the list
we're just getting more than what we went in for [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah it's dangerous
um-hum oh yeah it's just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we're we're infamous about that
and so
[laughter]
oh well yeah i well i'm i'm glad we have credit cards that's uh
because in sometimes when there's an emergency it it comes in handy
it's nice to have
yeah
we've yeah we've had uh
[vocalized-noise] a sick animal and uh
the vet you know the dog and vet's are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldn't do without them
huh-uh no no i think it's become too much of an everyday life here they're part of it
[laughter]
[laughter]
the balance
oh yes uh-huh
so you know he can't spend too much
yes um-hum
i was i was just uh
oh well let's see i guess we've talked what almost five minutes
oh
oh i wish i had one of those
oh see there you go
oh your up in Memphis
oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far
yeah yeah i'm down in Houston
oh okay yeah um-hum
well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had
uh-huh
my husband did one last night and he just loved it
he's been getting he got a real good topic
so well uh
yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think we've pretty much said it all
um but
so uh but yeah uh i think we couldn't make it without them
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah yeah
but uh we uh we try to keep a uh
tight controls over uh over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays
[laughter]
oh goodness
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
it gets rough
that's hard
get that cash advance uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do they're worth it
oh well i- i think we've pretty much come to an end here
i think it was at least five minutes wasn't it
[laughter]
okay
[laughter]
uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading
oh
right i've read that one too i [vocalized-noise] only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i- i really enjoyed you know all the little
things that you find out about Texas
uh-huh
uh-huh
well um i have an interest in art so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment
[noise] and um
oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type
books
um right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and it's history that's fairly interesting
yeah i- i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled self-improvement how about you
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh [noise]
right
yeah
yeah yeah well i g- maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self-improvement
i mean they are but i don't label it as such
well i don't know um
i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would
be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know g- getting your yourself in gear to
uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do [vocalized-noise] convincing you that you need to get on with it
[noise] yes
sure
um
[laughter]
yeah yeah
[laughter] i don't know i i'm not sure i could take too much of Stephen King that's a li- little little heavy for me
yeah
well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work
oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but
yeah yeah
yeah
okay well any other comments
[laughter]
well we just started right [laughter]
well you too and uh [noise]
good-bye
[laughter] good-bye
[noise]
wonderful touch tone telephone there
uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um
[noise] i get a charge out of uh Texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh
about the different areas of of the k- of the state by reading it
oh yeah it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things it's pretty pretty neat
um oh i like photography um [noise] magazines i don't take a subscription or anything like that um
things oh
being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and
and uh kind of strange because i'll [vocalized-noise] it's not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh [noise] how about yourself
um-hum
[noise] oh that's great
um-hum
i bet that would be rather interesting uh
that's uh self-improvement that's that's alw- well that's that's kind of a hobby but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um
[noise] um [noise]
well i hate to yes i do
[laughter]
we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was
[noise] At America's Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments
um one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
[noise] uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um
every now and then i'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh
better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type
actually which all you know betters yourself
um-hum
[laughter] like what for example
um-hum
sure
sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um
our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know
by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people
and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers [laughter]
so it's it's ver- it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it's really uh excellent fast reading and uh
but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say -kay read these ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them
he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting [laughter]
yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and course they're always a little spookier than the movies but uh
it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books
um-hum
in quality -pecially nowadays uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of th-
exactly exactly right
[noise] yeah w- we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what wh- what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh
that's kind of part of it
uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two [laughter]
ah this is true i've enjoyed it
ha-
have a good day bye-bye
[noise]
all right Amy how are you doing today
oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that
um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back
[noise]
hangings on weekends
in public places there is one state that does that by the way
i want to say Oklahoma i saw re- something the other night about it
they don't do them real often [vocalized-noise] which is obviously the death penalty
um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs
and sixty doll- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just quit screwing up the system uh
that's pathetic
that's pathetic i-
this is true a- a- a- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to
life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system
exactly
a life for a life
the old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really
[vocalized-noise]
just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge [noise]
[noise] the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene
uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off
uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
there's a per- certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
the guy's guilty
exactly
exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial whi- is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
i think that that if it's an if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program
uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
hm
yeah ye- i get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know
exactly
yeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense
you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer
this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation
oh so you're at the house you're not at the plant
oh hold it
oh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure
oh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye
fine fine
yeah
okay you go ahead
um-hum
in public places
yeah
really what is that
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or [noise]
you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
you know it's crazy
yeah
well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for s- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like you know one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on
yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um
yeah
um-hum
right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a f- you know a fortune to keep doing that
and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
right
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
and have some judge that was paid off or you know had goo- a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but [noise] seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it
you know
[laughter]
he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah
yeah
yeah
oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically
yeah yeah
well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with two little ki- preschoolers [noise] my husband works for TI
so yeah
oh yeah i've got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room [laughter] okay thanks a lot bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter] w-
well i'm kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i'm doing that and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry
you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting
where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff
um-hum
um-hum
that's right that's right
a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through
two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned
and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty
um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no
and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he sh- he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there
and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts
he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it [laughter]
[laughter] yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
hum
um
hum
yeah
hum
well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
i know i didn't know that EDS has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh
definitely i had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out
for men it's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and win- wing tipped shoes oh it is definitely lined out
women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits
and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is
spelled out when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said
these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and [noise] hair just this way yeah
and EDS is very particular about this hair cuts i mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed
[laughter]
well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because
we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse
you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're gonna have to un- unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid
and she
and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her
[laughter]
um-hum
some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more yuppyish and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just you
[laughter] you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we
we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers
like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual
yeah
[laughter] it's it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here [laughter]
yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i've done i've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different
yeah okay bye [noise]
okay um i don't know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next [laughter]
it's pretty bad but it's true [laughter] you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know
we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next [laughter]
yeah
y- yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and
and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know y- you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not
you know i i've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it's just so it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so
uh
uh-huh
oh no [laughter]
uh-huh
oh no [noise]
oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry [laughter] but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts
and i don't care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want
but these were shorts is all they were i mean i- i don't care what else you call them you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these weren't even really
full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because these weren't even those these were like
pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice
but you don't wear shorts to work you know i mean [laughter] as far as i'm concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them it's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an
cut off you know that yeah no this is where we're going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know
so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but
yeah
uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know
i mean i've never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts i don't care what you say they're shorts you know well i think TI's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i
oh do they really
oh my God
i coul- i couldn't afford to work there [laughter]
oh no
uh-huh
TI says no shorts and no halters you know that's it [laughter]
wow
i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i
i see i- i am more i don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts but i am more productive when i'm in pants
i- i am i work faster i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels you know i it and it's weird but i it's i do i i can i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable you know
right [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
you can't do that in a skirt [laughter] poor thing
oh yuck
yeah that's terrible that's terrible gosh
well i don't know i just figure
you know yeah sometimes i worry about
you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but i'll go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not
cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if
you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know i don't know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know
really wow [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah [noise]
[noise] isn't that funny [laughter]
that's great
[laughter]
yeah
that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit
it's gonna make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know [laughter] or it would me you know
yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uh-huh [laughter] i can see it now [laughter] well it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable
it really is
oh yuck yeah well it's kind of enjoyable i'm really looking forward to it [laughter] well thanks a lot bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
um how's it been this week for you
weatherwise
hum-um
oh no dam-
uh-huh
my goodness well i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then
[laughter] it was ninety six yesterday
[laughter]
yeah we set a record yesterday and uh v- very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so
very cool [noise] uh i think right now it's like sixty nine
and that's cool for [laughter]
or if i- it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant no rain in the last month i don't think ground's very dry and
our yard work e- everything is in bloom so our yard work's pretty tough uh ground being dry but
i guess it also uh brings about allergies we're having a lot of allergies down here right now
everything blooming and and the weather and uh think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever
too so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh golf reasons and things like that
yeah
[laughter]
yes
hm
hm
hm
yeah
um-hum
no snow
hm
hm
hm
um-hum
[laughter]
yes yes it is down in uh more southern an- an- western areas and of course we're um about two hours from the northern border straight south and
and uh very windy it's amazing to me because i've only lived in Dallas three years and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time
it does i- i- i very seldom if any i can't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing
[laughter]
hm
uh-huh
um-hum
oh reall- where did you go to school in Indiana
Purdue i have a brother that lives in uh uh Southbend Indiana
and i had to always w- i've lived there for eight years myself i'd always said i was gonna go back to school and go to Notre Dame
but i didn't uh
no originally i'm from New Mexico i was born in New Mexico and we lived in uh Southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually
and uh
[laughter] very much very much because i- i spent thirteen years there
and uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago so
yeah
it's uh uh uh uh my father was in the Air Force so
uh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
right
yeah
it's um it's just as long as you want to i mean it's just a [noise]
as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for Texas Instruments uh
oh okay
um-hum
oh r-
yeah
oh actu- i- i work for Texas Instruments and um
i'm in a i'm an environmental engineer
and uh [noise] they just published this internally
[noise] you know getting people involved so th- that's really strange i i was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though i was thinking God do we have a TI in Maryland or [laughter]
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
[noise] um-hum
[noise]
oh well
yeah yeah well really it uh
[noise] the the letter just says um
[noise]
[noise] let's see i can't i was looking at it i was trying to find out
[noise] speedy short cuts and all it says not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it
[noise] when needed so
okay
um-hum
uh well it's actually um waste water taking taking care of uh i'm actually in the air division and we monitor um
[noise] anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building or
um
we do have customers that um
their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that but i- within
our department we uh take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air
[noise]
oh uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
oh uh-huh
oh uh-huh
um-hum
yes
uh-huh yeah we actually our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the Dallas area course we have several plants here but um we do air modeling also
and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area what we do we have a weather station
that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction and and uh we have a huge chemical data base
and uh our our chemical data base [noise] so that we know every chemical on site and and um it's concentration and and if if anything ever happened God forbid
you know a building explosion or something like we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
weatherwise or otherwise weatherwise
damp
cold
warm
[laughter]
we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week
we have had highs of seventy two
lows in the twenties
[laughter]
i heard about th-
hm
um-hum
[laughter]
the blue flu yeah
yeah the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess
oh we have had uh as i've said we've had variable weather uh
it has been
untypically wet for this time of year
and also we have a lot of
green you know the grass has been growing and
if you look outside you
would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and
buy a new spark plug or something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh
do not have to
go out and buy the spark plug no but we've had an unusually uh uh warm
spring and well i guess we're still in winter and uh
we have had no snow
to speak of to speak of
we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and
this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation
so it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year
so uh in that regard it's it's fine but uh
i envy you you're at ninety four degrees i thought i heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday
yeah
[laughter]
um-hum well i spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana
in the flatlands and it was that way everyday
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than
fifteen or twenty miles an hour
summer a- and winter so
that uh we you you became accustomed to it i guess but uh otherwise
w- as i said we have had a uh relatively mild
winter f- speaking for this area of the country
Purdue
oh yes
[laughter]
well you are not from that area originally i can tell
oh okay
[laughter] well
um-hum well i thought i heard a little Tennessee in [noise] the-
um-hum
gee you've moved almost moved around as much as i have
[laughter]
oh i see well i worked for the government so i i moved uh
much more frequently than i had intended uh for sixteen years but
i guess the uh th- this is my first conversation in this uh uh
series
i h- i received a call last night because of the uh
i had not received my uh personal identification number
so i had to call Jack Godfrey today and ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i couldn't get on the line
so uh is there any i'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk
oh okay
no i do not i work for GTE
and i uh
of course was i was sent a uh
an application from uh from Jack i've known Jack for sometime i'm in the
speech processing business and have been for a number of years so i was very much interested
in in being a speaker for this
oh i see
[noise]
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
[noise]
i'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative
and um
but i have uh
i have been an a speaker in other uh similar
type of activities uh and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being
gathered and the program and so forth so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker
we haven't talked much about the weather i know that's what we're supposed to do
um-hum
in environmental engineering uh
is that with regard to workplace engineering or just
you know environment the work place environment or
oh i see
um-hum
well i had my [vocalized-noise] the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community the call i received
and so i had uh
i had thought a little bit about it um uh
beforehand
so i
but th- that's interesting i have a um uh a friend who
is a planner
uh a city planner
and one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling
and one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from a an environmental engineer
to
um-hum
oh i see
well that's interesting
[noise]
okay so we've got to talk about music [noise] and um do you like [vocalized-noise] classic rock or modern rock or which kind
no not a seventies baby
is it disco or is it like
[laughter] but
oh okay so so they can get like The Doors and Led Zeppelin yeah that's cool and how about the Rolling Stones
oh that's when that's when they took toured how about um Pink Floyd
okay so so then we got we got some of the same things because
no it's very hard because see well i mean in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen you know t- what- i listen to heavy metal or or classic rock
we're talking about what they th- they call hard rock
like for example let's see uh Bad Company what like
well
well they're like for example AC DC
why have you heard of them okay and stuff like that that's that's that's not really hard rock
okay
well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal
but see for example they have see what what other bands consider it like really hard rock it's like brash metal
which all they do is they have like this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low
[noise]
and what happens is ah everybody gets like totally into the music and then they start dancing around and they just bump into each other
like like they hit each other with their shoulders
and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
no i don't like that music
but that's that's what they do that's that's what some people call like really heavy metal and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also
like really like heavy metal [vocalized-noise] considered like the words heavy metal and like they always talk about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that
[noise]
and just hard rock has th- they don't talk about that they just talk about like life in general like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them
so
okay then well no i said Queen's Reich but
but but oh no you got to like Queen also so because
yeah especially uh oh God what is it A Night at the Opera don't they have a no let's see the one that they have the the whole opera sing in the background
oh
Bo- Bo- Bohemian Rhapsody yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up
because i mean i just love that song
yeah but they had th- that that whole record was pretty good
but then they started going downhill like everybody else
yeah they they're still around they got a new a new CD out but i d- i wouldn't buy it
because see what happens is the oldies see what i like i like the old Rolling Stones i don't like the new stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah well for example i used to like the old Phil Collins an old Genesis and and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required
that was good but it was on it's way of going downhill because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis
and that really like now i hate Phil Collins i can't stand him because i look at him and i say
you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit
and so that's that's what gets me mad
but did did you go see that new Doors movie
yeah i saw it when it opened
yeah well i- it's it's uh you know it's like i was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies
and they both loved the movie right they said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that and then one of them said well everything is great but i'm gonna give it a thumbs down
and they go but why because it's like the end is like really depressing
and so an- but but it's like but it's like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up see i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine
so i mean so for me no but you learn to i mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say
i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too [laughter] you know i was like [laughter]
hey but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants and [laughter] [laughter]
yeah
did did you go to college
oh that's cool
okay
yeah yeah
yeah
well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in
in progression ever in history
so naw about everything
so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies i don't know what they're called you know it's like
like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or or you know like the technology years
because of all the computers and stuff but the seventies got nothing [laughter] i mean nobody cared to name it [laughter] so
yeah i know can you imagine the uh like a big picture of John Travolta and Saturday Night what is it Saturday Night Fever him just standing there you know
but uh yeah that's a good example to look for in history well [vocalized-noise] from now on we're gonna go from the from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step
on the moon to nineteen eighties okay what happened in the middle don't worry don't worry you don't you're not missing anything [vocalized-noise] so
yeah really and that's that's why i guess everybody is yeah it's like
they don't wanna talk about that so they just don't name it i mean it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times
so
oh well let's see yeah okay we've been talking for seven minutes so
okay all right so um i'm gonna leave you alone uh what what are you doing do you have a family
okay
oh i'm sorry
oh okay
[noise]
okay alrighty so then uh have fun doing this it is not that bad bye-bye
[noise]
okay [laughter]
oh i guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies [laughter] because that's
well no that's really when i grew up so that's really what i like better is that kind of music i mean
no no no not that kind of music [laughter] no more like uh rock um you know like Led Zeppelin type [laughter]
right right
[noise]
oh sure sure i went to their concert last year when they were here [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
sure yeah i like the-
okay well i just didn't know that much about music and i wasn't sure what kind of music you know
what what kind of heavy metal are we talking about what
okay like give me some examples [laughter]
oh well Bad Cam- Company's not bad that's not
[laughter] yeah AC DC [laughter] yes [laughter]
[noise]
well okay i guess i didn't really consider that heavy metal i mean i i think when you say heavy metal i'm i'm thinking about like Cinderella you know
well see i don't really care for Cinderella [laughter] but i like AC DC's okay
yeah no i don't really care for that too much i guess
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] is that the kind of music that you like [laughter] oh okay
oh okay
yeah
right
oh sure of course [laughter] Quee- you you talking Queen is that what you said
oh oh oh oh okay
right well sure because Queen was real popular when i was growing up
oh um uh
right right yep yeah
[laughter]
yeah that that was a real good one
well that's true they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that [laughter]
of the Stones yeah i agree that's the new the older stuff
is the best of it the the new stuff's kind of more like today's rock and roll which i don't really care for today's rock and roll too much it's
right yes definitely i agree
uh-huh
right
yeah that
no not yet i guess i've been con- kind of considering it have you seen it yet
was it really good was it
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh
oh okay so you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then
right well that's
[laughter] well no now seventies music i mean i'm like i said you know i don't like disco i've never liked disco you know but
[laughter] well that's true [laughter] that's true [laughter]
but i i was more um in the late seven- well i- i shoul- like mid to late seventies like between seventy five and and seventy nine was more my era um
well no i'm going right now but um no i didn't go then but see i graduated high school in seventy eight
so you know in seventy eight you know rock was really starting to get really heavy you know and real um
i don't know disco was pretty much dead by then so so that's what i mean disco wasn't really my time [laughter]
about music oh okay
uh-huh
that's kind of funny [laughter] you're right i never thought of that the disco years that's what they're calling them
[laughter] yes right [laughter] that's kind of funny
[laughter]
[laughter] that's true well except for Vietnam i mean you know with
yeah well that's very true [laughter] but
oh good i haven't even been keeping track [laughter]
uh yeah we're kind of i was kind of in the middle of supper but it's not a big deal you know i just left it no it's okay because see i didn't see somebody tried to call me last night but i didn't have my number yet i just got it today
and so you know it's okay i i told them i'd be available during this time so [laughter] anyway
okay thanks great bye
[noise]
[noise]
hi Diana
have y'all been able to do much as a family these days
have y'all been able to do much as a as a full family these days all of you
yeah
do you work outside the home
yeah i don't either it makes a little bit easier i think that way
yeah
so you have a break too
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh we have family that's far away it sounds like you might too
yeah
right
and phone calls that's about about it
that's wha- yeah that's what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is [noise] excuse me only fourteen months she she's really getting to the age where she's playing and likes to go places
that that's right
oh that's a big thrill for them
yeah
yeah that's true
have um have you ever been to the Science no it's called the Science Place
we ju- we haven't lived here too long we went there couple weeks ago
and uh
[noise]
oh yeah we i guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two we've only been in i think it's Science Place Two
the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really see- i mean they really seemed to go wild in there
where's that
uh-huh uh-huh
oh yeah
oh that does sound like fun it's a little bit of a ways
oh
[laughter]
that's right [laughter]
uh-huh
that sounds fun too
and and you said a- about Plano and Campbell is the petting
[noise]
that sounds fun i think maybe we'll try to do that
uh-huh
yeah
because they can just do you don't have to have tokens for everything yeah
that does sound like fun well i've gotten some good ideas from you [laughter]
definitely
well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes but i'm sure that'll be
be good was it good talking to you i had a g- i really appreciate your suggestions [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
okay b- bye
[noise]
hi [noise]
pardon me
oh yes we've um been um
we've gone other you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner we take the kids to the park and um [noise]
you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family
no i don't
yeah it does an- an- then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know he'll he'll take them out just to be with them so h- they can have time with him an-
right so and we uh
we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and
have our kids um
you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and
you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and
we just do all kinds of fun things like that an-
yeah we do so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so
and um
yeah right and uh
you know they we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard an-
sit down an-
yeah
right
uh-huh yeah
and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you don't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of
you know extra things so you you make more fun than you know you know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or
yeah or um you know go get a bag of M and M's or something like that they they think that's a lot of fun so we just we try to spend as much time as we can we
you know our wh- our whole weekends are divi- are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something but
during the day you know it's all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us an-
so
yeah so
yes yes that's what
uh-huh
the kids thought that was wonderful
i is
i'm not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went
uh-huh yeah
yeah
yeah they had a lot of fun in there and um there's uh there's some petting you know like uh
uh i think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff
that's on Plano Road um [noise] it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road it's like a little bit past Campbell on Plano Road
and that's a lot of fun they have tours going through there and
um the kids think that was a lot of fun too an-
we take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonald's you know they don't go for the food they go for the to play around and
there's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business
and it's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids
and parents get in free and it's like during the week it's like five dollars admission for child all day
the petting farm yeah
yeah
yeah an- the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit
and it it's uh the kids just had a wonderful time there they you know you just pay that admission and then all the the the rides are free you know th- of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to
and stuff like that but they thought that was a lot of fun you can have birthday parties there an-
i think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza
because there's more for them to do
yeah
right
so they had a lot of fun
yeah i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible so
yeah
yeah that'll be good yeah well it's good talking to you
oh no problem well take care b- bye
[noise]
uh yes i- i used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when i worked for Hewlett Packard
[noise] and uh [noise] he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to Colorado where i was living [noise]
uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um
the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English
it was just some of the [vocalized-noise] excuse me
i've never been there my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month
and uh
i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh
it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't want to go because she didn't play golf or tennis [laughter] and there wasn't really a job for her there
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great
i go oh it was just a place to live
yeah i was
i- i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem um upset about it or anything and
i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it
yeah
i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too good
yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don't know
yeah i don't know cut California in half or something
but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff
um and they make i guess it's no income tax there or fed- no federal income tax something like that
yeah
um yeah i think it's a territory
that makes sense
i mean there's uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam
[noise]
or uh
yeah it's a U S territory and it's just we own it or
yeah
well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it
yeah
yeah
it's definitely a way out of the way where [vocalized-noise] where as
uh-huh
yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by
which
i don't know
[laughter]
no i don't think they would
yeah
but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with
and he was coming he came to America to to go to school
and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there
he was really funny [laughter]
both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's uh
if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not
ones i met have been pretty pretty funny
yeah i don't i didn't hear any major complaints about it um [noise] i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you're a state now or you're your own country or whatever
but um let them decide
yeah
yeah
i think that makes the most sense
hum
okay ha- we have we been on for a long enough time
okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so
[noise]
but uh
it went fine
all right well it was good talking to you Becky bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
so what do you think uh do you know any people from Puerto Rico
oh really
uh-huh
yeah have you ever been there
have you ever been there
really
no i've never been there either i've not known but just a few people from there
one uh there was a girl in
in my flight in in uh Air Force basic training actually who was from there
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
it always sounds more
oh its
i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is
ever- because i spent five years in Europe and everybody goes oh you're so lucky and i'm like well yeah sort of you know it's but having lived there it's not it's not anything like you picture it
you know it's not it's like i still have the fantasies about Hawaii and all that stuff but
and your just like yeah well sort of right [laughter]
but um [noise] what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state
yeah
really i- i think
i'm not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know
[laughter] where are they going to put the other one [laughter]
[laughter]
well where are we where are we going to get another state
[laughter]
[laughter] or Texas no that's not a good idea [laughter]
oh yeah
[noise]
oh yeah because it's just a territory or is that what it's called a territory
okay
is that a U S territory though
that would be kind of bizarre
that's kind of far
[laughter]
well that's true but there is not a whole lot between here and there
where you you start dealing with Guam it's like you know flying over all these other places to get there
[laughter]
My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though
yeah
of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit
[laughter]
i don't think they'd go for that
um-hum
oh yeah do you think
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly they're they're pretty much satisfied with things the way they are
yeah
exactly
really that's why i said you know when it when when their time is right when they're ready for it you know that it will come about
okay
well Rick it's been good talking to you
i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don't they
oh okay
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
yep
i wasn't in Central America but uh talking about Latin America i kind of i consider Latin America to include Central and South America and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years
uh r- realistically i
yes i don't see the the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the
the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this
uh-huh
no i haven't
i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i
it it gets it g- there you you've got this this toss up bet- or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have it's it's um
own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people and then on the other hand uh the uh
the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts
making overtures to the Soviet Union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now we're we're in this dilemma over
uh United States is believes in Democracy and and self-determination where a- but that on the other hand we believe in self-preservation and
uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the inf- Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States' fear of the world which is not only
you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the United States is looks like we're it now
um-hum
right
well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family
yeah oh you can look in
i- y- p- if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this
uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who
uh have been uh
i don't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the who- the incredibly horrible things they did to the
uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get
oh absolutely and n- we set up
and i mean Ted Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh
right
i've the only the only thing i see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies i don't think there'll be Communist power anymore i i can't see Communism in that country carrying on past him
yeah
right
yeah well i i don't know if maybe Communism's the right the right word for it but what we would there'd have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which a- at which you've uh
you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh
organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy
right
right
but cocoa leaves sell real low right now
it seems yeah
absolutely
absolutely i don't it's gonna be hard to um we've th- y- th- y- that's that's where you're absolutely right as we've got to do something in that region to encourage
uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean
right
i got to watch what i say here i never know when the DIA maybe uh listening on my phone [laughter] right
yeah uh it's tempting it's got to be it's got be horribly tempting for those for those
because yeah yeah yeah y- it's not j- it's not just a matter of uh of having an
extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of
of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and y- there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being able to do it a-
oh no
um-hum
right
[noise]
okay i guess we're on
Central America have you ever lived in Central America
do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal
well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic
importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in World War Two
and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain
if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal he had worked with United Fruit Company
there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
and uh he turned them down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there
it's it's really i i haven't been th- i've been to been to Salvador and
and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite
quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or
or do we support uh
you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the
will you uh d- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua
well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua
uh and there were uh there's a big there's a big lake
and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and i've forgotten what the political influence was
but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if it's in the economic interest of the United States
uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if there's no economic benefit
and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is
is his life [vocalized-noise] is his life better off under Communism or or uh or Democratic government you look at Salvador where the
yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if they'll mostly leave him alone
uh and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesn't make uh
doesn't make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh
Central American leaders that uh a- are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh
it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans
have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it
and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh
well what's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it
the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh
what's the what's America's role there and it it uh
with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh Cuba that exception exerts some influence
well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in Salvador
where there is a significant u- under class
[noise] excuse me
and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty
uh surviving
uh the question is would they
you know would they be better off under communism
and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them
uh you know Communism would feed them all
well that
yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know i- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas
to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him
[laughter] yes [laughter]
a- as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
well not that we could be bought but uh
well of course all everything we're saying is being recorded and [laughter]
[laughter]
of course of course
particularly if you're hungry
[vocalized-noise] uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and
you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when
when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people
and help them protect themselves no- not that they
i'm i'm not sure the Catholic church is is is p- particularly political but
you know if somebody's hun-
oh yes yes very much
as a matter of fact i prefer public television
and uh i have particularly enjoy the
English comedies
and the
English mysteries
yes
vociferously
yes
well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television
and i i'm not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh
the
watching what i do watch is uh
usually news and whatever is on public television uh any kind of i also uh
am very fond of great performances in in that regard
but uh
no uh no uh no as a matter of fact
uh Turner Broadcasting
has been uh broadcasting
all of the James Bond movies
every night this week so i have concentrated on watching James Bond movies [laughter] this week [laughter]
well they're showing uh Live and Let Die at this moment and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as 007
so it it
no no that's true i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the
i how would you ruddy uh look uh but uh
oh yes yes
[laughter] well you know he was uh
when was it last year or year before last
he was voted
the
sexiest actor in movies or something
[laughter] i mean the man is sixty two years old if [laughter]
but uh otherwise you know we uh [vocalized-noise] with you know PBS and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've whether you had a chance to watch it on PBS but uh
the series uh Yes Minister
that was about a the interior minist- it was a comedy the interior minister of uh in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah i know well i i'd
i as i said i'm not much of a television watcher i read as i said and uh quite a bit i i read about
two or three novels a week
in addition to all the technical stuff what d- what what do you do what kind of work do you do
at TI
oh i see
um-hum well the last two people who have called both worked for TI and i just wondered huh
um-hum
[laughter] i guess yeah i- i guess we all can
no no i work for GTE
in Maryland yes
well that i guess it it doe-
how did i hear about it well i work you know they're gathering a database for voice processing and that's my field of of work also
so i i know the people at TI who are doing this and i heard about it so i called them and ask if i c- could participate and uh
you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth
we could go back to television shows if you
yes i have
well no that's it you could interpret it that way
uh
i think
what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of
historical truth
but the interpretation that
actually got into the um
the writing of the Bible itself is probably
uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee
uh
did it wr- wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the tr- most of the translations were from Greek
uh well for example uh in Greek there are seven different words for love
okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one ler word for you know l- uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing
so in those tr- those types of interpretations uh
really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical
fact involved just from the
uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available
to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it
you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that
it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way
yeah hey you could well you can interpret that the what the TV show in the same way you can interpret the Bible well uh so
but uh i as as far as that goes i a- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh
i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh
i think so too all right well it's been very pleasant talking to you
and have a good evening
good night
[noise]
[noise]
okay uh my favorite show is Masterpiece Theater and it has been for a long time but
i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i've never met anybody who likes it [laughter] do you by any chance you do
well wouldn't you know [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i watch Mystery too um i- is that what you're referring to okay yeah that is good i like uh do you read
okay well that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books and the plots are more
uh challenging you know than the sitcoms
of regular TV
yeah
uh-huh yeah me too
did you stay up late and catch this Red Dwarf [laughter] oh that was a scream
uh-huh
really uh-huh
huh
[laughter] i used to like him too he was my hero in fact i like Sean Connery to this day
uh-huh yeah
yeah
oh he could never cut it [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah yeah he does
uh-huh
yeah
i liked his accent too
and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh [laughter] sexually oriented and he still comes off great
yes
yeah he had my vote double [laughter]
i don't care [laughter]
uh-huh
uh what's that about
oh yes yes
uh-huh
right
i l- i've seen it several times it's a scream but i had to go to bed i have to get up and and work the next morning i wish they'd put those
that's why i say did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf it came on after Doctor Who on Saturday nights here at least
and it's just of course i don't you know you really it was
i don't think they should show it on during prime time but still
it was funny
uh-huh
yeah
i'm a payroll clerk just an accounting clerk
no uh i have a friend who works for TI and uh i work for a a tire service here in i'm from Dallas
yeah yeah it could be TIers uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else but
i needed the money [laughter] this is five bucks here [laughter] yeah really do you work for TI
[noise]
really how'd you hear oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we
[laughter] yeah
uh-huh
huh
yeah
huh
right
[noise]
[laughter] well you know speaking of public TV have you caught any of this series on the Bible
i've heard that it's really against the well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah
right
uh-huh
huh
yeah
i guess if you're looking for that you're
but uh
uh-huh
really
yeah that's right [laughter]
yeah surely we've made it [laughter] well it was nice talking to you okay you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico
well i'm i guess
i don't have su- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low st- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
um part of this i suppose is justified in i- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th- the more northern territories need
however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there
and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem
um it was
it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
uh
well probably more on in terms of the US
um
you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the US copes
with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so
i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the
the press as i w- you know
and uh bec- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a
new state that is so very very poor
um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
i think so
um-hum
um-hum yeah th- those are good points um which obviously i'd never thought about
um
i don't know wh- uh i suppose
they also not being a state are
probably freer to determine their own
um ways of life than they would if if
i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
perhaps compulsory education
um
and taxes [laughter]
um-hum w- well actually i thin- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
so if they've just taken such action
it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
to declare this before they become a state
or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
i i believe i would probably tend towards that
well that's interesting
right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language
as a condition for statehood
um-hum
um
um-hum um-hum
that's interesting because
although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience
uh
i was in bilingual education in California and
i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
my brother wh- who was uh quite a bit younger
was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
and so obviously it didn't work in California
right
right
oh i see
um-hum um-hum
o- okay well thank you very much
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
i was a
resident although very young of the s- of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state
uh so i guess i have a left over
positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about Puerto Rico
um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i k- have a suspicion that that i
believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
what is your situation
oh that's very interesting
your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or
um-hum
um-hum
i guess
um
we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or
okay
that's something th- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have
um
i don't know whether state woul- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the ve- the act of being a state
would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
i don't know if they suffer
in a sense of
income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
how do you feel though about
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how hav- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the s- in the
Alaska at the time since th- they voted absentee
i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se- feeling of second class citizenry
uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
in their not having a Senate representative
um-hum
uh i see what you mean so that
yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation
um
frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico
um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy
uh
i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country
so
um-hum
[noise]
uh-huh
that's interesting
well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ult- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
at this point
leaning towards uh statehood
i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou- against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something
um
i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-
am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country
and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be
a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
um
i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect
hum
yeah
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language
but i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level
um
i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
good-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes [noise]
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum you're a student
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
um i'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise i
i don't feel like i
i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things
like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time
but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh
you know
mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person
but it's not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that
um-hum
um-hum
yes yes
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
yeah yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because you're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore
yeah
yeah would that we could [laughter]
um-hum um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm well you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather [laughter]
uh
[laughter] so it's the it's it's the the act- well it's actually it's interesting because there are rea- real regional differences um in California there's uh almost an assumption
um
unless you're sort of clearly of an
uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm
i'm not uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i don't know about rural California too well but in urban California it's just
you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here
and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh [noise]
um-hum
yeah
well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of uh you know you'll get
organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the Uni- Uni- Uni- the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter
which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter
monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and
and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's
on fairly s- solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says ev- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together
and uh so it's had that orientation for quite sometime um there's been some progressive medical schools out here
that have taken that approach and um
boy yeah that there's a i- i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of dev- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
yeah and s-
yeah yeah exactly
and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was
um people becoming interested in alternate
practices i don't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know
which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh AMA approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and
and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long
you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options
and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them
the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented
towards
doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me
oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise [laughter]
um-hum
yeah well i- i think so i mean you you've if you look at cert- if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about
people who were considered very healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and
they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know and that that's
and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um
yes as am i actually i as am i
yes [laughter]
it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
well most most mo- sort of modern looking restaurants will
you can
i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh it occurred to me
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
um-hum um-hum um-hum
[noise]
wh- um well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class he's an aerobics instructor
and um is going to be uh entering North Texas for a kinesiology program there
and um [noise] the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach
yeah so i'm i'm an avid aerobics [noise] uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports
so and how do you feel about it [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well i i've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore
so um and i feel that way too as far as
y- you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to
you know a a calc- you know calculated down and and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but i do try and um
i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week
yeah
and it's got and i've always enjoyed dance
so it involves you know i- i can't get out to dance all the time
and yeah [laughter] and it's and it's more regulated i mean you're you're using different parts of the body so it it is like dance an- and it's structured like
that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me
and someone else is telling me okay you know l- let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much
yeah yeah but i'm like you i also um
like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myerson Symphony Run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and um
just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and i- i- i love to swim so i love it when you know it's
swimming weather and uh
oh i didn't realize that i'm sorry well i'm in Texas i- i just assumed that i had this is the first call i've done and i didn't realize that they had were going to
reach out to people from all over the country
you wouldn't know that [laughter] oh i
um-hum
well i think people are are more enc-
people from California seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just
y- y- your health consciousness and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California not just exercise but health health related
ideas and i i- it's curious i don't know why don't know if it's
[vocalized-noise] do you does California have a
um-hum
um-hum
now do you think that's because they've realized that
for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program
do you think the program came first or the [laughter]
yeah the more money they put into it i can see that because i knowing from institutes of [vocalized-noise] learning like that i know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
or they're older well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar- i- i- i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the
it's it's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um [noise] almost you know doesn't worry about it to such a degree but
stays you know more healthier you know as a fit person
um-hum
yeah well don't you think a lot of that is diet too yeah
um-hum
yeah and as we can see well i'm a i'm a practicing vegetarian so uh i've read a lot of information knowing that to be true what's that [noise]
oh are you also [laughter] well that's that's good as far as the cal- is that is that um pretty predominant as far as California do do
in the urban areas
um-hum oh that's wonderful
yeah that's great i mean we uh it's such a tr- it's such a trouble here i mean you just have to eat at home basically
well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so um which
y- you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so
you're gonna have a lot of [vocalized-noise] more choices but in urban areas it's you know steak places an and it's not a you know it's uh [noise] definitely it it's it's changing to a degree but
um [noise] it's very frustrating and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh
organic you know materials and foods and things you don't really have that i mean you would think
i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter
uh [vocalized-noise] we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one
um course i've only lived here three years but uh but that i- still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
oh [laughter]
yeah
right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock
uh-huh
wow yeah
dust storms whoa [laughter] yeah
huh
well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven
and uh we when we lef- we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing
[noise] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm
uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather
and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um
uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it
and but you al- you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm
um y- the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year
it it uh w- it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass
you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
oh
sure
[laughter]
right yeah
right
[laughter] well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh j- we just
you know in up in New England you had more winter than you had a s- summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um [noise]
we cou- you cou- uh in New England it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in March it ju- in March is is just when things
start uh approaching the fifty degree mark a- course we've already had eighty degree weather here and d- day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think
[noise] oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in September it would start getting cold in September
there could be yeah there could be a- and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away
and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway
and that's so i could leave by seven
and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then i'd sitting in that car for an hour an a half
and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work
so and so now it takes me ten minutes [laughter]
oh yeah
[noise]
uh well they not they didn't expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and y- the schools well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the streets
they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here
if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the
right right you know you y- you'd you get the first you know the f- first ice
uh storm and the place closes up
yes uh-huh
yeah
[laughter] there's nobody there yeah yeah i that happens a lot i- i just live ten minutes away and i don't w- i don't work in the at the Dallas site i work at the Spring Creek site which is which is in Plano
and uh and so i usually i can usually make it in it's just a hop jump and a
uh whatever the expression is i'm i'm real close [laughter] right [laughter] um but uh yeah i'd i'd hate to have to get it go to Dall- drive into Dallas when the weather's like that
oh yeah oh yeah well it's like i keep telling people you don't have to shovel sunshine you know it's uh it's uh
it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about New England you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big
you know thick trees we used to have in New England and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had two acres of land and um
and so we that now we have this we have a house that's three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot you know and uh and uh
that's right and uh so we kind of i- it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we c- oh the weather's been wonderful
oh ye- yeah
yeah
yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the air's real brisk and the
the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i- i keep i'm [laughter] i get homesick thinking about it you know [laughter]
oh yeah humid very humid in New England i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean i- in in like in the Boston area i Boston's right on the water
and uh you'd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just o- hundred percent and it was stifling
uh here y- in in Dallas in the Dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but it's not nearly as bad you ge- you get a lot of dry days too
is it [laughter] is it okay
yeah
okay
oh
[laughter]
yeah
yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because i grew up on the east coast
and uh i'm originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity
and compared to the humidity here
you know in fact uh whenever i think about mo- you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here
my husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad Lubbock
we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with
uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed
any of the real bad weather this year because we went to California instead [laughter] but right now
um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're try- it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either
uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere
well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh
pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were
uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street
that dust yeah [laughter] not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years
so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but
i guess i can live with it [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
that's true
[laughter]
[laughter]
well now does Dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm
okay
well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand Lubbock Texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees
came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter
and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again
uh it was beautiful but that's about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind
but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer
now was there actually snow on the ground all th- that time from September through what March
oh goodness
uh-huh
oh
[laughter]
oh my goodness
well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or
yeah
everything stops yeah
well now do you work at TI
i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work [laughter]
oh okay
[laughter] hop skip and a jump there you go
well that's good
well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that you're getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the winters or
[laughter]
oh my goodness
sure once you're out of the house you're in the street
[noise] that's good i did go up to New England one time during their fall season when the weather was just
you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh
uh-oh well what about your summers in Dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there
yeah
well so that's really no big t- i tell you what that's funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to Dallas in the summer
is stifling humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's
you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again
yeah
oh
yeah
all right
i play volleyball and
softball and ceramics
i didn't think of working out as a hobby
[laughter]
or playing with the computer i do both at home
uh we've gotten a little Atari computer uh husband describes it as a a computer with training wheels
uh
no i i do ceramics i i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them
uh you know you get them you clean them up you know get the uh mold line off
you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible uh
then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know it's like a big ogen oven
and uh when you pull it out it's called bisque uh it started it off with greenware
when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it
no i've uh
y- you can rent people's kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted
the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy
now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i'd say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they're no no
thirty two pieces is a was co- cost me about eight dollars
no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to
get parts that had big spaces in them
uh couldn't do the fine -tailed fine detail on it
but uh you know i made my son his uh Donald Duck and you know the Disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors
and uh he enjoyed them till he was about two and then he uh had fun throwing them and broke them
a- that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them
yeah well i didn't get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him
i workout with that uh ESPN
the people on ESPN
i workout with them or try to
yeah well i don't work
so i do it in the mornings
i haven't worked out in quite awhile i play volleyball i guess that's good enough workout
yeah it's fun
at once a week uh s- sometimes we play two ni- games a night you know consist of uh fifteen point game and you play two games and you know the best uh person that wins two games wins
and uh few times we've had a tie breaker so i played three games
and uh
then we'll get a half hour break or so and then i'll go and play another set with somebody else you know
it's fun
[laughter]
yeah well uh i've torn mine up uh you know uh we play with a church team so we're not competitive we're just having fun
and uh when i played softball it was with the church team it was just for fun although the church team we made it to the nationals we were ranked fifteenth in the nation so i you know i'm proud of that
but that was a for ano- you know i was in another state then
so i'm not with the same softball team
but they're starting up soon so i'll be playing again
it's
it's a good way to get out with people and you don't have to uh
uh let's see what's the word
they have fun without doing
the drinking and all that
and uh you know you don't hear a lot of
angry words i'll you know be nice and uh you know it's going out to have fun
because it you know it's a it's a hobby you do not want to be stressed out after playing
um-hum
yeah well uh get back to compooter co- programming of yours uh [laughter]
i've been uh trying to program some uh
disk or some uh what do you call them putting some programs into the on the disk
and uh i'll get to about fifteen sixteen lines and i'd mess up and it just says you have entered a error in line and i don't see how people do that that drives me batty
yeah
[laughter] the closest i come to uh
having a uh program work on me was the the Atari toot toot
[laughter]
and you know that was just a couple lines and you push a button and you hear a train and then the the the toot toot
[laughter]
[laughter] the kids like it though they think it's a hilarious
uh
all right thank you bye-bye
[noise]
ceramics sounds interesting uh i do computer programming kind of as a ho- on the side and i also like to uh do gardening and also like to workout
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i i uh i work with computers at work and then i come home and d- and i have uh a little lap top at home that i just like to play with
[laughter]
yeah
well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of uh a lot of vases and things or
what kind of
oh
um-hum
um-hum
huh
do you have your own kiln or do you do you
oh
oh well that that doesn't sound like it's too expensive a hobby does uh does the uh clay and and the paints and things are they expensive
um-hum
well that doesn't sound very expensive to me
um-hum
yeah
hum
uh-huh
hm
oh no [laughter]
well
well children will tend to do that
oh
well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to just to have something to do that that i know isn't going to that's that's good for me something to do other than
excuse me
uh-huh
occasionally i'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while i'm at work and i'll do them when i get home
hm
yeah well i i really
i enjoy doing that
that is that can be a a w- uh big workout do you play volleyball a lot
hm
yeah
yeah
hm
yeah i i enjoy volleyball i'm just not very good at it and i end up j-
killing my knees [noise]
[noise]
huh [noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
wow
yeah
[noise]
oh
[noise]
yeah [noise]
i have several friends that play softball they play softball in different church leagues
around town
[noise]
yeah yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
no kidding hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable they're not supposed to be difficult or or they're not supposed to make you less relaxed than when you began
[noise]
uh-huh [noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
[laughter]
well i i have a a Computer Information Systems degree from school and i've been at it awhile so you know you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and
and move on
[noise]
[laughter]
hum
yeah
yeah
well i need to run i enjoyed talking to you
[noise]
sure bye-bye
[noise]
oh now that's nice yeah
somewhat business attire yeah
right
[laughter]
right
exactly well i i work uh i'm a financial analyst and uh uh
in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh
a lot of times in the summer i'll try to uh like on a Friday i'll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf
so uh i'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that's okay that's appropriate
not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh
is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh
to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i don't know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere
right
see i think that's exactly right you know if if you're uh if you're dressed in a uh a suit and uh
to me it ma- it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself
and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that l- little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way
oh i see
exactly
oh Lord and down in Houston it'd be so hot yeah
right
i see
right
right
i see
right right
and i think clothing you know i- it just uh
it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so y- you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh
a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude
i see
i'm i'm sure that's true yeah
right
yeah see the winter season's just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh
in the the heavier heavier materials
right
exactly exactly
right
and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men's clothing
because uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats ne- nearly all year round
and uh ladies you know uh uh i don't know if that's marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer
true
right
right
exactly
plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a h- all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it's
uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i don't know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress
i'm not for sure it's that one in September is when you need to quit
yeah [laughter]
right
i see right
exactly exactly
[laughter]
exac- a lot more uh that's right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance
right
i live here in Plano yeah
[laughter]
oh really
huh
yeah
right
exactly and i think that's you know a North Dallas type attitude
and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church
and uh
i don't know that's that's uh because i i went to school wi- at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock
and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it's like going to a fashion show almost
right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah
right
you can't just wear your sweats and an old T-shirt and
[laughter]
right
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call
you too bye-bye
[noise]
well i haven't uh i've been working in my own home for just um
about the last three years bu- so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i t- taught at the University of Houston and um
so i tried to wear things that were
comfortable but still tried to look you know [vocalized-noise]
yes bu- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn't have as good control over the class
and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike
um-hum
uh-huh
oh that's nice [laughter]
well do you um
meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or
um-hum
well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they're wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too
um-hum um-hum
well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um
that because i taught English as a second language so i didn't have your average freshman student and um so i
i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be their equal
and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to w- park pretty far away from
yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large
so i preferred slacks and um you know
kind of dressy shirts and things but
so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and
didn't make me have um to much trouble and
[noise] with the students
um-hum
well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to
totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and
and
no and you don't um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater
or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with
different shoes you know we always had like um
higher
higher shoes higher tops on them rather than just um the lower
skimm- skimmers i think they call them that you would wear day-to-day but
um-hum
that's really true a lot of it is um
the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable
you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather [laughter]
and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and
i guess part of that is um
just the physics of it that in what isn't it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so
[laughter]
um-hum
that's true there's some rule that's like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day
uh-huh right and the one that's like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we don't have an opportunity my husband and i we don't go to a lot of like where you have to wear
a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two
holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society
go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about [laughter]
um-hum
yes
i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i don't know where you are but um
oh you do that there there is a pretty um
i wouldn't say snobbish [laughter] but it it's kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i'm wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since
uh where you know from where i've lived in Houston that you have to in order to get
the attention you might need help
you need to be you can't just come in off the street is what i'm trying to say [laughter]
oh is it
um-hum
um-hum
yes i think i think your right i've noticed that too it's just it's very different but i've
i think um it's kind of sad when you have to
go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop
[laughter]
yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything
no
you can't just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation we've had about clothing i know i've it's interesting to hear a man's point of view it's usually my husband
he's got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes [laughter] and they magically [laughter]
well thank you and you have a good day okay bye-bye
[noise]
all right um i think the topic was crime in the city
i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place
uh it's about thirty miles from Sherman
it's north of Sherman
uh it not too far [laughter]
huh
uh i've been through there
okay oh yeah i had been through Saint Joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad
um-hum
oh yeah
sure
uh-huh
oh i know i know
i know um peo- i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum yeah because uh most likely that will happen won't it that you know
um-hum
uh-huh
no
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
hum
uh-huh
hum so you're you're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know
yeah to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh
oh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
no apparently not because look how many years they've been doing that and look [laughter] i mean yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
three or four times yeah
that is true i know
um-hum oh i'm i agree very much so on that i yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
comes yeah
um-hum
sure they just think that's the normal thing to do don't they
y- yeah
um-hum
in the first grade
oh no [laughter]
um-hum
uh-huh
oh i know i know um [noise] i work in school
you know that's huh-uh but something i do and i it really is i'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know
if they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school you know it really is
and that's kind of sad
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
teen
huh uh-huh
uh-huh
cause yeah
right
where is that
north south east or west
well you live almost in Oklahoma
yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from Oklahoma either
you know where Saint Joe is
i'm about eight miles south of it
well you know
i've i've seen those statistics and everything
and you know what frightens me
is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert
with high tech weaponry
you know i mean
the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that
and they didn't kill as many people in
in forty five days
and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job
as they killed in Washington DC
well
i formulated a pretty radical theory
over the last ten years i guess
and
i've come to the conclusion
and this is [vocalized-noise]
a pretty scary thought to me even
that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime
rather than put them in prison because prison's proven not to work
just let them go
say okay you're convicted
and just let them go
and if they get convicted again
well just kill them
well i think that
the best hope
to eliminate
crime
as we know it today
is to eliminate the criminals from society
if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job
you know they can't be accepted into society
you know if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic
and you know who's to put the limit on it
i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State
if you get convicted of uh
sexual offenses
on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions
and they're still let out on the street after one or two years
well in Washington State if you're a habitual sexual offender
they just don't let you out
uh you serve your prison term
and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go
well
they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now
you know
hey people make mistakes
well
yeah use that or you know there's other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
you know
at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against
feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them
but uh you know with the tech- technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg
that will knock him down if they leave the property
i mean it will just in incapacitate them
and you can put a collar around a guys leg
that will
prohibit them
from committing any kind of
you know prohibitive act
but you know putting them in prison my God that doesn't work
well you look at places like Turkey
Turkey has death penalty for just about everything
i mean if you get
convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you
you get convicted of uh
you know uh heinous crimes
they just kill you i mean there's no two ways about it
and uh
you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few
you know and you look at our society
almost everyone out on the street
that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times
right i mean you know
you know the way to stop that kind of behavior
is this two fold
one
you need to make it illegal for
both parents to work while the kids are under seven
i- i think that's very important
and then
if a parent has proved to be unfit
for any reason
take the kids away from the parents
because
you know we are what we teach
because that's what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people
and i've and i've i've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work
you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone
i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building
and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs
and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday
and the kids of these people
are phenomenally
they're sociopathic
and i worked in a first grade uh classroom
for one full semester
and these kids were more foul mouthed than i've ever been
i had one kid threaten my life first grader
threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death
you know and they flipping me the finger and all that
and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die
because you will eventually be killed
and [vocalized-noise] you know i just i'm just totally a- aghast at a what's going on
um-hum
exactly
well you can see it in the work place
you know
used to be when you had a
personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it
now
you know people get fired
or
[laughter]
what's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired
or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the Japanese
you put
that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together
okay it's in their culture
and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially
the people that worked for those companies
worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen
and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people
if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them
they made a position for them some where
uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay
as a typist
you know transcribing stuff into the computer
well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute
but she don't like it
she she just doesn't like to do that i mean she will
but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
um what kind of hobbies do you have
really i like cross-stitch too
[laughter]
i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh several years my husband is even interested in it now he likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized
[laughter]
not that hard i really i really enjoy it
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
um i do mostly that um not very artistic really for like painting and stuff
but now i don't know
oh really
yeah i've got the kits to to put them all in i don't have them all yet
certainly
oh yeah
i just i i just keep an inventory of what i currently have and then when i start a a new project i go through and see if i if i you know just buy the colors that i need of what i'm low on
um-hum
yeah a lot of times you can do that
think the i think the pinks there's like forty two different shades of pink
[laughter]
pinks and greens yeah
um-hum
yeah
well not lately
[laughter]
i even started a new job and trying to get
acclimated there
yeah how old
oh yeah
[laughter]
oh yeah
yeah
yeah well last year he was a little bit young for having one
probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway [laughter]
[laughter]
you would have but
oh yeah
yeah that's that's kind of strange [laughter] that we got the same call
it to whi- oh
no that's okay
oh wow no i just started about
well five years ago i think
um-hum
there's [noise] bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans and got one done and i think the other one's gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get finished
embarrassing
well yeah i just i bought the cloth and the the pattern for it i didn't um i didn't buy the uh i didn't buy a kit
uh-huh it's it's that cloth it's called Anne Cloth i think and it has the borders and everything already
number one turned out just great and the lady said she couldn't believe that
they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the uh
the nursery and i didn't even know it
sh- i gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used i said
didn't [laughter]
just worked out that way
um-hum
yeah
Lilly yeah Lilly she she said i said it's for it's for your daughter to use oh no she said i know she doesn't get to touch it she hung it on the wall
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
yeah
um true
okay
you too all righty bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
um i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time
oh i love it [laughter]
i- that's my case also i've got a new born and and there's just no time
have have you been cross-stitching long
oh really
mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material
[laughter]
but oh its not
and once uh once you get started on it it's just oh i just l- i love it [vocalized-noise] i do a lot of my own patterns also
in fact i did one uh Bill the Cat you know from Glenn County
that uh was a real good one to do
it was it was tough but uh
yeah do you have any others or is it just mainly cross-stitch
oh uh-huh
um
yeah uh b- i- w- i'm still trying to get all the DMC colors [laughter]
uh right yeah uh got to counting the other day and uh i think i have what was it two hundred and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this
is uh it uh yeah it can add up quick
um-hum
right i see well now can i
improvise with adding using another c- color instead you know what comes close
because a lot of them are are similar
good grief yeah there's there's lots of pinks and and greens
there's lots of shades of greens
but the colors are i just love all the different colors
they had they had quite a few new ones come out last year
that they added to
b- but ah you don't have much spare time either
[laughter]
oh yes and that does take sometime yes we're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby and there's just he's uh seven months old
and uh just into everything so there's not a spare moment [laughter]
[laughter] oh [laughter] but i wouldn't trade it for the world i've been trying to do some bibs for him
and uh a- and work on his Christmas stocking
we missed it the the last year so hopefully this year he'll have one
uh right right
[laughter] he oh he liked [laughter] right if it tasted good yeah uh
uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year so
[noise]
oh well that's neat that uh you like cross-stitch also
[laughter]
yeah uh uh
oh i'm sorry go ahead
okay uh but yeah i've been doing it for probably about ten years or so
but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do
once you find the time to do it
oh
[laughter]
on that uh is it one of those uh afghans that i've seen in the packages or the the s- large squares
oh uh-huh well i've seen the afghans in the in the
stores that uh are designed for cross-stitch
oh okay
um-hum
yeah
those are pretty
oh that's a coincidence
[laughter] that was a good coincidence
[laughter]

i like those those are pretty
[laughter]
yes my uh grandmother uh made us a couple of quilts for the baby and i was like oh i don't want to mess those up

oh yeah
well i've enjoyed this
uh but uh well keep up the good um well keep up the cross-stitching
all right thanks bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
so let me tell you a little bit about the weather here last Sunday night we had an ice storm
which took down all of our trees all the power lines all the phone lines
it was i- it was incredible it um it occurred about two thirty at night
or in the morning actually um for the past six days we've been out heat without power
um without a phone we've basically been living out of suitcases at friend's house that happened to have power it's really been horrible
we're um we live in Rochester New York
so i mean normally you know this time of year it's very cold and we have a lot of snow and and all that and this has just been something we've we've never seen an ice storm like this before
and people that actually were staying home um
without any heat they were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the house without any heat
it's really been crazy
uh
are you serious
do are you someone that likes the heat
um-hum
um-hum
what is it normally like there this time of year
so would it
today it's sixty five
oh that's great you must be feeling like it's uh
oh that's so nice
um-hum
yeah compared to what we're having
[noise]
yeah
so what's the lowest that the temperature would ever get there
um-hum
they did oh wow
this past Thursday we had winds and and snow to the point where if you walked outside and if you're walking against the wind
you almost couldn't move because the wind w- wouldn't let you walk it was so strong it was really
well um on Monday all the businesses were closed
and then on Tuesday i would say about half of the businesses were closed
um they finally opened up again i- i don't want to even say as normal because nothing was really normal this week people were [noise] faced with
trees through their cars you know trees had fallen right on top of their cars um
other people had had trees go right through there rooftops
it's just i- th- as a matter of fact um Governor Cuomo the Governor of New York
is supposedly asking Bush now to declare Rochester um a disasters area
and obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess
but it's really you know besides just the inconvenience of it all it's it's pretty sad because
Rochester had some nice parks and some really beautiful tree lined streets and they're all just destroyed
they were all torn down um the ice i- it was really just a crippling
thing for the whole city
i can imagine there be
yeah
really
oh that's funny
um-hum
oh jeez
yeah
well i grew up in Boston and in Boston um we get our share of snow but it was always very very well cleaned up
they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know it would then the next morning it would be fine
and in Rochester they i guess they feel that they get so much snow that they don't clean it up for just a little bit
so even for three or four inches you're just driving right on it the streets haven't been plowed
there's no salt on the ground nothing they wait -til they get a major storm
oh really
um-hum
oh
really
oh my gosh
um-hum
that's crazy
sure
oh i'm s-
oh [laughter]
i thought you were saying can you hold on oh okay
uh oh i see [laughter]
[noise]
well i just came back from getting our new clothes for today and we'll try l- we stayed all last week with one set of friends and um
they were having company this weekend so we had to move and you just feel like you're imposing on people you know
oh no they're averaging um well there estimating that next by next Thursday
everybody should have there power back
the schools were all closed this week and they're still thinking of closing them on Monday because
for little kids it's it's still kind of dangerous on to be on the sidewalks because there might be some live wires hanging down and
and there're a lot of streets that are just closed
because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort of thing
but i- one thing that was very funny is on Monday um almost every single store in Rochester had been sold out of batteries
because people are needing batteries for portable radios and flashlights and
really and we had uh you know a -fr- a refrigerator full of food and a freezer full of food
and that's all been just you know it's you can't use it it's it's just gone bad
so this storm really i- uh it's been incredible
right exactly as a matter of fact we made on to i don't know if you ever watch Dan Rather
the CBS news
he mentioned um i guess it was Monday night or Tuesday night he mentioned the state of emergency
and we all felt like finally we made it to the national news [laughter] but
i don't know i would much rather be in the warm of sun
um-hum
well throughout all of this i called my in-laws who live in Florida
and they just finished putting in a pool
so while i was sitting freezing in a pay phone outside of our house
um they were sitting by the pool sipping you know a glass of wine and
oh it was really it was horrible
but
it really is
oh you do oh
i remember the earthquake last year and i y- you know i guess you didn't you like the earthquake over in San Francisco remember that and
you know you can hear about it on TV and you just think so
yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you
but
um-hum
yeah that's true
well western New York is suppose to be use to this kind of weather but
right now people uh the the crews that are
no it's true
but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to
sixty degrees they feel that's too hot
and they just they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and and that's why they live here i guess but
y- you for the month between basically November and April
if you don't like the snow and the cold then you might as well just pack your bags and leave
because that's all that's all there is here
oh yeah
um-hum
that is great what do you plant this time of year
and what
[noise]
where do you live
oh
oh
oh my word
yeah oh well we've had unseasonably warm weather here in Texas we um
last week if it was uh i believe it was Monday or Tuesday we had had ninety four degrees
uh-huh yep yep
um i grew up in Wyoming so i you know we had
i didn't mind the heat then
um the summer time the summer's here get real hot and i have a hard time with those but i get use to them you just kind of stay indoors
um i- this time of year you know sixties and you know stuff like that so
today i think it's about sixty five today here something like that so
uh-huh
yeah it's
yeah my husband's outside in a short sleeve shirt right now working in the garden and we've planted our garden
and
yeah we've been you know we've been working in the yard and our peach tree's blooming so we have very warm weather here right now compared to what you're having
i grew up in the you know i grew up in Wyoming i remember ice storms and
we get ice storms here but we haven't had one you know in a long time but
uh the lowest temperature that it gets here
um in the winter time this winter we had um some temperatures get below zero
and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was
it was you know it doesn't you know it was real unusual
so
hum
hum are people going to work around there in this
um-hum
uh-huh
uh
uh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh you know when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city
yeah because nobody knows how to drive in it so when you get i mean
here they start even forecast the weather you know it's gonna be an ice storm tomorrow
they'll come before the ten clock news they've already got schools calling in saying they've canceled
yeah they don't even wait around here to see if they canceled it [vocalized-noise] in the night before and
[noise] we've had them you know say that they're going to be get this real bad ice storm and
um it's beautiful the next day i mean the weather here is so unpredictable you know i i don't even put much stock in the weather reports anymore because they're hardly ever
accurate
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
yeah they get a little bit of i- rain here and they suspect it's going to freeze and the sand trucks are out
yeah because we have you know
it gets even in a rainstorm here that roads get so slick
you know it's no not even cold weather but just rain because the roads get so oily
that uh
we've had you know twelve car pile ups and stuff on the freeways because
people just they don't slow down for nothing around here so
do you want it off
oh uh no i'm talking to my daughter she wanted her shoe off
sorry
no no i was talking my little girl wanted her shoes off
[laughter]
so
uh
uh-huh
you don't even have power back to your house yet
my word
yeah
oh
um
uh
you need to stock up on batteries then
uh-huh
destroyed
ruined
yeah you have to have some food to eat because the grocery stores probably ran out real fast
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh wow
yeah yeah because it's beautiful here today i haven't gone outside been too busy working inside but
it's beautiful here
oh
uh
yeah it's amazing how it can be so different in one part of the country
s- because i have family in Boston too so um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
but going through it's so much different yeah
uh-huh yeah because his family my husband's family lives in
in um Anaheim California you know just
couple you know miles from Disneyland and
so it's amazing how it's you know it can be cold here and beautiful there s-
yeah
uh-huh
you could never get use to that kind of weather
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh right
that's how it was in Wyoming too you just you know it was always cold then you can you only had um two or three months that you could plant a garden
and here we can get three gardens in a year
we can replant three times a year and and get stuff so
um we've got onions and potatoes and um
broccoli and
what else all that kinds of stuff like that planted
hi Gary hi today is uh Saturday have you found spare time to do any hobbies
is that right
inside your house like cactus gardens and the like
that's nice
we do the same kind of things though we've been concentrating on outside lately trying to do some gardening and uh planting a lot of trees and flowers
from the winter
yeah
we have a couple of those too
we uh we haven't planted a garden yet we m- t- moved here from Colorado not too long ago where we had a really big garden
but here i i- know i hear i hear that the uh growing is a little bit different
have you had a garden
um-hum
have you ever tried new vegetables yeah
[noise] i thought we had yeah we just
[vocalized-noise] it gets so hot i just wonder you know what what vegetables can really take that heat
we'll see
that's true
well i do some oh some needle crafts things hobbies sometimes some cross stitch um
no no sewing or knitting any of that um [noise] we'll see some cross stitch you know some gifts that i make for friends and families that kind of thing
anything else you you do in your spare time
yeah
i have two small children so i started to you know have them enrolled like in soccer and things like that i tend to be more of a spectator these days than participating
yeah it's beautiful
mine's got a flat tire so i'm gonna have to do something about that
well i don't uh have too much else i do in my spare time how about you
i- that right did he sell them at craft shows and
um-hum
well that's neat
um-hum
[laughter]
is it pottery or is it wood
oh that's beautiful
um-hum
oh that sounds neat how about like big salad bowls those kind of things
um-hum
boy they sound nice well i don't think i've ever seen wooden plates at any of the craft shows
um-hum
that sounds like a unique item
uh-huh
well that's good keeps them active i'm sure [laughter] well it was good talking to you
alrighty
good luck with your indoor gardening there
i'll talk to you later um-hum bye-bye
[noise]
hello
uh yeah as a matter of fact i went to uh one of the nurseries and uh bought myself another cactus plant [noise] i've got many uh shrubs inside the house
inside yeah um-hum
[noise] uh yeah in th- s- south window in the bathroom i've got uh quite a few
and uh along with all the other uh uh plants i've got in the house a lot of different types
yeah i- i'm assessing the damage outside right now i've got couple of a few shrubs i need to replace outside
[noise] yeah they didn't uh survive the freeze
uh yeah well i've got uh oh several uh shrubs outside uh out there [laughter] depending on
no i never have uh no vegetable gardens uh used to have that when i lived with my folks up in Wisconsin they always grew a lot of vegetables
but
no vegetables here a lot of evergreens
well there's there's quite a few that can handle that uh any local nursery will be able to help you with with something like that
um besides uh gardening what other uh types of things are you interested in
okay
oh ye- well i play softball a couple of times a year it's they're getting ready to start up the the season again
oh the day like today it's so nice outside you like to get out there and do something uh
need to break out the bicycle too get that down and start to ride around
[laughter]
uh-huh
[noise] well um i'm not uh much of a a woodworker myself but my dad owns a shop and he uh makes quite a few uh arts and crafts jus- type things out of wood and um
yeah they go to arts and crafts fairs and uh have their uh stand that they set up display all their uh all their products lots of vases and plates and bowls
things of that nature i'm probably the best customer i've got the house stocked with uh lot of their stuff
[noise]
no it's it's wood turning
a- he's got a got a lathe and all kinds he's got a shop full of equipment and they uh he turns turns out bowls and vases
of uh all different types of exotic woods
uh yeah yeah some some like that uh uh lots of uh different types of vases uh ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on tables
and uh he's been doing a lot of uh lot of decorative type plates lately
okay uh well there are shops around here that have uh items like that uh not too many with the style that he uses though so
yeah they're they're uh quite unique and uh it's well he's retired so it it's something to do in the spare time they've got a lot of time to to work on that now
uh-huh
okay is that uh that's [laughter]
all right
appreciate it thanks bye
[noise]
all right do you have any kids
i've got two and it is hard to find day care for them
oh
well i i've seen the bad side in most of them
i took my son to a day care one time when he was j- [vocalized-noise] you know just uh not even three months old and uh you know it was a desperate thing
and uh when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been [vocalized-noise] crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep
and uh you know this uh couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares
and then when i took uh
i've seen these kids that uh
it's a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for people playing volleyball and uh one of the girls was real mean to the kid
and that was you know he she'd just she had treated him like family does you know and um
it you know it uh i know most of the girls up there and the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesn't like people too much
but uh when when we leave there he uh gives the girl a hug and tells her i'll miss you so you know
so i know they treat him good
uh
yeah yeah uh [vocalized-noise] i don't know much about day cares itself you know uh you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under
and uh there's only there's two people taking care of about five kids uh where i'm where i'm taking my two
and but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at best i guess
you know and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids
uh
no there's not nobody can take care of your kids better than you
well i had to quit my job because of uh m- my two you know uh day care wise or babysittingwise and stuff
uh because you know my sister was keeping them uh uh we just lucked out and she uh met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI
and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her so i just quit i'd rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them
well you know they're getting raised right
yeah
yeah if um
i i know one church that uh there was some problems with but that was just uh basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was t- in charge
but uh
the church uh day care that my kids uh they don't go to a day care you know it's uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice
yeah well they
i think it's one of the important things
if uh because if they don't like it uh you can't get them that separation thing and i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them they're not very old but
three and uh four and two
so you know they're they're good kids you know they do bad things but they're good kids
[laughter] yeah uh but
i don't like the punishment the day care does you know i don't know exactly what they do but i don't want no one punishing my kids but myself
and that's another problem with day care because you're not there so you don't what they're doing
and if
yeah that's that's that's something that should be brought up with these people
i don't know if they do it either to be truthful
well uh
with me i just decided not to face it and you know in most in in so many words you know in one way or the other i just decided not to face that issue and i just keep them with me
[laughter]
yeah so have i oh
oh well thanks and i guess i w- we've been on long enough so you have a good day all right bye-bye
[noise]
okay
no
what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those
what would you like to see in one
uh-huh
yeah
i bet
uh-huh
hm
yeah
yeah
oh well that's good
yeah
is it
i don't know maybe would you think a
better student to teacher ratio
do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have
um-hum
uh-huh
oh my goodness
yeah um we don't yeah we don't have any but we have you know plenty of sisters and brothers that that have them and
i'm not sure that there is a solution to that as far as uh th- d- there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want but
it seems you know that there's not really the perfect one out there
right and that's not even possible anymore i don't think to be able to take care of your own kids without you know with everybody working these days
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah that seems probably the best way to do it
yeah yeah um
i haven't really the only day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem to
from my experience be the best at what they're doing just because of what they're based on
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i th- i think that's that's important
um-hum
yeah
how old are they
oh
um-hum
but you know kids kids do those
uh-huh
right
right right
yeah they're probably i would think needs to be i don't know if they have any type of uh formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of agencies
you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know they drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law and
and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see what's going on
so but i'm not really sure
yeah i don't either it's not until you have kids i guess you worry about those things
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
well
i don't know what we've done to solve any of this [laughter] but i've enjoyed talking with you
and welcome to Texas
thank you bye-bye
[noise]
okay did it click okay um well how do you feel about food and cooking
um-hum
well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half
and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and
it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of
uh things that you want to eat that aren't veg- you know that aren't don't contain meat products or don't contain animal products but maybe aren't you know uh balanced meal so to speak
so but we we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians
i did at first but um not really no not i- i can't imagine eating meat
um the reason i tranged uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i- i think of it as something alive
you know so it i can't do it you know f- for me it's it just
but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly uh say steak or something you know that i- i do admit that i
you know s- wish you know that i could have that flavor but but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don't want it but
yeah you you'd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we're having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger
and you can it's really pretty good i- i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members
well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they're not they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other m- you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals
and uh you can ma- you know make uh pasta meals and
different things that people are use to eating that wouldn't offend you know that they wouldn't be offended that there wasn't a meat there
you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that's not that doesn't have any animal produ- animal you know
you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat
yeah we do eat i- i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs
and that's even more difficult it's really hard to find the products and it's hard that's even harder to keep yourself from eating
because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or
you know it really makes a difference
a- eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things
so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so but um
yeah it if well it really is because t- just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i
you know i wasn't really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store we've been living in Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a um [noise] a health food store that really had a lot of good stuff
and where we're living now is a small town that really doesn't you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores
and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which
yeah see that lot of people don't and that's
yeah like lentil soup or something people don't and that's such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it's something really
horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so um
it's it's just a matter of learning you know
yeah so but it
um-hum
yeah well think of it a- think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest
and you know if you've got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting so you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat
you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat
so
[laughter] um
you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you ju-
no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh we're living with my family my folks now so
you know they they have the turkey you know they do they ca- they you can't stop you know everyone's life but um
i think if in our own house we didn't we would have things like a casserole things like that that centered more on
the vegetables as far as
we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing
and and i suppose because it's for me ethical we'd just play up the fact that
Thanksgiving's you know is a time for everyone to give thanks even turkey you know yeah
so
um
but it it's interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks um
which
yeah yeah lots of them lots of them and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it's called Sundays at the Moosewood Restaurant and
uh it's out of New York it's a pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything
[vocalized-noise] no we don't eat fish either but it the majority of the book is um vegetarian with no meats so or you know of any any kind of animal
so there's quite a few out there
um-hum
yeah it's strange because well it it's not strange because i use to be the same way and i'm even to this day [vocalized-noise] you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information that says
this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what's the real reason your eating i know i know it's for taste because i'm boy am i a taste person but
but r- the main reason is for fuel you know and and when you read so much information that tells you that meats
and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases
you know [vocalized-noise] like h- heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases it's like uh is it really worth it
and the people i- i really think in general people in the United States just don't eat enough vegetables you know because
you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and and the the the kind that you can't get from a little pill
because your body doesn't doesn't syn- synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know
yeah that's true that's true so you it's it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you
i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um [vocalized-noise] my a- almost everyone in my family is is obese
yeah i- i would say you know th- almost everyone and uh exc- except me except myself and you know my husband but um
and uh yeah i- i
i don't know that my mother and father have seen any improvements since we've been here as far as them switching to meat but do you think you fill healthier mom
sh- my mother says she feels health-
yes
oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook i'm not a really gourmet cook i'm just a normal everyday cook what about you
don't you do you miss meat at all
um-hum
[laughter]
so wh- if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables
yeah
yes but that's
do you eat cheese do you eat li- eggs an
yeah
[laughter] yeah [vocalized-noise]
yeah
but it's becoming more that way i think it's probably easier now to find things
yeah
i don't think i even know what a lentil is
i've heard i've heard of a lentil
uh-huh um-hum
you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook
oh no way
but i bet it's really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat
um i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just wa- you know oh no particular reason i just didn't feel like eating meat and uh i think even after two days i felt different
yeah
yeah
so when you prepare a meal like say on Thanksgiving what do you
[laughter]
yeah
everything but the turkey
[laughter]
yeah
even the turkey yeah that's true
well do they have special cookbooks out for for just vegetarian m- meals you know special books that you
but you don't eat fish either do you
i have a
i have a hard time with vegetables i don't i when i was a kid i didn't like them very much and i never really learned how to cook them
right i guess i don't know
um i'll eat a little bit of broccoli and i'll steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but uh i'm not really good with them and i'll go sometimes and not even fix them i mean i'll have everything else and no vegetable that's strange isn't it
[laughter]
yeah
but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to
and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better
[noise]
okay
uh-huh
uh-huh
well why was CNN the on- of course i think Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to broadcast it is that not true
it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage
yeah
well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other y- i mean what's the other one [vocalized-noise] uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN
uh-huh that's the only thing they broadcast an- like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week they've been having this uh
a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was
well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh
that [vocalized-noise] was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know
uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing
and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem so we got all fearful
for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it
and so it really made me question as to what how do we know ab- you know uh if the news we're getting is any good
so
[laughter]
yeah
right right
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially TV you know it's [vocalized-noise] uh local news
concentrates on murders and things like that i'm from Dallas
and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really [noise] gets me depressed even to watch it
so then you wake up one morning and you're in war with somebody you don't even [laughter] know about it
so
uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i don't
i don't read newspapers
huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh an interest in
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered
it's stolen before i can get out and get it [laughter]
you'd be surprised
they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV you know [vocalized-noise] uh
selections of the day i don't know it just wouldn't be there whenever i've tried it
so [laughter] you're right who would steal a newspaper
but they do
what part of California are you from
oh okay
huh you work for TI
huh
yeah
well i boy current events is not a good subject for me [vocalized-noise]
i don't keep up with it that often
this is your first call
uh-huh
oh really
yeah well i'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes
so if we've done our three minutes let's just let the conversation end and say bye [laughter] [laughter] nice talking to you too bye-bye
[noise]
uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news
and uh for me that's uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television
as a matter of course so i don't get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good
um
yeah
um
i don't know i guess uh i don't even know why i watch CNN i guess i just wanted more news it's one of the few times i wanted
more news than
CBS
were they
yeah
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
hm
um-hum
right
yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably
don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made
but uh i c- i'm from California and i can remember being in
uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed
you know from anyone else's point of view but they'd get all blown up in the news
uh
um-hum
um-hum yeah
right
oh what newspaper uh do you read in Dallas
don't you how come
huh
Go- that's uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper
hm
i see
yeah
yeah
uh from Los Angeles
but i live in Raleigh North Carolina right now that's where i'm speaking to you from
but i grew up in LA
i work out here
no i don't i work for North Carolina State University
but uh i know some people at TI and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them so i'm in the computer business
well
let's see i've i've i've never done this before i mean i've never [noise]
this is my first call because i just got my password
so i don't know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you're supposed to talk for three minutes but i think we've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted
i see
uh-huh
well all right nice talking to you
all right bye
[noise]
[noise] hello hey how you doing
Fernando
wait let me turn off my stereo here
because i've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah
right what time is it over th- are you are you in Dallas
are you
because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas
yeah i'm in North Carolina
on the other coast [laughter]
what yeah yeah it's uh i'm watching Saturday Night Live here
w- wait wh- what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing
wh- what are you working on
really i'm doing my Master's in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering
at North Carolina State University
uh i don't because uh
i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i i'm in Raleigh and
yeah that area and it's really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill
yeah
where are you at
oh okay so so i mean it's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it
yeah
oh okay
so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley
oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley
and they're asking like for a um [vocalized-noise] GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like they're looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it's like
yeah i know that's why that's why i didn't apply i mean it was like
for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part
yeah
so are are you going to go for your doctorate
yeah
when do you get out
oh okay [laughter]
but uh but what if they pay for it
[noise] what if they pay for
yeah
because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um
i think i think they're military but i mean the guy is still in
and um h- uh he works over in Maryland
and so he's doing his Master's here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and he's doing it in like in a year and a summer
and so he's getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that's why you want to join
but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your you know Master's
they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so
yeah
but i mean i mean you the once you get your Master's you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year
and
and that's not what they're paying
yeah yeah i know
yeah
but that's uh
yeah
it's uh it's like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points
and uh everyone's a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money
you know it's like no i- i mean IBM is like there's a joke about IBM which says you know it's like
uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right
and so IBM says well we have t- we have to have a team right
and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right
so he goes have you come up with a -lution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower [laughter] you know it's like everyone's a manager but you know it's like only use like one person does the work so
yeah so
yeah that well that's the way it works i mean that's that's why they're having problems i mean everyone's a manager and
yeah i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there
are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank
you know like all these people are just standing s- s- sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go what's that this track
which it's going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
and so it's like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
yeah
and it fails and you're dead
yeah well IBM doesn't fire anybody
because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job
which y- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit
i mean that's their policy they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally
yeah like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
but they won't let you off what they'll do is like
suppose you know like you're a manager so they'll put you into
keeping up the paper you know it's like how much paper is going in
and then you say that's not my job so you quit
right
right
right
no but i mean it's like it's like
they they have like this different policy i don't know my dad works for them but it's like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it's like
they won't say
yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it
and so that's what you're gonna go for [noise]
and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge
what
th- they made like uh small personal computers
i don't know i- i don't know but what they do is
what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away
and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away
yeah bec- so is it like for example you test a chip
it can't last seven years but it can last five
IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you
and so that's i mean they're still around i think [noise]
so that's what that's what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they [vocalized-noise] that's why they're so compatible
because i mean and by the time you have a computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway
you know
[vocalized-noise] well i mean there's like
when when you realize [vocalized-noise] tea- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know it's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff [noise]
and he got that he said you know it's like um
i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
and i want more you know and it's like
Jesus Christ you know it's like why do you want more because it's like one second
of recording i mean you put into a Wave
and you want to correct the errors in the Wave
takes so much i mean it's like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by Markov model
and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot
imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know it's like [laughter] Jesus Christ
yeah yeah
yeah
well like they say like nobody can get enough you know it's like
once you have something and it's like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right
and they were showing this like Three D g- Three D graphics view of like
what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you
[noise]
hello
not bad not bad What's your name
Fernando my name is Nick
sure
really
[noise]
man am i
no no i'm in Detroit or not Detroit i'm in uh California
yeah i
really
oh well you're on the uh lets see
yeah twenty one
yeah shoot man it's what midnight almost
yeah okay all right well i guess we're supposed to talk what about credit card
oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and
a a Master's in uh information systems
yeah where at
hey how do you like it out there
yeah
[vocalized-noise] Raleigh Durham yeah
uh-huh
yeah so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there
uh well i'm in Monterey California right now
yeah
two hundred fifty
okay it it's it's a lot bigger than Monterey is but we're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco
and it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city
no no i go to the it's the Naval Postgraduate school out here
[noise]
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
well that's what they look for whether or not they get it it's hard to say [noise]
yeah
yeah it's pretty tough it's pretty tough i mean uh let's face it you know and you know are you [vocalized-noise] did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know it's what you do
you know so uh i don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that
probably not see i'm in the Navy
and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably won't do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy
oh probably be another twelve years
oh you know i like what i'm doing right now
excuse me
if they pay for a PhD
nah they won't pay for it they've i think they have maybe two people a year go [vocalized-noise] get their PhD
yeah they civilians or uh military
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps peo- that keeps people
you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more
[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]
um-hum
oh easily i'm sure
no well it depends on what rank you are of course
well i mean like i say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year
yeah those are few and far between though
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah i imagine it's really competitive
um-hum
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
too many chiefs and not enough Indians
yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down
yeah
i didn't realize that
[noise]
um-hum
yeah push paper around
uh-huh
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah they've got a they've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market
and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you y- you probably won't get fired for getting IBM material where's if you try something different
they'll they'll say yeah why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline
[noise]
no
um-hum
uh
i- illegal or something like that yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
so in other words that's the way they force people out [noise]
that's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy
but it does- they don't really say that you know you're you're always going to have great career conditions
yeah hey that's kind of sad
no
well they're the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main
um-hum
yeah well you know that's that's a that's a big thing
yeah they are out of Korea right
leading edge don't they [vocalized-noise]
yeah small PCs aren't they're out of Korea right
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
okay
yeah i've seen well i've seen them around anyway you know [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
most people do or they have to anyway
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
that's amazing yeah
well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're gonna require
yeah both [vocalized-noise] both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk mem- disk base
so
well yeah you find out more
yeah
uh-huh
like those hologram deals
like a hologram [noise] just graphics on a on a
okay
[noise]
[noise]
well what d- do you think in terms of uh benefits
absolutely
well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone
when i was much younger it was uh
less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important
i think they have um
a one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the
uh CODA Plan it's
certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if b- maybe in in your instance if if you're started with TI in your
early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
but i
had another career first and then came to TI a little later
so it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation
so i have to find a way to supplement that
i unders- understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world
well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later
uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else
over many many years
i understand that approach that's what that's exactly what's happening in my family [vocalized-noise]
except that mine are a little bit older and and i've shown them the numbers and said
this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there you better make sure that you've got a scholarship
[laughter]
i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them um
i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
[laughter]
well that's fantastic and on whole o- i would say that they're
equal to uh most of our competitors
uh i can see some some potential changes that
probably are are would not cost very much but
might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord
having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that that TI is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak
well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime
and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
uh
and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one
uh
a- as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day
but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate th- uh that's running in each department
well that's for sure
oh i'm sure personalities always come into play uh just in this size of organization
well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know besides
yeah they tend to offer ad- adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh
[vocalized-noise] one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i don't know if you participate in that or not but
isn't it great [laughter]
it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i had never really thought of it that way but i guess that's true i guess that's true i'm still young enough that that uh the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh
you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at TI the end of last month and uh
kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and
you know when you're when you're you know in your i'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh it's i guess now is the time to think about it so
[noise] does TI have a pretty good retirement package do you think
yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
right
uh-huh
it's not gonna be build up quite enough yeah
yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably
the worst investment in the world but i've got money coming out [vocalized-noise] to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and it's probably not a great investment but if i wasn't doing that
the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know y- i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you don't spend it so [laughter] and it's
yeah
do you yeah
do you really not i- i [vocalized-noise] you know i- i debate about whether it's really good or not you know
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true that's very true
we went uh and did a a thing through IBS which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in in Dallas
and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that ev- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh
[noise] they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to it's
[noise] what it costs now is ridiculous what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just
really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fif- between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have
you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so
yeah yeah
is it really yeah
uh-huh
that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and
and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship
to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it you know
so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it
oh goodness
yeah
yeah exactly exactly
that's right that's right [laughter]
well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have
you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know ind- privately owned [vocalized-noise] owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it
when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased
yeah
think so
um-hum
yeah
yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah
right that sounds really good i read a thing i don't even remember if it was in the Dallas Site or the Inside one about uh
companies allowing you and they said that TI was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week
then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and they're deducting it all along so
you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know you- you're really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know
so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so
um-hum
um-hum
well true true
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and
you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know
there it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you're going to get and what you're not going to get so [noise]
which is the same but but then it's probably that way anywhere you know that's
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number
yes
yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing
and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know get into the system
um-hum yes th-
that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally
i think i would be [laughter] you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that
i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not
oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money
yeah
yes
yes um-hum
yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is
i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it
oh absolutely
th-
that's right
[noise] not with me personally it is with a lot of people
it's not not to me personally no
no
um-hum
yes
that's a it's a tough tough question it really is
yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes
but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do
yes they're only i was reading something about it the o- day i i wanna [vocalized-noise] think there's only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still
a lot of them had to have el- elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's
life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it bu-
i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment
oh yeah
yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else
yes
uh-huh yes
[noise] right the first appeal is automatic so
that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh [noise]
things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing
yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution
yes it certainly does
yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection
yes absolutely
it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say
you know yes or no i would say you know yes i- i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes
no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know
some sort of determent deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless
this may s- seem to be the best way out i don't know
easiest way out maybe
no i don't think it's a monetary thing
yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy
yes absolutely
yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does
yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not
yes
so have we been very very fortunate
that's right absolutely
um-hum
absolutely
uh-huh that's right
yeah
so would i- i fortunately never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else
um-hum
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is
yes
so would i
yes absolutely
it is it's a tough subject it really is
right
that's right
well thank you it's nice talking to you uh-huh bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i am new to Texas so i don't even know what the law is in the state do you
oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper
um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just [noise]
um-hum hum
well
yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there
[noise]
are going to be killed [noise] um there's people that come to the prisons and [noise]
and um-hum they're very violent and they want i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed and i just i can't see that
[noise]
uh-huh
no
well there is so many chances for appeal that it kee-
yeah it's really sad i don't know i just think um
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know
[noise] is really kind of bad and
hum
that's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and ne- never have any chance for
[vocalized-noise] oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue
[noise]
um-hum
hum
i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently
do you think most states have that or
um-hum hum
that still does it that's right
um-hum
have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed
um-hum
[noise] so seems like a lot of people live there and then
through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
if it finally gets to that point
yeah
um-hum
so is it uh [noise] are we doing lethal injection now
um-hum wh- which seems so awful
so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is
[laughter]
yes the other one just seems so terrible
hum
well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
um-hum
hum
yes
hum
well um i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area [noise] it's
and it's kind of been scary to think about it and
you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
you hate to have the dubious honor of being
you know so high in the
in statistics
but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had [noise]
any crime
and so we don't
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way
and how they would expect how they would
hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it
so maybe you would
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
no [laughter] i know when um we just we moved here um i from the
i got a summons jury summons just
like constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that
i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything
that would be really awful
well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh [laughter] talking about this although it has been difficult but uh
i'd hate to decide it but i guess um
guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do
anyway well you have a good day
thank you bye-bye
[noise]
okay the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending [noise] a year or two in in public service
yeah
[noise]
um-hum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local
uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year
that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education
and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think
possibly what uh they're thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where we're sending people off shore [vocalized-noise]
hum
yeah i don't i don't know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that
did you ever get any information on it like
that's that's what i was wondering about was whether they actually
yeah was it
yeah wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps or some such thing [laughter]
where they couldn't do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i don't know which end though yeah [laughter]
yeah yeah that's that's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know
you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey that's not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime
uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and
in pub- yeah [vocalized-noise] and this sort of thing you know so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes
yeah [noise] well i guess that's uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway the uh uh the the public service thing again i- i- i
i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here [laughter] uh
i- i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh
[vocalized-noise] or it can be
you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club
[noise] and uh but if
you know if you start
yeah
yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do shoot them put them in jail
yeah
yeah yeah right
yeah
i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh CCC during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the
the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps he because he was in it he thought that was great the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great
um-hum
um-hum
yeah [noise]
yeah the only
well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do
you know if uh
you know if it's run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect
and [noise] the only opposition to it really was that it was you know s- starting some sort of a military elitist type
you know special corps of uh cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics of it get real confusing
uh
um-hum
[noise] yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well
if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing
oh yeah suppose uh
well you know they they had a group of people who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh [laughter] can't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything
you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here
yeah
yeah i think uh
[noise]
oh boy [laughter]
it's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea it's like a
joke i heard once about uh
elephant foot soup you know it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot
it's it's uh it's the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah it's it's it's just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who
who's going to run it you know what how oh it's just so many
yeah well like like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in Central America my daughter-in-law is Panamanian you know and they have situations like like that down there where they
they have these the social
in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did they'd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places
and when they came back they'd have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn't do anything
and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross
it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very s- it was very slim and so
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
okay then that's uh kind of [vocalized-noise] a private
organiz- you know i'm i'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a
was a Mormon he was because he was a good construction uh you know in- instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate that's off the subject no i haven't s- i haven't seen
you know
um-hum
i seen how they were organized in in central and South America and uh yeah it's uh
okay
i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea
seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn [vocalized-noise] something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so
hum
um-hum
oh really uh
um-hum um
yeah
i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and
but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then may- maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to
really you know
send children you know to do that
i didn't know
yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea
i sent off for stuff on it but i don't remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um
yeah
you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasn't much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered
yeah i think so yeah yeah [laughter]
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a certain age and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them and
to some other country that had different moral values something like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink [laughter]
really [laughter] yeah i hadn't thought about that um-hum
yeah
public hangings and yeah
yeah
yeah i've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that
might not go if it was voluntary but i don't know how they'd enforce it if it was
yeah i don't know send them over to Iraq [laughter] have a vacation in Iraq for a year [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the
things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too
i don't know
[noise] i'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and [laughter] mow the grass and [laughter]
yeah yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and
leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or
it would be open for
yeah that could be a complicated too couldn't it yeah
yeah that's true unfair or something yeah yeah
[laughter]
[noise] yeah really
yeah well it seems like there's there's a a lot of you don't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have
good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh
the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she's practically a teenager [laughter]
she started some type of um [noise] national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards
[noise] you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um
[noise] minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said ever- all these gangs kids could join to belong
but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are
willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know
if their willing to do it
yeah
yeah
hum
um-hum
huh
oh i see
yeah
yeah yeah
well we um we belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the nickname the Mormon church
and um the there is men and also women women aren't
um nearly as frequent and also that have uh elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission
and um they're all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language and
customs and all those kinds of things and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months
[noise] right
oh [laughter] he had a direct connection somewhere uh [laughter]
[noise] yeah
yeah but see they don't get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes they're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some but
but you know that it is incredible
y- you know
[vocalized-noise] yeah it's
very involved
[noise]
[laughter] what are you afraid of with them
yes
[laughter]
well that's very can be very very true
well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and
absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest
i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right
that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they
oh boy those are two very active ages
uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines
[laughter]
well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
yeah right absolutely because they figure that [noise] that's correct [laughter] the idea is to use their money
[laughter]
and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month
um-hum
right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted
well i-
and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word
[laughter] i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
that much spent right
well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you
[noise]
right well take good care take care of your little ones uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well um with credit cards is me i i try to keep maybe just one or two i don't i don't like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just don't like them [laughter]
what am i afraid of um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much i just uh don't think that i need them you know i uh
they are tempting at times but i i just you know
sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so
so and there you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so
yeah
uh-huh
that's right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not
that's right uh-huh
uh-huh
that's what i do
that's what i do just a sec- Whitney
i will i'm on the phone honey
sorry
i have two little ones yeah yeah so but always want some [vocalized-noise] um four and two and a half
yes uh yeah i'm i'm like you i i use my only use my credit card for um
you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check and then but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month
so
no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number [laughter]
uh-huh that's right see we he couldn't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing
yeah
uh-huh
you're right and that's kind of silly
yeah your defeating the purpose
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i
yeah
yeah it's like
i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved
yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think
[laughter]
so
yeah
uh-huh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find
wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it
uh-huh
yeah it does because you're you know [vocalized-noise] you're you know you're just co- costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again so yeah
yes it's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck bye-bye
[noise]
okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy
[laughter]
yeah
oh you do want a lot of that stuff
what kind of uh
things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the
well what do you call them you said amenities
that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price
it is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem [laughter]
yeah
yeah
well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um
several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be
because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new
you know we bought the car new and after [noise] um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when
brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable
yeah so that was that was kind of a shock
[laughter]
yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh
um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable
you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes
especially not after two years
really oh i don't know
um-hum
yeah
what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at
um-hum
how come [vocalized-noise] i've been kind of um
i guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all
i think they have a really good um quality
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
they seem to be really durable
so i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to
to stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more
what i would consider to be a long-term investment
[laughter]
oh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage
um-hum
i think so
[laughter]
all righty thanks bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh
i really don't know the answer um
i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type
sporty one but um
[noise] something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things
[noise]
yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy
amenities
um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration
but
yeah
[laughter]
well that's that's a big one in my book but uh um
i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others
um and i would sort of like to buy American
but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you
oh really
um-hum
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah i wouldn't have thought so either
oh
yeah i- i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision
right
no but then um
no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune
[noise]
yeah i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and
even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too to own them
[noise] well i haven't rea- really gotten that far with it um i've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh
oh i guess i really don't know
yeah
yeah that i think that's
um-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh
you know we've had some work done on them but it's not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um
bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it
and you knew it had had been through a whole lot
and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so
i thought they would
yeah
yeah
well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you
yeah
yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for
some of the foreign ones
well
we talked long enough [laughter]
[laughter] okay well enjoyed it bye-bye
[noise]
well uh the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts
and uh i've been involved in making uh hat stand and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with um
flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff
and i enjoy it it's relaxing
and you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by you know before you realize anything's going on
and i play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction [laughter] not for anybody else's ears because i'm not that good at it but i like to bang the keyboards once in a while how about yourself
really
oh yeah that's neat
oh that's great
uh-huh
oh that sounds nice i like bluegrass too
uh-huh
[laughter] that's the hard part right
if you can do things together that really helps a lot
oh well that's good too
uh-huh
oh it's good and it's healthy too
we do that too we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know yeah and we like movies
[vocalized-noise] yeah
uh-huh

oh yeah that's great too
uh-huh
yeah we did some remodeling when we bought a house we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering that's fun it is it really is
yep exactly i like things that uh you know two people can do but i like the quiet of doing things away you know kind of gives you some space for yourself
and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create and i like to crochet and knit i made some afghans and that kind of stuff i like doing things with my hands
that yeah [noise]
yes i love to cook
Italian food [laughter] yeah pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff

and uh worked in the Abilene plant and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue and oh that was great
really great they have some nice stuff down there
i miss it [laughter]
oh yeah
oh we did hor- i- i did horseback riding too in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses
and uh that was kind of for them but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know
so uh [noise] that was [vocalized-noise] a real i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know we always had horses around and i really enjoyed that
and i was disappointed when i went to Texas i didn't see that many of them yes [laughter]
i know i know it's true
uh-huh
yeah you too you too
okay
me too
okay bye now
[noise]
alrighty uh i'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today
hm
oh really
well [noise] oh hobbies gee whiz i guess i got too many hobbies so i never have time to deal with them i like photography a lot uh
i used to do that a lot and then i like um [noise] we have a new child that'll be a year old here next week so i'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them first one you know how that is and um [noise] uh
i play the guitar and a banjo i mainly play the guitar a lot you know i play it about every night [noise]
and um i really love that if i had a druther if i could've if i could make it on the road i'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something because that's
i've yeah i've done it before and when i was in h- in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it and and it's really a a blast my wife hates it but that's the way life is i guess
exactly
uh the well yeah we uh she's uh into the aerobics and uh
an- and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half and that went over real well but uh that's about it there
oh yeah yeah
oh that's great
that's great
yep that's uh spare time with a child it's kind of stre- she's we have uh we're looking for a baby sitter so we've been out twice in o- in this year so far by ourselves without the child so it's kind of
uh become an issue you could say [noise] um hobbies i like
messing around in your house building things and you know put cabinets up and those kind of things um
it's really kind of fun
especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty yeah
[noise] uh-huh sounds like it [noise] do you like to cook
yeah i love to cook too i'm a
oh really
well we're all skinny farts so i it [vocalized-noise] so when it comes [vocalized-noise] i like to
cook and eat and to have m- mainly i guess i get the enjoyment out of people eating it and saying man this is really good um
um but it it just
work in the garden work around the yard o- course
yes w- we sure do smoke them and
oh yeah all that hoe down stuff yeah all that stuff that's bad for you
oh sure yeah
oh yeah
that's uh only way to do it
well yeah it's uh it's uh it's uh there's uh there's pluses to everything but yeah it seems like there's just so many things to do down here i like the sports side i play a lot of racquetball
[laughter]
[noise] oh that's great sound like you
horses yeah you really don't yeah th- there's a you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh
there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here and it's uh yeah but uh that's great well sound like you have a lot of nice hobbies there
well great well look uh i know it's probably late for you uh enjoyed speaking with you have a good weekend bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay i don't know which end do we [noise] push but okay [vocalized-noise]
right
yeah
that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type [vocalized-noise] followers the guys that uh
you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vo- R- vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent
you know are the ones that don't uh don't really
uh show up every year because they can't seem to
to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
yeah
yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but [laughter] that didn't work
um-hum
yeah yeah that's uh
and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes [laughter]
i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know
yeah well that uh that's so- i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a pr- pr- predominately Catholic type area
and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspir- inspired you know and uh
still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh
you know it's it's women's rights and the a- and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones
but uh
yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the
the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh
the pressure that lobbyists can put
well
[noise]
right
yeah
yeah well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected
uh
uh-huh
unfortunately that'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even mo- uh turnout even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out
they'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years
uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with i- with
old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh
you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come ou- turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and -ve seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever
but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years
um-hum
yeah wonder if they're going to take into account with this commutiv uh this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking [laughter]
no i can't hear them
oh yeah
yeah
uh Washington DC um-hum
oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then
no huh-uh
uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh we're communications i w- i work in a communications company
yeah
[laughter]
yeah we sort of different
they called me at uh ten o'clock one night that was very strange
i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i
yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
okay
yeah okay well if you're ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay
oh
okay
yeah yeah yeah so do we
yeah right next to Dulles all right well i'll talk to you later bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and
you know there's such a
small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and
that you know their vo- votes not going to make that much difference
and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person
is going to have a lot of uh since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them so
it'd be really difficult to have that one pers- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed
hum
yeah
right yeah that's good
yeah
yeah there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um
the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded
as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things
but
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's that's true i think in uh the Texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time
oh really
right
um-hum
yeah that's true
and uh
yeah that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place
um-hum
right
yeah and it's uh
real true that uh
y- you know they'll say one thing
to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand
you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh
with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to
even try to do
right
right after the war
that really uh
uh that's true
yeah
right yeah
um-hum
right that's right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact and uh that's true they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true
because you know that's what the media says well the majority believes this way so
uh they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions
so that's that's true
[laughter]
yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay they're
the children next door just opened the fence and they went off yeah but anyway that's i guess we've uh talked long enough and that was sort of interesting what part of the country are you from
are you really wow this is i'm in from this is Dallas where i'm at the outskirts of Dallas
yeah do do you work for TI in any way
wow how did you how did they get you or
oh
oh okay right i work for TI so
we saw it on the uh the T- News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting
yeah
well
yeah
yeah Central Standard Time's what they're doing it by
yeah
i still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but
i didn't study it that hard so maybe i'll figure it out
but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic
[laughter]
okay i'm i'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport
oh okay
yeah
okay bye
[noise]
here goes Sharon
[noise] well [noise] what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars
that's the only thing i found out tonight
yeah
yeah
well isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would
wonder because football
and a lot more games right
uh-huh
beats me i mean i know Yankees have won a lot of games through the years
[laughter] we have been talking about this i tried to call earlier
and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from then i started cleaning and i don't know where i even put that paper i yeah i was just cleaning and throwing
well have you ever played baseball
well that's what i did when i was growing up
that was fun
uh-huh
do you ever go see the Rangers

[vocalized-noise]
yeah it's nice at night
that's when i've been
[noise]

[noise]
oh yeah see you just
[noise] well they're trying
uh-huh
kind of right

for right now i'm trying to get out
[noise] uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh i mean it's good because they they try new things you know but it's like
they'll try something and then they throw it out and get something else you know and you get tired of that
[noise]
yeah
well but they can't be though they don't have as much money
most the time
oh man but in Dallas you don't even know who's in in administration there's so many of them
[laughter] i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you don't know what they're there for you know when they're coming how long they're going to be
you know it's just them there they are and they're writing the whole time
[noise] no i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything and i finally got to where i go okay i'm Debbie Moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for
you know because you know you never know where they're going [laughter] what they'll report or
[vocalized-noise] and they'll tell you they've written something down and you
hope they're telling you [laughter]
[laughter]
no huh-uh
oh it is
uh this is my eleventh year
[noise] no actually it's now my job's
good much better than a lot
because i'm Chapter One and all i do is teach reading all day long
and it's just ten children at a time
no it's good and you've got a lot of federal money too
teaching [noise] oh yes
yes when i first started teaching i remember i went up to my job and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know so i'll know what i'm suppose to teach and they go
we don't have one of we don't even know where one is
and [noise] i go okay i mean you just you did what you [laughter] wanted to do
and now they tell you what to teach and how long and
you know what day
what period
yeah no i know which is worse
[laughter]
[laughter] um-hum [noise]
well you can talk for ten minutes but you don't have to
yeah and no if you talk to ten then they come ov- on and say oh you've extended your limit and please say good-bye within the next five seconds
well you know i hadn't either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio we started talking about gangs you know
yeah
and everybody else that i've talked to has been right around here
but she was real interesting
and then tonight this woman called have you taken any incoming calls
okay so hers was the first one i got
gotten and uh
oh she was telling me all her problems
and it went over ten minutes
well yeah we did but the topic was boring i thought what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party
oh yeah i could go on and on about that
ooh neat
no
the last one i saw was Dances Of The With The Wolves Of The Wolves
oh i enjoyed it i mean it was just more for my money
huh
uh-huh
one is eight and one is eleven
they usually pick their own
you know they've got it all figured out
well and Ninja Turtles
but most of the time really we watch them on the video
don't you just massive rental
going to
i know
that's what we do especially when it's bad weather man just
plug it in
i know
it's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they're cheap and nobody's got them yet unbelievable
uh-huh
do you read
no
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night
you saw Field Of the Dreams right a long time ago
so i was reading the book and it's called Shoeless Joe
it was so wonderful and then i was um i decided well i like this author so i got a uh book of his short stories and that's been real good
don't don't ask me [laughter] The Ghost Of Shoeless Joe was the name of the book
yes quite a quite a bit but you know in the movie the guy was black
he wasn't in the book
that's one difference
there really wasn't a lot of difference
um-hum
so
well do you think we've covered baseball
[noise] okay well have a good n-
okay
oh you found that out tonight i hadn't even heard that that's great i think he deserves every penny of it
but there are some others out there that i don't believe deserve the money they're getting
oh yeah
and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too
yep that's exactly right
but i think let's see the teams that were there last year were
see somebody from California i don't even know who won the pennant last year
yeah [laughter] not lately though [laughter]
uh-huh
threw it away [laughter] oh gosh let's see the teams that [vocalized-noise] i think the A's were in it last year the Oakland A's and i think it was
i don't think it was an all California baseball
i play softball
yeah
yeah that's fun [laughter] that's a whole different sport
yeah
let's see but i think i think the Rangers need to go and i think the Pirates will go
and uh
let's see
Rangers have got a new guy this year i don't remember his name either
every once in a while i- i like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there it's a lot more fun when you're not fighting a crowd
yeah but sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun
yeah
it is
and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there
yeah that that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there
of course
that's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play
and they're never going to let liquor in there
i know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out
it's so stupid because they let you take it in there but they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there
but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice and i heard that there's uh
that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you
it's going to it's going to go to the highest bidder [laughter]
[laughter]
so
yeah so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame
oh
oh God [laughter] i stay away from them
[laughter] i bet you do
in Plano
oh you are
oh what's he teach
uh-huh
so what do you do
oh you do
is that a tough system to be in
real hard
yeah i would think it
yeah
that's typical bureaucracy though that's that's i think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i don't know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad
yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes
[laughter] you don't even know who to payoff huh [laughter]
yeah
oh how funny
no communication whatsoever
[laughter]
yeah
i know
and you haven't you and you never see it
[noise] that's got to be frustrating
how long have you taught taught Dallas schools
ooh that's about uh ten too many [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh
well that's not bad
but hasn't it changed a lot over the years
yeah
or working in the system
[laughter]
oh God
oh
how funny
yeah you don't know which is you don't know which is worse
yeah i guess so yeah being told what to do is worse
so how long are we suppose to talk for
oh you can
oh i haven't ever talked that long [laughter]
oh how funny
he lives in Cleveland
wow
yeah
huh
the yours is my second one
[laughter]
did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all
oh
oh gosh
[laughter]
what was i'm trying to remember oh the other the one i talked about the other night was good it was
um about movies you know who what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that
me too because we go all the time the guy i was talking to never goes he was boy it sounds like your really up on this and i said i see at least two a week [laughter] so
that was real good to talk about that have you seen like uh Silence Of The Lambs
you've got to go see that
yeah we talked about that one too and he he said he didn't think it should of gotten all those awards he thought it was too long but
i
i did too
yeah i didn't think it was too long at all
um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch
the other one you need to go see is Sleeping With The Enemy
and how old are your kids
you probably don't want to take them to see Silence Of The Lambs
it's it's not it's not too cool for kids [laughter]
i bet they do
yeah they want to see all the horror movies
yeah Ninja Turtles got to have those
oh yeah you bring that's well heck that's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all at one nigh- one time
yeah
of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything
decent
well
that's true
that's true we saw um
Heroes Has Always Been Cowboys tonight
it was okay it was kind of slow and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know
it just it and i don't know it one of those movies it's not going to be around long it'll be a dollar movie in no time
not very much no
i don't have the patience to read [laughter]
yeah oh my mom and dad read all the time
yeah sure did
oh really
who's the who's the author
oh [laughter]
[laughter]
Shoeless Joe was it like the movie
okay
right
huh
i didn't uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie
that's interesting
that was a good movie too
i think so [laughter]
[noise] okay i'll let you start first okay [laughter]
well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it
so it took him about two and a half years
but uh he built us a house
it's uh we have thirty two hundred square feet
and it's a brick house
and pricewise it wasn't great because he did it all hisself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it
and um we live in kind of a small town
and i mean it's nothing fancy you know it's it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it
oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else
you know
so but uh of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us
and that helped a- and uh yes and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else
we've been in it six years
n- no we- well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don't need such a large house
that we'll sell it but he will not build a second one himself [laughter] because he says agewise he'll never be able to handle that again yes yes
um
uh-huh
yeah oh
uh-huh
yes
but uh like i said otherwise you know a th- the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourself
yeah i mean it's not a Eldorado house or anything like that but you know it's ours [laughter]
that's right that's right
a- apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high [laughter] isn't it it really is
because i i'm always shocked at about you know what they've g- have it appraised at i think oh my goodness
okay and it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye
[noise]
okay we um i'm presently living in a house uh first time uh
we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh [noise]
um it was a really excitement to uh
[noise]
to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses
and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home
and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart
so i would um
not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced
um but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and um you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting
uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it
[noise] how about in your case
um-hum
um-hum
well that's great that's great that's uh i've heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh
who had a house built [vocalized-noise] matter of fact another guy's building one now he's been doing it for three years and the city's a little upset with him but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh
nothing wrong with that uh i'll vouch for that
um
that was a big savings
well that's great we- have you been in it long
oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward
[laughter] i see well
first one's always a bear
we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any coun- you know so that's kind of the
we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he's r- certified and registered so at least we know we're it's not gonna fall in or something if it's built but uh i have heard
that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and that's kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh i've
i file in my little book and do other things with it uh that's great that's great
sure i can imagine
if your happy with it that's all that counts
that's o- only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else
ooh and that's uh that's uh a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess
a lot of money i bet well that's great [noise] well [noise] yeah i guess that about does it
nice talking with you too bye [noise]
[noise]
okay uh
well yeah i like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and stuff i just bought a home two years ago that's about sixty five years old and we've done a little work on it
and uh about
pardon me
timber framing okay well
other than you talking about like post and beam construction that type well not very much other than what i read we don't use much of that up here although i understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit
but um
up here we generally use uh uh frame construction work or wood frame construction with wooden siding and and you know most of your homes down south i guess are brick
but here they're pretty much wood frame construction on a two by four's and and uh one by twelve boarding on the outside or sheet plywood
and then some kind of a insulation material and covered with clapboards or shingles
that's a typical New England home i guess
ah
sure
um-hum
oh okay that's unique we do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are they're again they're
they're truss construction but they're well braced you know cross braced inside held together by steel cleats and stuff
uh mansard roofs are are in bond building i guess are
they do a lot of that
i understand by laminating the series of of beams of planks together and and with
um-hum
well that's something
sure sure something like the way you'd do uh um bricks around a window around a large window type thing the center the center brick is the key brick which locks everything together that's a pretty neat idea
you building are you are y- [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
okay
where are you located
okay
yeah okay i lived in Abilene for about ten years
oh yeah a little bit [laughter]
it gets a little dusty there Lubbock blows by there about once a month if i remember [laughter]
i worked for the TI plant in Abilene and and i sure enjoyed the Southwest it was really neat
but uh that that's an interesting concept that is this going to be your your permanent home or okay
i saw a log cabin built down there that i was really impressed with and it sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms
but the rest of the center portion of the cabin which was a huge huge house was all open and the thing i really liked about it was it had a porch on all four sides of the house
all the way around the house
uh-huh
yeah yeah
uh-huh
wow boy that's quite a distance
yeah yeah i have a a pretty good idea where it is of course i know Wichita Falls pretty well
pardon me
yeah
uh-huh well that's really interesting
yeah well out out that way it shouldn't be to bad i guess your traffic doesn't get too heavy till you head in toward uh toward Dallas a little bit but you should spread out pretty good out there i know
yeah out in West Texas there was hardly any at all in Abilene but
uh well with that's a little different here in New England we sure got some around Boston here and New York i'll tell you but [laughter]
oh
oh okay yeah well i live about i live just over the line of south of Attleboro Massachusetts into Rhode Island
and it's just north of the City of Providence
about forty miles from Boston but the traffic on the interstate every day back and forth to work it it's it's an eye opener [laughter]
but it moves pretty well so
well boy it's sure been nice talking with you and uh uh hopefully we'll have another conversation probably another way down the road good luck with your new home
is that right
okay [vocalized-noise] and and
sure
uh-huh
you going to take advantage of the uh the ground thermal action and and and and uh use that for your heat and cooling
for cooling especially yeah yeah yeah well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes but
yeah that's for sure [laughter] uh well we're still in our winter up here right now the temperature is eighteen degrees [laughter]
[noise]
yeah huh [laughter] i can stand that
yeah well it's been cold up here the mornings have been cold the winds blowing about forty miles an hour right now so it's really really cold outside
we've been real fortunate we haven't had much snow and stuff so
[noise]
is that right
yeah that's but that's a little too much though then a lot of folks catch colds and stuff that you know
the the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a little more gradual i think
yeah yeah i i hear you [laughter]
okay sir
it yeah yeah thank you much i will talk to you again bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
so you're a woodworker uh
what do you know about timber framing
what do you know about timber framing
right right
uh-huh
yeah the reason i asked is because
we're embarking on a little adventure here
in that we're going to use uh some timber framing techniques to build a
a truss for a home
and it's a it's a you know what a mansard roof is
like a barn yeah
and they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing
so the whole area is like a cathedral up there
for the second floor
right
um-hum
yeah that that's done some where they're actually create a a single piece that is the trust
but uh what i want to do is i want to make four identical components
and uh cut the joints so that the
the more pressure you put on it the stronger it gets
and it involves interleaving and uh using uh you know locking wedges
yeah similar to that yeah
well if i do that and then cover it with uh two by six tongue and groove
it will be pretty sturdy because we have to we we got what we call Santa Ana wind down here
it comes up out of Mexico at about a hundred miles an hour
we're at a the cor- at the Northwest of Denton Texas
right on the Red River
yeah well then you know about that wind
[laughter]
yeah
yeah yeah we we bought this land out here we're going to we're going to retire on it
maybe in twenty five thirty years from now but
you know we're we're still fairly young
well we're only going to have a porch on north and south end
and uh we'll have so- uh Anderson window walls is what they are
so the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass
because on the piece of property we have it's the second highest pointed in the county
and we can see Oklahoma to the north the lights of Gainesville to the east and the lights of Wichita Falls to the west
and that's a and it's it's a we're just right on the southern rim of the Red River Valley
well you know where Nocona is
Nocona
okay that's about as far north as we can see just you know right on the other side of the river there
and boy it's really nice it's about an hour drive to work though
we don't have any traffic
[laughter]
yeah
well i used to live in uh Springfield well actually Chicopee Falls
that's unbelievable
yeah it will be a lot of fun we're digging the foundation by hand
yeah the first floor's going to be underground
and it of course it will be open on the south and north end
and east and well see we have a little knoll on our property about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up so we'll nestle the house right up next to it
right
cooling we don't have to worry about heat i mean
yeah but they're very short
[laughter]
well the temperature Tuesday was ninety six [laughter]
it was tough today it was cold in the seventies
[noise]
it went from thirty eight to ninety six on Tuesday that's a pretty good temperature swing
well if you don't like the weather in Texas just wait a minute
well you have a good day
all righty
[noise]
[noise]
okay what do you feel is contributing most to air pollution
cars you think so
uh-huh
yeah i i would have figured that some of the factories may be contributing as much as as uh automobiles
um-hum
um-hum
well if you only have to get your car in inspected once a year you can just go have it fixed real quick right before the inspection
and and a lot of when you a lot of places when you go get the inspection they just pull it out of the garage and then pull it back in and they don't really check anything they just make sure the lights work basically
have they
um-hum
oh gosh
yeah that'll help
less people driving and more peo- you know more people riding in one car rather than everybody riding to work by themselves will help a little bit and if if everyone car pooled that would cut it down in half
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well uh in uh San Antonio the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park it costs seventy five dollars a month just to park my car
so i ride with two other uh girls
so that way it will only costs me twenty five dollars a month to park but it's just crazy and it's from what i understand i know a girl in Washington DC and it costs her a couple of hundred dollars a month to park her car
yeah and from what i understand New York City is worse that it just costs a fortune to own a car in New York City
hum-um
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah uh once you're in downtown San Antonio it's real easy to get around they have a they have these uh buses that that look like little street cars
and they go all around that it's just real easy to get around once you're downtown the problem is getting downtown and they have some uh Park and Ride uh Express is where you go to the the bus stop and you get on the bus and it takes you directly downtown
but they don't have enough of them and they're not convenient enough
and there just happens to not be one convenient to where i live so if if there were i would ride the bus
oh no not really um
i've noticed once flying into DFW there was just a a brownish orange haze over the city it was the ugliest thing i had ever seen
yeah
this is a nice time of the year though when it's so windy it just seems everything is so fresh
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
well
yeah i guess so
i think it's five and i think we have [laughter]
well it was nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[noise] cars
yeah i really do i because i'm from California originally and so i saw the beginning i feel i saw the beginning of air pollution in the fifties and i think then it was basically from from automobiles i really do
and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and now it's just terrible factories don't help
but we have so much traffic now so many cars you know they're trying to fix it uh with all this emission control and everything but then i still see cars going down the road with all this smoke pouring out of the back end of them
and that infuriates me i always want to tell them you know don't you know what you're doing to our air and i don't understand how they can get their uh how they can get their car inspected and get away with that
yeah
they've really cracked down up here yes uh really [laughter] my neighbor has a uh he has a a fairly new car but
it's an in the eighties it's a Taurus
and he went to get his inspected and there was something about the emissions something that wasn't quite right and they wouldn't pass it and mean there's no smoke or anything comes out of his car it's a nice car
and uh he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet you know the emissions and he went to several places
so so they're starting to crack down
yeah i i really
yes um TI is trying to promote car pooling up here with buses and and trying to get people to ride share and stuff like that
but um i use my car for wor- during the day for the job so it's really hard for me to do that
[noise] but
[vocalized-noise] oh my gosh
oh that's terrible that that make me take the bus
you don't really need one in the city and they have such good um
uh what transit systems you know they've got trains and everything i w- and we really need that
uh Texas is really lacking in transit and i think when they if they would do that and put in trains and stuff that that would really help a lot because people i would much rather take a bus or a train than use my car
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
can you really see pollution down there now
not but see you can see it here i mean you can just see it hanging in the air
yeah that's it
it's terrible it is really terrible
and in the summer time it seems to be worse because it there's no air to blow it out you know it's it's horrible
and all the trees are starting to bloom out and everything yeah
so i just hope it's not too late i hope we've caught all this pollution and stuff hope they're we're just not going to wait until it's too late to do anything we're going to have to live in bubbles
worries me it worries me they should have been doing things that their doing now twenty years ago
you know to stop it
and they really haven't
so well what do we do should we hang up
[laughter]
okay have we reached ten minutes
ok- okay okay okay bye-bye
[noise]
so how do you feel about camping do you do it often
uh-huh
okay where where did you go there
okay
oh that must have been great
yeah i use to live in Colorado and did did some camping up there
yeah
um well the best place we went was uh the great Sand Dunes National Monument
yeah i just love that place i've gone there twice
and uh it's really neat there's all kinds of jeep trails and the the dunes themselves and
it's a lot of fun i like the place
okay near Mesa Verdes
right
okay
yeah
yeah i've done some of that
yeah
yeah
that's great
yeah i've taken about four trips across country i'm originally from the East Coast but i uh took four let's see twice to California and once to and twice to Wyoming
and uh most recently i've just been camping with in North Carolina
and one of the best trips we took in last year we uh a whole bunch of us um packed up all the our gear in sailboats we sailed out to this island on the North Carolina Coast
and it's it's a totally deserted island there's no buildings there at all
it's not it's not really that big it's maybe four or five miles long and a mile across it's like protected water on the one side and the ocean on the other side
and we sailed out there and camped and it was it was really neat
because no one was there
a little bit cold [laughter]
it's pretty it's kind of cold to to camp on the coast
yeah
the wind get's really bad
it's neat to wake up to go for a walk on the beach
i mean most of time when you go to the beach you're at this real tourist trap and all these hotels and stuff and this was just like paradise
you
yeah we had sand pretty much everywhere [laughter]
[noise]
yeah
a lot of sand and having to haul all your all your stuff there in boats was was wasn't um it's more work than a backpacking because you had to worry about stuff getting wet
yes
yeah it rained on us on the way home [laughter]
i remember coming back into the uh port where we left and i had a cooler on my head as my hat and we we wrapped ourselves in garbage bags [laughter]
we were so cold
but uh no one couldn't the last time i went ca- camping was over uh Thanksgiving we went camping up in the Appalachians
uh-huh
okay
and we went and um this place outside of uh Winston-Salem North Carolina and it was really cold [laughter]
camping in in November [laughter]
year
yeah
well North Carolina's fairly warm all year-round it it doesn't get much lower than the thirties but we're up in the when you get up in the mountains it's a little bit different
and uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay
yeah
some of the problem is you need a lot of equipment to do it there's a few things that you just kind of have to have or you can't go camping
depending on what kind of camping your doing like a stove or sleeping bag and a tent and all that
and like for the last couple years i've been borrowing it [laughter] whenever i wanted to go
yeah well that's that's
yeah
yeah
well
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
it makes makes you appreciate uh i guess the conveniences of modern living
[laughter]
yeah
okay
good talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
okay
i haven't in a while but i do enjoy it when i get to go the last time i went camping was um in San Antonio
Texas and uh
um in a park Guadalupe State Park or Guadalupe River State Park
and then i guess before that the last time i went camping was up on backpacking up on the Continental Divide in Colorado yeah for two weeks it was pretty fun [laughter]
oh really where would you go camping
uh-huh i've been there
uh-huh
huh
um i guess in Colorado i'm trying to think of the place we went was in Pagosa Springs
and we went up kind of in the Southwest corner of Colorado
yeah yeah because we went isn't Mesa Verdes where they have the the cliff dwellings okay yeah we went by there and then we went to on to Pagosa Springs [noise]
and wh- that's that's when we got the packs and and you had to put everything for a week on your back [laughter] and there was no showers no nothing for a week it was pretty interesting [laughter]
it was quite an experience and this was in the middle of the summer and we woke up one morning and it snowed for about fifteen minutes
but it didn't last any amount of time
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
uh-huh
well that sounds like fun
uh-huh
[laughter] yeah
yeah i guess the wind and everything uh
yeah uh
i've never camped on the coast before i've always thought it would be fun
uh-huh
right [laughter]
did you get a lot of sand in your sleeping bag and everything though [laughter]
i can imagine [laughter]
sounds like that would be a mess
[laughter]
yeah i guess that's true too
[laughter]
oh gosh
oh no
God [laughter]
um
uh-huh
oh hold on just a moment
[noise]
[noise]
okay i'm on a cordless phone and every now and then i get interference and i have to switch the channel i can hear something weird in the background sorry about that
um
i guess so
i guess it gets pretty cold in that part of country in November i mean here it's pretty unpredictable it could be cold or it could be really warm in that time of the year so
yeah
well it's been i guess the last time i went camping was well probably about two years ago
um i've been wanting to since then i just haven't had much of a chance to a bunch of my friends went and camped up at the at a lake in Oklahoma once this last summer
and i can't remember why i couldn't go ye- oh i was going to South Padre that weekend [laughter]
that was why but um
i really i like to camp i just haven't had much opportunity to do it lately
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i guess really the most times i've been camping would i ha- i would have to say it would be Colorado and New Mexico in that area
just on a big group trip thing and i didn't have to come up with much equipment because a for the group we got all the stuff that we needed
but um
and that was boy that was a while back when i did that actually it's probably been ten years ago [laughter]
but it was quite i just can remember sleeping in this sleeping bag and waking up in the middle of the night just freezing cold i mean i just you couldn't stay warm at night no matter what and i was sleeping on my my down jacket with my pillow and
sleeping in long johns and freezing but during the day it would get nice enough and then after that week of being up there i can remember coming back down to our base camp area at at the lake at Pagosa Springs
and we all made a beeline for this pump because there weren't any there were just outhouses and a pump and we all went to the pump and we were all washing our hair under the pump
and it was so cold it must have been like thirty three degree water that just was all but frozen and it gave us the worse headaches we've ever had in our lives it was so nice just to at least get clean hair and we all jumped in the lake and everything just to just to rinse off
it was quite an experience i've never gone for a whole week in the wilderness with with no you know no running water nothing so it was pretty pretty uh interesting experience
definitely [laughter]
definitely i mean when you appreciate an outhouse you know you've been roughing it [laughter]
but anyway well five minute well actually we've gone more than five minutes so
anyway it was good talking to you Rick all right bye-bye
[noise]
hi how are you doing
i said how are you doing
yeah we've been doing that too [noise] we're trying to retire in our fifties
[noise]
good luck on that one then
i said good luck on that one then
uh-huh
so you work for TI then
you can't say yep
[noise]
yes you do well i work for DISD and i don't know what you're talking about when you say um health insurance but Dallas doesn't pay it pays most of mine
you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know m- i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars
and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point
and benefits you know i'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site ch- child care sometime
i think that would be an excellent idea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their kids were being taken care of they could go visit them during the day
right
well we can shelter also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too you know go on and pay a lump sum
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay but if you paid in more than you actually used
and the same thing for insurance what you predict you're going to be paying for insurance
as long as you pay actually pay out that amount of money you're okay but if you pay out
less then you lose that money
i don't like that part but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to
and then we got that cafeteria plan do you have that
no you can uh
well you let's see it sh- it shelters you're money that you pay for insurance
it takes it out of your salary before taxes
okay
yeah
but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why
i said i wonder why
cafeteria
[laughter]
maybe so let's see what else can we do changes
what
um-hum
you mean like for health insurance
yeah
well that's easier done in a company than it is in uh school teaching
thank you [noise]
i said thank you
we're both school teachers
but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good
it's almost impossible
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
um-hum
right
well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago
you know f- in the public schools
it made you ea- more at ease you know you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous
[noise]
[noise] right
well they don't
in some places they don't
do they
you know
yeah [laughter]
what did you get your degree in
and what's your job now
[noise]
huh
maybe
all right what else could we change
[noise] oh i'd like to see flexible hours and teaching you know shared job sharing
more of that
well see we've got a little bit of it but not much
and it'd be nice if your you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing
what else i'd like to be able to to evaluate your boss
and it really carry some weight and you get to choose your boss
huh
well so you get to evaluate him though why not
no
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
uh i couldn't hear you
i'm doing fine i'm just uh
editing a spreadsheet right now i'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work -til i'm ninety five
[laughter]
yeah thi-
yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because
what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making
[laughter]
what's that
well
we've got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our property's already paid for
you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits
would be the uh [noise] the availability of the health insurance
and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer
around inside the organization
without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of
you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project
yep
what
um-hum
well
yeah that's uh that's something i hadn't really thought about since we don't have children
but i can see how it would be a real benefit
those that do
hum
well that can i can see where that might be important
no
i i don't know what you're talking about there
oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
hum
oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it
[laughter]
i'll tell you what we could do
we could prohibit people from being hired that are
historically going to cost the company money
you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
because you know i-
well no- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company
see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company
and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find
a a place to put them or b you know boot them out
well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
what
oh well
i'm i'm
i know
well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor
i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that
but
once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation
then you have tenure
and they can't fire you
well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs
but in addition
um-hum
well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that
but uh what i'm looking at is
you know
there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors
you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
well
in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now
for instance take computer science
you know we've got kids twenty years old
right now that could beat any computer
professor at microcomputer applications i know we do
and these people can't even get jobs doing anything [vocalized-noise] besides digging ditches
because there's no comprehensive test that they can take
that would allow them to s- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i mean
[laughter]
i mean my agree is absolutely worthless
it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
Industrial Marketing
well actually i'm selling computer software
but the two are mutually exclusive
because the
it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college
not my degree
which is i think kind of bizzaro
well let's
that's
we've already we've already got that
um-hum
well yeah
supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one
especially in my line because
you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
[laughter]
well not really
you know i mean i- there's
what what's to evalu -ate him on
you know i mean
uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero
i run the whole show
and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what i'm doing
you know and uh
that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation
because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
you know it's it's hard for me to y- you know especially since i'm in marketing sales
you know i make more than my boss [noise]
because he's salary and i'm not i make as much as i earn
you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
[laughter]
yeah well it's a little tough
but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make
but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is
you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
they're just there
you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything it's just that their jobs are useless
you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for
Ed Swampers Swampers' a guy who's in the union he's a laborer and he's assigned to
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
that's very spicy too
i mean these bell peppers and curry
oh that sounds really good
huh i guess it was is this dinner time for you
all done in advance
[vocalized-noise]
that's um [noise] i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little
you know uh
and i cook a little bit now [vocalized-noise] what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says you know oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight
so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh si- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
and um normally what happ- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular
oi- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um
maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor
and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um
a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze
that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat
cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms
it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice
oh you don't [laughter]
oh
uh-huh
yeah see we never in fact i never had squash growing up my my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up i'm i'm from Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town
yeah recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato
red meat and a potato
oh she had all of those types of vegetables
see never no vegetables in my family
yeah it was really funny
[laughter] well that was a real farm
no but i i've i've uh i've heard stories
[vocalized-noise]
uh
oh this is terr- uh you shouldn't be talking about this right before you're while you're fixing dinner
that's right you should be careful [laughter] that's pretty funny but my dad used to tell stories you know about the way they eat chickens but i never we never we lived in the suburbs we we bought everything in a grocery store
there was no but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more you know a lot of changes
i think so too
[noise]
but we just went shopping and we came back with uh with um sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts
[noise]
we came back with sweets we didn't bring all the healthy food back too
uh-huh
well that's that's supposed to be um the trend of the future
but uh the cut back i uh recently was over a friends house that's Indian and uh
she had brought Indian sweets into the office and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots
yeah that was a sweet and i was like ugh
this is a sweet oh it is it's a candy i'm like ugh you know Indian candy is not very good
but everything was and everything you didn't notice it at first but everything was sort of hot everything had a little bit of curry in every
it was funny even the sweets did
when you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it you know it had that that after taste that very it was a very Indian flavor
good they didn't have i didn't like her desserts very well
they were very yogurt and carrots and pin pistachios pistachio nuts and yogurt
and it wasn't very good
uh-huh
yeah
well have we done our ten minutes
something like that i think we're
no nor- normally they just come in and they say you've overextended your
your conversation
oh okay well that's you'll see it will normally it will come on and it'll say you've over extended your conversation you now have fifteen minutes to compl- fifteen seconds to complete it
but uh i've been cut off twice
so i just thought in fact [vocalized-noise] just also i'm hearing a siren outside i think my my neighbors car must have got bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car
one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and it's going off
so i was going to go out and see what they were doing
okay hey thanks so much
uh-huh and you said this was your fi- well you'll you'll get a couple more probably
i uh if i called yesterday i or Friday maybe i talked to somebody that uh
i got them on uh during the day it was a housewife and she was home with two kids
and while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny
okay
hey thanks a lot i'll talk to you later
bye
[noise]
okay in order to make the uh curried chicken i just fried the chicken
until it was nice and brown you know make sure it's nice and brown on both sides and then you take it out of the fat and you you let the chicken that you fried kind of drain so that a lot of the oil comes out of it
and then you you uh pour most of the all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil
and saute some um bell peppers and onions in in that little bit of oil maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons let that brown then put all of the chicken back in there
and then you uh mix flour and a cup of water maybe uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water stir it real real well
then you uh pour that in there you know to make the gravy
and you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add uh about a tablespoon of what i'm using now is Jamaican curry powder
and that's going to it's going to be really good [laughter]
yeah it's
right and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff
yeah
uh well
it will be in a little while i'm trying to get it get it ready early
oh
oh
uh-huh
what kind of wok do you have is it is it a real Chinese wok or
uh-huh
uh-huh
i see
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh i
yeah
oh that's
that sounds real good except the squash i just don't like squash i never did [laughter] my mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash and she'd have squash and corn bread [laughter] and maybe some she'd have chicken or something
and i'd just be
uh-huh
uh-huh [laughter]
oh that sounds good we we were from North Carolina and we had a garden and my mother would would uh grow the squash and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and a cabbage and collards and all kinds of
right
wow
you wouldn't believe it we even raised chickens [laughter] you ever seen anybody kill a chicken
no [laughter]
[laughter] and they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off [laughter]
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it dies down get just a little patter and then it
[laughter] getting ready to eat chicken too [laughter]
uh-huh
well that's good a lot of people are eating healthier now a days
yeah
ugh [laughter]
yeah i'm trying to learn how to cook um deserts without without all of the sweets you know maybe use honey or something
yeah
oh
[laughter]
uh right
the spice yeah
wow
yeah
yeah
huh
uh-huh
well i might have liked some of that i i like hot stuff
i really do [vocalized-noise]
oh is it ten minutes
i don't know do we get a signal
oh
well this is my first one
so
oh wow
um-hum
goodness
uh-huh
well okay
yeah thank you it was nice talking with you
yeah [laughter]
oh
yeah [laughter] kind of hard that way
okay
all right thank you bye-bye
[noise]
that's right uh i think so i had a sister who is in the Peace Corps as a matter of fact
uh back when it was uh [vocalized-noise] a Kennedy thing uh sixty
uh seven and eight
uh-huh
well i feel like if it were
[noise] if [vocalized-noise] if everyone had an equivalent requirement [noise] such that it were inescapable and i think that
that that would be important for me that that there wasn't that it was optional that if if every person and i could pick a time i guess rather than worrying about whether it was one years or two years suppose it were to be uh eighteen months
uh if every citizen were required to participate in public service and could choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any given time
and could not get out of that no matter what short of dysfunctional handicap
you know that the person were just unable to participate i guess i would not be against that as a requirement i i'm not sure the country needs it but i don't know that i would be against it and it
it seems to be it would be important that nobody could c- c- to opt out
it seems that you could have a menu where depending on the needs for jobs you could reward them differently and then let people compete for them if you you know i could envision somebody saying by the time you were
twenty five or pick some clock age that that would say you would have to give a certain number of years and you could you could say well i i could go in the army i could go in the navy i could go into civil service i could be a forest ranger a hospital attendant or whatever and
and i guess some jobs that might be higher risk you might want to compensate
with some reward that was higher which would
oh yeah that's interesting
uh like you can go go in the army for eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something [laughter]
uh-huh
how do you feel about whether it's necessary or not it if
uh it it seems like we tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but uh how do you feel about whether it's something that the country needs or what the benefits would be
um-hum
so you're say-
uh-huh
yeah it seems to me like there's a lot of infrastructure problems that we're accumulating in the United States that
uh we could address with with manpower everything from like well like national parks began to be in a state of decline because we can't fund their repair and some of them were built in a period during the depression when
there were deliberate programs put in place to get people occupied and so we put millions and millions of person hours into developing some of the parks systems and we can't afford to keep up
and we probably in order to return them to a state of a usefulness we'd have to invest those same person hours but we couldn't pay regular wages and
uh i guess it wouldn't bother me if the wages were barely scale or subscale if it were a sacrifice that everyone made
uh-huh
so i
so i wouldn't i guess i wouldn't feel like there would be a required compensation as any sort of uh the army approach room board and forty bucks a month to uh spend at the P X [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah well that would be back in the and he didn't have much more than that uh back in the sixties or so i mean it's a little more money than that but it wasn't very much it was you you didn't do much other than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife
uh
[noise]
okay
i think it's good that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or to that they've if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you
interesting
it appears that we've come to an agreement
okay thanks for calling
okay and from Raleigh bye
[noise]
so uh
[noise]
public service uh
i guess Peace Corps the one you think of the most
oh really
yeah i've never had any uh
experience with anyone that i've known personally in the Peace Corps my brother was uh
did a little uh guess you would call it kind of like missionary work to Liberia one time
when he was younger
i think uh
i think i kind of agree i think that uh
you know public service is uh has basically if you tie it in with uh you know a military option if you have a if have that requirement i think that uh
this ought to be an option at least you know to be uh some sort of a either domestic public service or a foreign type you know Peace Corps type of thing
yeah or maybe uh
yeah you maybe might adjust the time uh you know
yeah something like that i think they do that we have a German exchange student living with us and they uh he said they do that something like that in Germany
have uh
some kind of service that they have to go into
i think uh i think there's a number of reasons that it would be good to have it as a uh requirement
uh one being for the uh benefit of the youth or the individual them self
i think that uh there's a lot to be gained and a certain amount of discipline and uh
you know self uh
self control and so forth and gain by uh certain public service plus you know feeling of satisfaction and what have you
so i think uh you know also there's probably there's uh a lot to be said for uh you know the good that would be uh become of the public service works it might be uh and that aspect be helpful
yeah i uh i think i agree uh like
i guess i had that in the back of my mind like the WPA and some of those uh
type of projects
oh you're dating yourself there
[laughter]
that uh that was about the pay when i think i was in [laughter]
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
but uh
[laughter]
yeah exactly
but uh
you know i think the experience itself is positive
[noise] yeah i agree with that
[laughter]
have we [laughter]
we can't argue the point very much
yeah [vocalized-noise] uh so long from Houston
bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay so are you a fisherman
yeah you know i'm just about in the same situation here a few years ago i got really got into it hot and heavy and [vocalized-noise] about like you say i guess the last couple of years i've kind of gotten out of the it i've got kids now that are
are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and uh man i just don't have the time to go like i want to
oh really
[laughter]
yeah
i tell you it really is hard to to get time to go fishing uh you know unless you just
really really work at it almost it's it's it's almost like a second job
yeah yeah i'm i'm i like to go after them big old black bass
oh i got a few little old ponds up around here you know there's several around here just i do a lot of oh just small farm fishing and uh i mean small farm tank fishing and you know uh rock pit fishing but i've been to uh
oh the last i guess the last big lake i went to was Lake Fork
um-hum
yes
oh are you
yeah it's
yeah [laughter]
yeah that is a problem
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well i don't either really i- i like messing with the lures and [vocalized-noise]
that seems to be what the the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that's that's generally what i fish for you know because i don't particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them and throw them back
but it's uh you know i- i got into that mode where i was buying lures and and rods and reels and [vocalized-noise] just all kinds of stuff i had one of those little two man uh little two man boats that
used to go around a lot use that a lot but
like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so i got sold that and
but it's uh
but yeah so i'm kind of limited now to [vocalized-noise] going back to my old farm pond
well as a matter of fact uh last last fall uh in uh
October i guess i bought uh i bought a boat but i bought a a ski boat
gonna keep it
yeah yeah you can it's it's not the same as a bass boat but yeah you can get out on the water that's the main thing
but i- i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit uh he had uh he had a uh bass boat and he's the one i went to uh
oh like i say we went to Lake Fork and Cypress Springs and we've been to Lavon and Texoma just
[vocalized-noise] been around quite a bit in the kind of local area
but he sold his boat too so [laughter] so we just kind of
we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect
uh-huh
yeah that's well you don't have to but it it makes it easier you got to have uh well if you have a Texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake
if you have only a Texas license you have to stay on the Texas side of the lake which uh uh as it turns out most of the lake is in Oklahoma
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
g- go across the bridge across the water if it looks good you can just pullover and start it then
yeah now i've got most of mine hung up in the garage now like i say it's been a while since i've
since i've even gotten to go
pretty days
like today like this weekend of course it's too windy now but you know it usually dies down around sundown i've got a little old pond just
oh just a few hundred yards from my back door that i go over there occasionally but
you know it's pretty small and got pretty small fish in it but
it's nice to get out and just start splashing on the water or something
no i don't take any magazines but i like to watch old Berry Stokes
yeah he's he's about my favorite
[noise] B A S S yeah [noise] um-hum
oh really
yeah
yeah that's yeah i have taken some fishing magazines in the past and that's that's generally what i found that seemed like they spend a lot of time
uh discussing the type fishing that i wasn't really interested in
yeah
yeah
yeah it's really more kind of all over the south isn't it
yeah
yeah what uh what do you get when you uh when you join the B A S S what kind of benefits to you get
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
[noise]
yeah tackle and stuff
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i know the uh Bass Pro Shops uh i get their catalogs but [laughter] that's almost like a Christmas in the summertime when that comes but
yeah i've noticed they they're now
pushing a MasterCard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on on conservation measures and stuff
which is a good idea i guess
oh yeah
yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last five or ten years i guess it's it's really picked up in popularity again
so it's a lot more
you know a lot more people using the lakes and facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of the lakes
no i haven't
yeah now Ray Roberts i haven't been over there but i've i understand there's quite a few people who have been i- i think that's really going to be a good bass lake
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i understand it's kind of kind of restricted or or doesn't have easy access really
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah
which which is a yeah which is all right you know that that's all you can do that's all you can do but
it's good to get out there and and like i say throw the lure out and just
just piddle with it a little while
yeah
yeah some of them it takes a little while to get them to do what what you think they ought to be done
uh-huh yeah
yeah yes it's just that that pork skin uh
which you know you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork but yeah that's that's what it is it just
yeah uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah [vocalized-noise]
that's that's what is amazing you know all these different rigs that people come up with you know the Carolina worm rig and the like i said the jig and pig but
i'd i'd i like top water fishing myself you know everybody said
a little bit i have not uh have not done a lot of fishing in the last uh couple of years anyway but uh i like to fish so i i've i take fishing magazines and read and watch fishing TV shows
yeah
yeah
yeah well mine are are kids are both grown so that's uh that's that's past the point now where where i can use them as an excuse but
working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so
yeah
yeah what uh
yeah when you do fish do you fish for bass or just
yeah
go after the big ones yeah where have you fished recently
yeah
yeah i have not made it to Lake Fork yet although i've talked about it and uh
i've got uh i'm a CPA and i've got clients that uh or a client that lives on uh Lake Tawakoni
that has told me you know anytime i wanna fish you know just come on over
got a client that lives at Lake at Cedar Creek Lake and like i'm from East Texas so i've [vocalized-noise] got uh i think my brother-in-law may have a place at Lake Palestine so
you know i can go fishing just about anywhere i want to go but it's a matter of finding the time you know
but uh most of my fishing has been uh [vocalized-noise]
just you know whatever you know whatever will bite i'll fish for and my brother-in-law likes to fish for uh crappie
and so i fish a bit with him you know fishing for those and then uh you know i fish for bass fish but basically like i said fish for what whatever i can catch
i don't know enough about fishing to you know to say uh i'm going to go after a particular kind so
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah so so are you a
yeah so are you uh [vocalized-noise] anticipating buying another boat or just
[laughter] well you can fish for you can bass fish from a ski boat yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's
yeah
right on
um yeah
yeah well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at Lake Texoma i was going up there with a group
and uh
when i got there discovered you have to have a s- special license to fish on the lake right
yeah
yeah well that's what i understood anyway i- i d- discovered it was m- much better to have uh uh Texoma license
and i didn't have that so i said well i wasn't going to that plus there wasn't anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just won't worry about it
and that was probably the last time i even tried to fish and or even thought about it but
i've got uh my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the urge ever
ever bites you know i'm kind of available but
yeah right
but
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but uh do you uh read anything about fishing do you have any any books or magazines or anything that you take that you
yeah well i enjoy him too yeah but uh
yeah i watch i- i take uh have just started taking the that bass joined the Bass Anglers Club you know and get their magazine
and uh then i take the Texas Fisherman
uh
and uh you know i find those to be pretty good they uh the Texas Fisherman they uh they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know
along the coast
yeah
uh-huh
yeah and then of course i guess the Bass you know the Bass Anglers book is uh covers the pretty well covers the country
so you don't get a lot of Texas you know in particular coverage in that but
still you get some pretty good tips
i believe so it's their headquarters are in Alabama so
well [vocalized-noise] uh there's a number of things that you can get but basically you get the the magazine and you get that patch you know you know you get a patch and you get the bumper sticker
but then they they're always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago but they you know they send you offers and things uh
l- lure packages and things like that that you can
if you matter of fact if you uh get other people to sign up you know that to to sign up for the thing you know
then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but
but they've got uh i think they might even have a a Visa card or something that they promote you know through the club and
they've got uh discounts on travel rental cars and things like that that
yeah
right
yeah
yeah it's a good idea i think i think we need to we need to do a lot more on on the conservation than you know
yeah
yeah so you haven't fished uh Joe Pool Lake down here yet i guess or uh what's the other one Ray Roberts is that
yeah
yeah
yeah but uh yeah i uh Joe Pool is so close uh you know close into Dallas it's a little bit of a drive from Richardson
to get down there but i've got a uh couple of clients that are down in that area
i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just
like i said just pull over and fish a while
if i can find a p- a place to get to the water somehow
yeah so i guess the the main thing is you know when you're [vocalized-noise] like you say when you're carrying your tackle around in the trunk of your car and you don't have a boat laying in the trunk your car y- you're kind of restricted to bank fishing so
so you have to find a spot
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah i enjoy watching the just watching the lure work in the water sometimes just see what it does it uh [laughter]
yeah
[noise] yeah
[vocalized-noise] one thing uh in fishing that i have not ever [vocalized-noise] have not done and i'm not really sure what they mean i guess is when they're talking about
using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they
like they use uh just uh it's like a hook with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of uh of rubber pork type stuff on the hook itself
um-hum
but it's just hung on the hook
yeah huh
i guess i couldn't imagine that it [vocalized-noise] anything like that until i started reading about it and you know and i thought you know that sounds like okay but i never would have thought of doing it so
um-hum
okay i guess its recording um what kind of hobbies do you have do you sing or knit or anything
okay i uh i started knitting awhile ago i knitted i didn't know even know what the stitch is called i just had this uh
uh piece of yarn and i wanted to start something so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old so i kept doing that and now i have a little blanket but that's all i've done
so
um do you make sweaters and things or just blankets or
uh-huh
oh i see
hum
uh-huh
i probably won't make anything beyond this blanket [laughter] i don't know why it's just too time consuming
um i like to sing i've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that
um right now my actual job is a news reporter but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally
but um [vocalized-noise]
yes uh-huh i i'm in uh i work for channel six in Waco
and so i do little news reports and things that
it's not as exciting as it [laughter] as it sounds
but um
[vocalized-noise]
uh no not much um my day is usually pretty full my schedule is like from nine to five thirty but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine -til
nine at night or ten or whatever so it's hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby
and even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work i'd probably never get to it you know so
what do you do
normally
oh okay
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
oh
right
i show- i showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like you didn't make that
oh yeah it it looks uh halfway decent actually [laughter] first thing i did but
yeah
[noise] how many children do you have
oh okay i hear them in the background there
[laughter] all right that's a hobby in itself
[laughter]
a job in itself [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
right now i was just sitting here watching TV i was getting ready to fall asleep
but uh
yeah i sang at one last summer um it was my first wedding i've done um little commercials and background singing and
um i sang all through college and things like that but i really haven't done anything really professional perse but i did one wedding last year and uh
[noise] i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say singer and what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something and i've been passing them out to different wedding shops i mean when someone comes in
you know for a wedding for a wedding dress and they they might ask about it
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know if any one wants to listen
and uh she wanted me to bring it in she's going to play it on Saturday so
[laughter] that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice
but uh
i haven't got any calls yet but i only just put them out this week so hopefully i'll get some calls in especially now since this it's spring and it's the wedding season i guess
um-hum
yeah that would be great then i could be getting paid for something i love to do not that i don't like reporting but i'd love it
[noise]
no i've never i've never had uh formal training i've just been singing every chance i get i try you know in school and yeah choirs and
um when i was at UT i was in a group called Ensemble One ow Nine just twelve singers and we did uh little conventions and um
uh like dinner parties and things like that
sing pop music
so that's what got me really really interested in it
so i'm trying to be sen- sensible too at the same time
yeah exactly my parents would have a fit probably
but uh i think i either have a ca- or yeah i do have a call hold on one second
[noise]
hello
yes okay that's my mother on the other line i need to go
but um i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to hear a beep or anything
oh okay my mother said ten minutes so i don't know but uh
okay well it was nice talking to you and and
good luck with your hobbies [laughter]
thanks bye
[noise]
well i um i do cross-stitch and i enjoy reading and playing softball
oh really well i know that i learned how to knit one time and um
made a few things but i haven't done it in so long that i probably wouldn't remember how
well if i remember i think we made some like Christmas stockings you could make the like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make Christmas stockings and
maybe some slippers or something like that nothing as big as a blanket i know that my
husband's grandmother does a lot of that and she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff but
[laughter]
yeah do you have any other hobbies
[noise] oh well that's good
so are you on the TV then
oh
oh okay
[laughter]
so you don't have too much time for hobbies
yeah
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
um
i'm a housewife
so unless the kids are asleep i don't get usually get much done either [laughter]
[laughter]
but i've made a um few things cross-stitch things i really enjoy doing that and um
i made uh like stockings for both my children and a Christmas tree skirt and that type of thing and
it just takes a long time to get it done but you know once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to to see it but
really [laughter]
[laughter]
i guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long
two
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
not quite
[laughter]
it's a full-time job yeah
so um have you sang at any weddings yet
um-hum
um-hum
oh that's a good place yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah [laughter]
well that's good
yeah
oh that's true
make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good huh
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
did you have training in singing when you were younger then or
choirs and that kind of stuff
huh well that's nice
um-hum
yeah not just give up your job and jump right into it [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
[noise]
yes
oh
i don't know i've only done this one other time and i thought that the man told me five minutes so
oh okay
it was nice talking to you too good luck with your singing
okay bye
[noise]
so what's your opinion about the uh the increasing roles of women in society today
uh-huh
see uh the way the way i look at it is that
i don't think that the that there's more women in you know working today i think that the role of women in society is changing in a way that instead of working in the house
they're working you know for paying jobs so it seems that women are becoming more prominent in society you know it seems that they're doing more work i think the work is the same it's just that they're getting different jobs different
you know they're they're how do you say they're uh
yeah they're they're uh up into more open space where more people can see what work they're doing
you know you don't get credit for working in the house but you do get credit for being the president of a corporation
exactly visible
right
exactly
uh-huh
exactly just as important
yeah i think that's the that's also has a lot to do with uh today's society you know in in the past the uh the woman was suppose to be at home cooking for the men who were working
nowadays it's like everything is so is is so integrated a man can be a mother nowadays you know it's like just like uh what was that movie uh Mister Mom seven years ago
and you know it's it's true you don't you know a woman and a man are are pretty much equal nowadays in in work it's like
you don't have to be a woman to be a babysitter you can be a guy you don't have to be a man to be uh you know the president of a corporation it's it's not it's not what you are it's what your abilities are
that's the that's the important thing so it doesn't you know it's it's integration of it doesn't matter if your a man or a woman that makes it all you know everything makes everybody look equal for a job so it doesn't matter
nowadays that you know there's there's really no difference is is you know the the law the law says there's no difference so more women are are taking that opportunity to be in those spots
too many
oh okay okay
yeah
right
uh-huh
one thing that's kind of due to the the market you know uh uh a woman's cookie store is much preferred to a man's you know a woman's clothing store is much preferred to a a man's clothing store for women you know
like you uh a guy wouldn't want to buy a car designed by a women
you know it's just like that
it's it no it's just these these things you know these these uh values that that you're brought up with
oh see that's different uh a computer is unisex
unless you design it in some sort of way which can really satisfy you and not a man around [noise] i don't know
exactly you know it's like
just one of those those things uh that you're brought up with
well even i'm sure there is but you know you don't want you don't want a car that's designed a man doesn't want a car that's purely designed by a woman same reason that you may not want a dress or you may not want you know you you
of course but they're homosexual
[laughter]
yeah those those men are homosexual like uh what's that Pierre Cardin and and uh Halston course he died of AIDS so there that's proof
well i have to go eat dinner now
uh thank you very much for talking bye
[noise]
well i think the biggest change in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work
now i think overall there's been a change i don't think um that's uh
been surpassed by anything else than uh that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we have to have people to babysit and such
employed outside the home now
[laughter]
more visible things and things that use different kinds of mental skills
maybe that's a a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending on uh
you know how big the house is and whether you had you know a lot of children may not take as much mental skills and such as what working outside the home does
uh i think a lot of the modern conveniences today you know have eliminated matter of fact you know i think women
even back maybe two hundred years ago when we were first starting the country may have been looked at a little differently because it was really important to have the woman there
and she probably you know gave half of the uh work output in like a farm
you know her skills were as needed as the man's to you know to like establish a farm from the beginning
and then it got to be that you know with the industrial age i think the women uh were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big operation as a farm and their the work was more confined to the household chores
which didn't really uh have as much to do with the whole livelihood of the family if you were in a farm situation
it's kind of kind of kind of gone all the way around that way in the beginning you know their work input for a farm and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such was as important as the man's you know needed both
and then she got to be kind of in the house when that wasn't needed as much and now she's kind of like back out of the house but not working for the family business working you know somewhere else
yeah
[laughter]
well some are kind of forced to but i did see something in the paper today i didn't read it through thoroughly but there was uh article about a a project a study that Elizabeth Dole had started when she was still at the Department of Labor
something called Glass Ceiling it was trying to look at
how uh much opportunity there is for women executives to move up they're still saying that there are too many women in higher uh echelons as management you know CEO's and that kind of thing
n- no there's not many they're saying that there's kind of like a glass ceiling that uh you just don't find too many women in those positions i think it will just kind of take time um
you know for women to be more acce- you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and experiencewise i mean
starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills to be a CEO
and i'm a little frustrated too because a lot of women who have their own businesses
still don't seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of consider a more woman kind of business i call it like the three C's [laughter] like they're into cookies like Mrs Fields
and [laughter] they're into cosmetics [noise] like Mary Kay and they're into uh clothing
you know but they haven't really branched out into some other things like you don't find too many women uh really involved with technology
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
why
why
[laughter]
how about a computer designed by a woman
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh oh okay [laughter]
but historically
[laughter] historically you think of cars being done by Ford and such so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
well there's possibility that there's some woman on those design teams [laughter]
hey there's some men designers out there that do very well Bob Macky and such
[laughter]
[laughter] oh oh oh [laughter]
[laughter]
okay all right bye
[laughter]
[noise]
well the thing is is that uh since i'm in school i don't like basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad
[noise]
but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know it's like [vocalized-noise] the the beginning of the semester when you g- have to pay for everything
everything's pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know it's like once the semester start i'm the one who has to control how much spending there is
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food and uh so
well the thing is is that i live in a dorm
so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts and the the tuition is also the same thing
so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and that's about it
but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week
so i mean it's for for us you know it's like i- i can spend i can spend that money but it's not it's not what i want to spend it on you know
no because um they don't allow me to work since uh i'm a foreign student
and so they the government doesn't allow me to work
uh-huh
well the thing is is that um i ba- i basically know how much i have right
and so the thing is is that
i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller
and besides see o- one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international
Argentina yeah
and so the bas- one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills
well that's they w- they want me to call down there every so often i me- i told my dad li- dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you
no because it's more expensive that way uh any any uh basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of
and uh because it's considered luxury in other countries
right since it's his money anyway you know
no uh i got money to pay that too
so it's basically you know it's like it's not too much money and it's not too little money so i won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
i'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering
with those degrees
well i can i can work up uh here up to a year
and hopefully get a job after that
uh computer communications and data transmissions
right
yeah you know anywhere from uh local area networks metropolitan area networks you know all that and and so well you have a family right
and does does your wife work
oh okay
yeah
okay
yeah
and so and you have a monthly budget
right
so you don't have any problem in uh overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that
yeah yeah
well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which i don't
see like i i don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i don't wa- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know like
like m- uh for Ch- for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack
you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack
right because i i needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that
right but
right but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down Argentina it was to me was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you don't care about you know it's like
yeah and so but the thing is is that um
yeah
yeah yeah
well for example we had spring break now and i went skiing and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars or
so uh but you know its like uh
yeah yeah because it's like you know say you know it's like we're saying let's go eat out before spring break i go let's not go eat out before spring break let's see how much money we have afterwards
and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i won't go out you know
and so like my roommate went home i went skiing in uh over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything
[noise]
but um
but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it you know it was a nice place
yeah yeah
yeah especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy
so oh well let's see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half okay yeah
all right well nice talking to you all right bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
yeah
yeah
what about tuition and rent who takes care of that
uh
yeah
no can't do that very often
are a- are you working anywhere while you're going to school
okay
oh okay
yeah so all the money comes from home
so you got to make uh so how do you keep track of where you are in in your monthly spending
right
yeah
where do you call to
Argentina wow
yeah talk too long
yeah
yeah
yeah so you call him collect
i would suspect so
yeah
oh okay so you just call him direct and then
yeah so that and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him
okay
yeah
yeah what are you s- what are you studying
and what do you think you'll do with that
um-hum
and i mean
you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or or what's the specialty that you're looking for
oh okay so you want to find a uh data transmissions you're looking for uh
um
long distance
type stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah i have uh wife and two children and uh a-
no she doesn't work she does uh well it's kind of hard to say now days uh other than taking care of the house she does a lot of sewing herself and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in
she's trying to start h- her own business where she does that full time uh alterations and sewing and stuff for the public and uh do that on a on a full time basis here in town
well s- sort of we're probably like most Am- American families i guess that we sort of have a budget in that we know how much we've got at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid
and uh we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with with the monthly budget so
oh sure we're like everybody else you know you we've got a uh
several credit cards that sometimes uh
instead of paying them all off at every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around Christmas time you know that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but something that you can use
yeah
that's very uh utilitarian you know
you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts
yeah
that's true why bother yeah
well especially being a college student you your i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving you know that effects the budget especially around uh Christmas time it's the end of the semester you've got finals and you've got lots of bills i would suspect
what about when you have breaks like uh Christmas or between sessions
yeah
i expect so
you've got to budget that though you've got to save up in able to do that right
i mean
hm hm yeah
yeah
right right
right
hm
sure it is any time you can get away and and get away from from the daily grind
yeah i know the feeling
is that okay
all right
oh
nice talking to you have a good time bye
[noise]
[noise]
i guess i'm going to school while i'm uh working at TI so there's not a whole lot of time that i've got uh for hobbies seems like lately
but one of one the things that i do when i've got some spare time is and i do some woodworking and that oh i guess ranges anywhere from uh
carpentry work to uh uh some types of furniture and uh oh i don't know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on and
i made some uh candle sconces that you hang on the
there's something about working with wood that that i enjoy that i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood but you know
yeah because it's it's out there you know i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust and the wife gets kind of aggravated at that but then i get the opportunity to vacuum
so i guess i get s- some of both uh what are some of your things you like to do
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it's a good time for gardening
i could do with a little less wind but i think the the temperature's been pretty good so far for working outside
do you find you do most of your your uh crocheting or your knit work around Christmas time
yeah
well that's kind of what my wife says she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her l- her legs and feet with while she's working on it
i know seems like she i think she made three this year one for uh my father-in-law and and then a couple of brothers and sisters so uh sh- those things they take some time to make
oh that's kind of like quilting
i think the
mile a minute
well i'm not sure what she does i i first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan
i guess that's your standard knitting isn't it
yeah
i know [vocalized-noise]
oh okay
call instead of call waiting or call anything else
[noise]
well i guess that that's one way to end a conversation
yeah what uh have you started your garden yet
um boy
oh yeah always got to have those
i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them died but i i got
s- you know i put them i chop them up and put them in jars and usually give them away because i do- there's no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them but always got to keep those planted
well that's kind of the way i am um
i planted uh zucchini last year uh i planted four hills of them i think i had three or four s- seeds in each one of them
and those things just flat took over um it wasn't -til late
i guess in the summer
maybe it was because it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later it seems like all i got was
i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so i don't know if i'm mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i don't
i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
it may not be it may not be
you think they are later in the year
uh
well that's true mostly okra that's grown around here is is later okra
well that's about uh
go ahead well i was just going to say we [vocalized-noise] it's a little over six or seven minutes so whenever you feel comfortable about concluding well i'm um that'd be fine
well all right i guess we'll call this one quits and thanks for participating
all right have a good time
bye
[noise]
yeah i have quite a few of those that my uncle made
[laughter] i think it's more like the mess you make isn't it and you don't have to worry about cleaning it up
well when i have time i do like to sew um i had been doing a lot of crocheting i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them
my mother was real heavy into crafts and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing and then she would go to these uh arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework
so a lot of times i'd help her with that i haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going
oh yeah it's been beautiful this last week but
yeah
i usually start in the fall
and [vocalized-noise] my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm
yeah
yeah i found one that's real easy it- it's um
um um shoot i can't even remember the name of it now but you make it in strips and it's real easy to do and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that but it's
yeah yeah
Mile a Minute that's the name of it
Mile a Minute
yeah yeah usually single crochet would is is always starts it off
if we have a problem with our connection and get disconnected some time or other don't worry about it we have a a very small phone company down here
and [noise] my husband says that's called rinky-dink [laughter]
no no we can't have that down here we get disconnected all the time
yeah well it gets a little aggravating i've got kids all over the United States and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them
yes we planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers
uh
what else did i get in there and jalapeno peppers
yeah
yeah [vocalized-noise] oh my husband doesn't like them either but i can always give them away
besides they're fun to grow
supposedly after the soil warms up
um-hum
i- i doubt if zucchini is in there
probably the same time the the other squash is though
yeah
about the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm
yeah
we decided this year i'm sorry go ahead
oh just anytime
all right well i've enjoyed talking to you
okay bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh Robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution
right
[laughter]
do you um do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial um areas factories and so on
i was going to say and and you so you understand smog [laughter]
um-hum
wow
my word
and that was a few years ago
i- i wonder if it's any better now
because they uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on um
i- i don't know if you h- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um Colorado um against a power company
uh that's actually on Indian land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon
and um i- particularly in the winter months so they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um i can't think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on
i don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of new- pieces of news you know and so it's hard
i never did see the full story so i don't know but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing
which would be horrible because the there's nothing i mean that's such a spectacle it'd be a shame to ruin it
uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem
right
um-hum you think it's more we- more in society well i guess i kind of agree there i
um on an individual basis there isn't a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh
force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit i'm not always real politically active but i do think that
um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards and it's brought their the they uh really listen to the the uh lobbyist
and uh the m- car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed saying all those re- those restrictions too hard we can't we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution
um so i suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators
but um as a society i think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it
uh individ- being individually responsible a- as uh [laughter] in order to be group responsible
right
um-hum
i suspect that the pub- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um
governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't
and uh i don't know how long that that'll take
sure
exactly yeah right
right
yeah
well it's just the same thing with the car um uh the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't um run into this kind of problems we've recently had
and yet the government's not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't wanna they don't want to pay for it so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war um you know f- wha- however
i- it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor
um and i think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se- get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh
then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help um uh do you have any air pollution in your area
oh no [laughter]
your talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on
yeah we really don't have that either although i think i can tell a difference in i lived in this area for about twenty five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level um particularly in the summer
uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air um usually they say caused by exhaust
it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on so i suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem
well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here it was nice talking to you
so did i bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
um
gee i don't i mean i i guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust you know they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that
so i believe them but i'm not a chemist
i don't really know um i grew up in Los Angeles and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution
i understand it very well and in fact i was a private pilot there
and i can remember very etched etched clearly in my mind
uh flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at what looked like a uh
it just looked liked peanut butter
thick and brown and so on
this was quite a few years ago this was in the nineteen sixties
people say that it is somewhat better
right
hm
so did it burn coal
yeah
hm
yeah
yeah
uh
i don't uh i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals um maybe
just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing
um apart from that
i i don't know what we can do as individuals what do you think we can do
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i guess i'm i'm to the point where i'm cynical enough that i really don't believe anything will happen unless unless there's something economically justifiable about it
and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out at some point down the road to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else
that we'll spend the money that's necessary to uh to get rid of the source of it
yeah
people also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it so if you don't want to burn coal for power how about nucle- nuclear energy well we don't want that either
how about investing in the sun well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour i don't think uh i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down it wou- [vocalized-noise]
yeah
oh yeah yeah yes
yes
yes
oh certainly yeah
yeah
there's not really a lot here in Raleigh uh once in a while we'll get some uh i think it kind of washes down from
uh the [laughter] from your area Linda [laughter]
that's what they that's what they
[laughter]
yeah
yeah that's what they say but it's it's not it's not very usual and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities
um-hum um-hum
yeah
yeah
right i think we've given them about seven minutes according to my watch and i enjoyed the conversation
bye
[noise]
[noise] all right have you lived in this area long
okay
yeah it's it it's it's a lot warmer a lot drier too because usually about this time of year there's you know you see a little bit more rain
i mean by uh by mid February i mean we start getting a lot of rain
but it
um-hum
yeah unseasonable i used to my wife and i we used to live in San Antonio couple years ago and it was [noise] it was i remember the first day of spring it was so much ice that came down
later on that a- that afternoon evening it was just it was horrible
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
well um i don't know i- i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather um i l- i like it warmer i mean i like it
you know i like it warm but it doesn't really matter i mean i'd i would much rather see it cooler at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly
but um
[laughter] well i spent three years in Germany so i'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway [laughter]
[laughter] i mean i got used to it it was really strange i mean when i when when when we came to San Antonio it was just like uh
uh you know it just just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just
it's it's not it's not that it's just [noise] hot or dry it's just it's not very comfortable it just
yeah a little bit
yeah it
yeah my wife and i the last day we were in Florida we my visiting my um [noise] my my parents and my brother and sister
we were we were down there and
the last day right before we left we had to i had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car and you know you g- you you -ust get used to air conditioning all the time
and this it was just the humidity was like eighty plus eighty percent plus and it was just killing us
yeah
yeah well [noise] i mean i've i- i- i guess i've i've been to some places you know where the weather was just so mild you know places like Monterey California or
you know it's just you know so mild and then b- been to such extremes like San Angelo Texas where you just where you walk outside and you sweat you know you're sweating
you look down at your arm but you see the water leaving your arm it's so hot and you feel it pulling away
bizarre
yeah
yeah
i tend to agree but
i don't know i- i think in in some in some respects it
oh it seems more tolerable
[laughter] no the other topics [noise] i got one topic they said talk about the Middle East sit-
well
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] well [laughter] i mean i've had some pretty bad i guess some pretty controversial topics so it's just like well that was my fault but [laughter]
[laughter] but then the weather's like man i mean it's it get's pretty mundane i mean you can only talk about [noise] about the situation you know just so long
[noise]
okay bye-bye [noise]
no i've only been here a couple of years uh but uh i- i- i've noticed that uh this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past
yeah yeah well i remember last year or or the year before uh we had ice and snow we had a had a terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year
and uh this year it's been so hot and uh sunny it it it's really uh quite uh quite amazing
hm
yes i was just talking to my son today he's up in Boston and it was twenty nine there and it was you know in the seventies out here and it was really uh [laughter] he really wished he could be here rather than there
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh i haven't you know i d- i don- i think it's really been delightful i- i come uh i've spent most of my time in in warm weather areas and uh uh the ice and snow just doesn't uh hold any allure for me at all
uh-huh
[laughter]
he- do you you think think San Antonio's more comfortable than Dallas
um-hum
you must well uh -t it must be quite a bit hotter down there isn't it
oh wow
oh yes
oh yeah it's terrible
yeah Orlando is the only place i've ever been where i've seen the car sweat [laughter] i mean yeah that's really bad
uh-huh uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
yeah
hm wow
hm i know i- i- i tend to
i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate uh uh it doesn't doe- some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but
uh i i'd rather you know like southern California you know have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time
so it's kind of a luxury
well i guess this the weather isn't as as lively a topic as uh as some of the others we might have gotten
[vocalized-noise]
i guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something like about what my daughter is here prodding me say good-bye [laughter] we messed up the conversation [laughter] anyway [laughter]
[noise]
inspiring okay well nice talking to you Tony [noise]
[noise]
do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace
yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive be- being reported
uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work
and uh it gives you the uh im- [vocalized-noise] the uh impression that the company really doesn't trust the people that work for them
and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results
yeah
yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test
but there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later
or if the prescription say ran out or if you're using something that's uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever
yeah
yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected
uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session
and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record
it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records
sure
yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period
and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random
so i'm not sure exactly what they base that on
yeah um-hum sure
okay
well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time
and many have not been tested yet
uh couple of years yeah
okay [laughter] it took them awhile to find me
oh no well th- they did all the all the top level managers
uh at first
and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn
so they called me in uh just a few months ago
right
oh no [laughter] i never thought about that i- i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though
asked her if she enjoyed her job [laughter]
[laughter]
she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people [laughter]
so i try i try to introduce some levity there
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have
and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle
oh yeah
yeah well i know some people that i suspect are casual users of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh
in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis
because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time
and even the first time uh for these people are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or management and they're jeopardizing their positions
yeah yeah
well some companies have gone that far uh TI has not
but others have and they're setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh
than we are
yeah
right i don't mind so much the fact that they test people but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh
uh [laughter]
i- i- i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else
right
yeah well if if you turn down the counseling the- they will fire you
that's uh condition of employment
sure
is that right
i thought that's the only one that the government does use so
i'm not sure
okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well
gives them full reign uh trust the results because they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot
they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe
okay well uh hum
i think yeah i'm sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about
i enjoyed it okay sure bye
[noise]
[noise]
um i have mixed feelings about it um i don't particularly care for people who take drugs and uh it's a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but um i also feel like it's an invasion of privacy
[noise]
right right
um-hum um-hum
right
right yeah yeah i have a lot of problems with it um i um i have been tested also several times and uh in fact it has always come up negative i mean but that's no problem with it
coming up negative but i do take prescription drugs and i'm always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests
yeah
[noise]
right
um-hum
right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh they're trying to uh you know they're they're saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i don't really appreciate that at all
um-hum
right
no no because this can follow you um at other places too
i was reading uh this morning in the newspaper where it was talking about um [noise] they have companies or or organizations out now who will go and do background searches on uh employees before they ever hire them
and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and you're fired from your job that's going to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if it's truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time
right
um-hum um-hum
[noise]
well uh cause you work for TI also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh take your name out of the hopper
so that whatever is left in the hopper you know it's it's um uh that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested then it'd be taken out of there so that's that's how they said they would uh do it over a five year period
um-hum
um well it's only been what a year two years
um-hum um-hum yeah it hadn't been i know i was called up right away [laughter] it didn't no i was called up let's see yeah we started testing in January and i was called up right away in January
uh-huh
uh-huh
right right
um-hum yeah but yeah you're right that wasn't a very pleasant experience
especially i felt like there was a camera watching
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter] what'd she say
[laughter] yeah on a continuing basis too [laughter]
[laughter] you know that was uh that was a really interesting because it was a great big room the bathroom it was it was a great big room and uh and i remember th- the vents you know just right over the top of the toilet
a- and i just just knew i was being photographed you know i just [laughter] i'm glad i don't have to go through that experience again [laughter]
[noise]
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
well um i guess growing up in the sixties and uh i don't know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some friends who are occasional uh marijuana smokers and
you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation
and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy
but i don't particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into drugs or anything else so it's not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view
[noise]
um-hum
right
yeah yeah
um-hum
yeah
[noise]
oh yeah yeah i i could really see that uh so yeah they'll just have to find other means of uh relaxing and
[laughter]
but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those so-called uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol
um-hum
um-hum
i think so yeah yeah but you know [vocalized-noise] alcohol destroys you know so many families so now
so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs
you know [noise]
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial [laughter] it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're going i don't i don't [laughter]
right
right
right yeah i think there's some flaws in it i i think their main objective is is good you know to make sure they have a drug free workplace but i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there
and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using
um [noise] yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be
oh well i heard just the opposite
[laughter] so i don't know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they
um-hum
yeah
right
um-hum
oh
yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too
is our five minutes up [laughter] okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye
[noise]
[noise]
well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly
uh-huh
[noise]
no
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh you will
relax
well i watch um i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program
[noise]
yeah i- i like that i i watch that a couple of times a week
um it comes on like at nine o'clock at night and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i- i have seen that um
Murphy Brown that comes on Monday nights before and it's kind of cute and but i don't
uh-huh
oh the
uh-huh
right i know who you're talking about i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once
[laughter] i like that
well i um i we really don't watch
too many programs regularly my children like some of the morning children's shows when they're home they um i just have one son who's in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like um
Eureka's Castle it's called it's just like a Sesame Street show but
[noise]
and they watch a couple of shows like that
but i don't watch any daytime TV at all
and uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
oh that's nice
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
that sounds like a good idea
i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed
and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because
there's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else
and so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved
[noise]
uh-huh
well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is
the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies
that i have really enjoyed that i'm seeing for the first time [laughter] like the Marx Brothers [noise] and things like that
[noise]
[noise] uh-huh
right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and
and
um-hum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime y- you take the notion
and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and
they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss
[laughter]
yes well and things are repeated
so often that
you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show [laughter] if i ever decide to tune it in again
the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again
pretty funny
but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say
um-hum and we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time
so it's a little bit
something we try doing and there's there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day
and you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if they're good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them
anyway
well
yeah that was pretty good i- i like that and um i guess it's time to go
yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh this is kind of tough i don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis
i don't have a lot of time and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don't think they have any redeeming value
but uh oh i watch things like uh Sixty Minutes every week uh
ooh
it's kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh Knots Landing [laughter]
yeah just something like that for you know
uh end of the evening type of thing but uh
how about you
um
yeah i don't get that so i don't have that choice
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while uh i can't think of the name of the one that has the uh military
uh fellow i mean he's playing a military part he's the husband of the girl on Designing Women
yeah you know it wa- it was on one time when i saw it and you know it it's pretty cute
yeah
uh-huh
yeah no i don't
i guess uh there's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly
on Saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but uh
they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that
and um they have a lot of cooking shows
and oh you know i'll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i don't sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if i'm
uh cooking on a Saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me
uh-huh
yeah
yeah we do some of that in i'm fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on TV than you know other kinds of things
yes
yeah
[noise] yeah those are pretty good i- i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff
yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable
yeah
uh-huh
i'm not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal [laughter]
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
yep
yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on
right i agree
uh-huh
right
yeah
okay well we probably exhausted that huh
okay i enjoyed talking to you
okay good-bye
[noise]
okay well my favorite probably all time TV show is Star Trek
and i would [vocalized-noise] like that i i like the adventure of it
and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space
and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and
finding out about different people and i've i've always liked that show probably the very best
uh-huh
yeah those the movies are good too
and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they're all adventures [laughter]
when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver
because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and
and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and [laughter]
you haven't
uh-huh
he's like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly
and uh h- his big thing is that he can take pieces of
little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder
so he [laughter] he does all kinds of strange things like that
yeah [laughter]
[laughter] see what we can come up with do you like the uh news shows Twenty Twenty an- Sixty Minutes those kind of things
uh-huh
some of the little things yeah
[laughter]
uh
oh
i guess i haven't ever had any trouble with that i have more or less i have my favorite shows and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those
but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just
a minimum amount of time really when they're up
because they're i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids
i like that real well
uh-huh i don't think they have that on anymore
i haven't seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones
i haven't seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good
yes yeah they still show Mister Rogers i don't think he's making new ones but they repeat all the old ones
so that's still a real good show too i that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the TV on
Sesame Street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it's the timing of of it is good besides the am- what's on
yes i have two little ones
so they like that
they come on both they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six
they just repeat
over again which is also that's another thing that's [laughter] good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour i f- can feel like i can let them sit in front of the TV and watch
and they're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot
yeah [laughter]
uh it didn't hurt them any
some shows are good for i think some shows some Star Trek i for the imagination of it all
the idea i i think that's one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do
you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible
that kind of thing
okay well i think we've covered most of my favorite TV shows
[laughter]
let's see how about uh Man From Uncle
that's Mission Impossible
yeah they always have i've i've seen some of them on repeats
that uh they always had a good plot
it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next [laughter]
how they're going get out of their latest scrape
oh yeah every Saturday night
huh
[laughter]
um
ye- i'm not old enough to recall that one
[laughter] my TV viewing started sort of mid sixties so
my folks didn't my folks i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little that may be why bu- they probably didn't have a TV until i got to be
you know grade school or so
and the shows that i like now they wouldn't let me watch i had to catch them all on repeats like Star Trek they thought that was much too violent for small children so
[laughter] i i i i ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something
yeah
probably so
well i think that's about uh
that's about covered it for me so i think i'll say good-bye and we'll
talk another time perhaps [noise]
i'm calling from Garland Texas
uh-huh
where were you from
oh my goodness i didn't know they did it long distance [laughter]
yes
well it was nice talking to you [noise]
bye-bye
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
right
[noise]
uh-huh
i think i've actually seen a number of Star Treks one way or another over the years
uh although i never watched it regularly i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters and then i've seen some of the Star Trek movies
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
i don't think i i've even heard of that show it's called McGyver and what is what is he
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
oh great Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a 747 out of it
[laughter]
well uh i used to watch Sixty Minutes as a matter of fact and uh and i used to like the show very much
but unfortunately i find getting rid of your TV set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water
and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didn't get the booze out of the house i was going to drink
so
yeah
yeah yeah
right well when my kids were little i did have a TV set and i did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company as well
oh that would be a shame
huh
yeah how about Mister Rogers is he still around
i see i see
uh-huh
right i figure your children are preschool
yeah
yeah i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon
uh-huh okay
okay
yeah
yeah little with little kids the TV set really is a
i mean i used it as a pacifier i'm not sure it was that great for my children but they turned out okay so
[noise] yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well i'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh
i do seem to reme- is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that self-destructed
uh Mission that's right Mission Impossible yeah i used to watch that in fact i can still remember a couple of those they were i thought those were very good
yeah
huh
right right you
yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household
was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i g- i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene
uh that por- portraying The Doors appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show
they even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan and it was very very funny i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie
well i don't know was there any i remember the Milton Berle Show even i was
i was well i guess i have to admit that i am [laughter]
i see
yeah
huh
yeah that's that's interesting uh i think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV people were just as violent before TV was invented maybe even more so
but i guess that's that's a different topic isn't it
[laughter]
yeah well it was nice talking to you tell me tell me where you're calling from
Garland Texas all right i'm in Nor- i'm in Raleigh North Carolina
yeah i think they're doing it trying to do it or i hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different
different dialects
same here bye-bye
[noise]
okay i think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing [vocalized-noise] threat to the United States how do you feel about that
i'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden
they're very large
and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around
and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um
i i'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it
and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that's not my job
absolutely
and and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward
and i think that that is giving them i'm expecting a call and unfortunately i think it's come through i've enjoyed talking to you thank you bye
[noise]
okay
i don't really i more
[noise] i don't know about the government as much as um
the people uh i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all
and i really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore i'm i'm worried about them they're in a very uh
tumultuous state right now with the kinds of uh adaptations that they're attempting to go through
so
[noise] yeah
yeah i think that's that's a real important aspect and that uh as the the mo- the most the mo-
let's see
the more that we d- that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk
of that becoming a you know a reality [noise] i know that uh
this last winter was very hard on uh several areas in the in the the Ukraine particularly the coal mining regions
of Siberia uh the people there have money that's not their problem but there's no food for them to buy and its you can't eat money
yeah
right they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through
now and um
[vocalized-noise] they've been they've been under under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they don't know how to act yet
they don't understand that to make that work they've got to take some responsibility for themselves it's not just the government's responsibility anymore
you can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well
okay all right bye-bye
uh-huh
yeah
oh no no they're not are they
oh goodness i would too even the bench warmer i would [laughter]
um-hum
[vocalized-noise] yeah
i do to um [noise] i have boys you know l- like eight and eleven and we go quite often to watch the Rangers
um-hum oh yes we're heavy into that too
oh i do too and i think uh what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan you know yes
uh-huh
yes yeah yeah huh uh-huh
yep yeah i know yeah yeah
he really is and you know as far as
predictions and stuff i really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year
they coul- because i don't know but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything i really do
yeah yeah at least that should help it sure should
but in a way i really do and of course there's a few more you know i think are good ball teams also like Oakland A's and the Giants i really do
yes i like to go watch the Giants when they come to Houston sometimes
but uh
oh you haven't oh i have a few times
um they're a good ball team they really are
oh wouldn't it wouldn't it though [laughter] wouldn't it oh my goodness we might actually get to go to a World Series huh
oh
yeah that's something you dream about [laughter]
oh oh there sure is and that i mean they really are um now Incaviglia i don't know how familiar you are with him but
last year i was kind of [noise] thinking he sure did get in a slump but they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really gonna come out of it and be on top
isn't he though he sure is he either hits home run or strike out there's not ever a in between for him
um-hum [noise] yeah
to sign him again yeah huh
yeah oh you you never know
that's sure if you offer them money i'm sure they'll do a little bit of everything [laughter]
no no no like that Joe Jo- -sego [laughter] you know i mean oh
i hadn't heard i- i really haven't um
oh yeah
well i hadn't either we hadn't you know like i said we ha- i don't even guess they've even thought about sending schedules out yet
yeah because we usually get one we usually order our tickets way in advance we we try to go so often
oh they do [noise] well i've enjoyed talking to you [noise] and [vocalized-noise] hopefully we'll get talk again okay bye-bye
real problem the last few days one of their uh young hopely stars has apparently ruined his knee for this season it was catcher
and they really don't have an excess of catchers and it's really kind of kind of late to you know to start be trying to trade for somebody
especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have
they're not the highest paying ball team around
but i you know i would i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys i'll tell you
yeah
that's right i really haven't been an active Ranger fan in several years i used to go take my son you know when he was in high school he enjoyed going to the baseball game
i'll have to admit i k- i kind of went more to s- to see the other team a lot of times than i did the did the Rangers but i think they're doing better
yeah
um-hum
yeah i can imagine
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid
i think it's more fun to play than it is to watch
yeah
oh of course
of course as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning he just pitched his
first uh exhibition game a day or so ago he pitched five [vocalized-noise] five full innings that was almost unheard of for a pitcher to you know to start out that strong
in cave no big deal you know it's just part of a days work he's something else he really is
they could do very well they sure could
um-hum
[noise] right
um-hum
yep they've got uh i guess all well all of their players are signed now some of them are not too happy about it but there's no there's no hold out
so that should help
yeah it should um-hum
oh yeah sure sure
um-hum Cincinnati
yeah there sure are
um-hum
um-hum that's right
i've never seen the Astros play
huh
um-hum
they tried
um-hum they sure are wouldn't it be something to have a World Series between Da- the Rangers and the Astros [laughter]
boy i tell you that would draw a crowd wouldn't it it sure would
that's right wouldn't that be something
sure would
absolutely
but there a lot of Ranger fans around
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
boy he's a bull isn't he [laughter] he really is gosh
um-hum that's right that's right he's kind of like Babe Ruth
yeah they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though apparently they i think his contract is up after the end of this year and they're not sure they're gonna be able to sign him again
yeah
that you know that may or may not happen
that's right it's a long way away
um-hum that's right that's right fortunate the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do
yeah that's right
is there gonna be a ticket increase this year price do you know
i haven't either
yeah the uh those Cowboys have increased their prices again this year
but i didn't know if i- i don't think i've heard anything on the Rangers or i don't remember it if i have
yeah
yeah i guess it's too early
um-hum it's a good idea yeah
um-hum yeah if you have young young children you know they they'd get a kick out of it um-hum
well you too Lori [noise]
right you take care -kay bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
you said you have four cats
how old are they
oh gosh
i haven't had my oldest one quite nine years i've had him probably five years yeah
oh yes i love my cats i lost one one time uh the first one i got he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment and he'd never been outside like you know by himself outside
and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a child had died i called everyone i knew i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical
oh yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
right the cat was here first so [laughter] i know it's hard
oh how funny
[laughter] that's sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats
and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and they're doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there
other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding
[laughter] i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him
but he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares
probably [laughter]
are they
oh no
oh my gosh
uh
i imagine
i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened
oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with
oh
oh my gosh
people are crazy
oh Lord
oh man
i imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it just seems to mellow them or something
no
oh yeah i ke- i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't i can't take care of them as well because they're outside and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back and
i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but i can't give them up i just i go hysterical when they don't come home [laughter] oh j-
oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours
uh-huh
ooh
really
[laughter] well it's here now we have to keep it yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely [laughter] so i found this one
in a actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens and i thought well that's interesting i'll call them and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens
and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers
yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so but he is the lovingest cat everybody people who don't even like cats like him
he never meows he he doesn't have any front claws i had him declawed but he doesn't bite anybody he's just he's just kind of there real friendly and docile
oh yeah
yeah we do we call that doing biscuits [laughter] it looks like their kneading bread [laughter]
oh i just love cats i like dogs they're okay i had i had a dog when i lived at home but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually
oh yeah
oh yeah they do
oh they are i love it it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities and they just act so funny
really
uh-huh
[laughter] a train of cats running around
[laughter]
oh how funny [laughter] i can imagine [laughter]
[laughter] yeah i wouldn't give anything for my cats i love them to death
what are your cats names
oh how sweet
i have Xanadu and Precious and Rascal
Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like nothing Precious is a medium hair yellow cat and Rascal is a black and white short hair
they don't look a thing a like [laughter]
and they came from the same litter and everything
oh
[laughter] so ugly she's cute right [laughter]
[laughter]
really
oh

yeah
really
oh i know it's like the end of the world
i know that's how i am about Xanadu
oh definitely
yeah [laughter]
you can walk a dog and that's okay for a weekend but cats are good all the time
it wouldn't have no that would be a problem [laughter]
[laughter]
have you seen those uh do you ever read Cosmo
there was a cartoon in Cosmo about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes you know they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up
and down at the bottom he said of course i love cats
and you know they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards it was so funny

oh well he lived through it oh i couldn't believe it we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now
and he's like oh thank you so much
i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too
uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip
oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks
of in and out of the vet and surgery
and tod- i mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him
[laughter]
but oh they he's been a wonderful cat

and but oh they're so much fun to watch them play it's just just hysterical
yes
oh we've got uh well the two that were outside
they're like brothers i mean i've never seen two cats so close and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats will follow in suit [laughter] it's like this train i under-

the whole family was so disappointed [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] right [laughter]
right uh but yes [vocalized-noise] we just just love them to death
[noise]
uh well
well it was nice talking to you too i enjoyed it
okay thanks bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
so where have you been where have you been camping before
oh yeah
[noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
naturally
good grief
yeah
that was a bad a bad place to be especially right there on the water at night especially if it i mean if it were summer you're all right because it probably wasn't too cold but uh probably the worst one that ever happened to me was in when i lived in South Dakota
um i was stationed at Ellsworth there at Rapid City
and it's right there at the Black Hills and i just absolutely love the Black Hills it's the greatest place in the world to go camping you throw a pack on your back and get up in the mountains
and you can understand how the Indians got real religious up there because it's just it's just awesome up there
so quiet and peaceful and the wind blowing through the trees and all that i had a favorite little camping spot i used to go to it was uh right next to a stream and all the streams of of course are mountain fed melted snow
so it's nice and ice cold a good place to keep your eggs and stuff and this little place was uh it was a per- a perfect circle of trees
it was almost like they were intentionally planted that way and i would camp right in the middle of this thing and it provided shelter and everything else it was just absolutely terrific well
the winters are pretty tough up there and right around March i start get cabin fever
and i say oh man i got to go camping so throw all the stuff in the car and of course being the careful camper that i am i carried my uh propane heater with me and a couple bottles of propane
and so i get my tent up and i get my fire place built and all that and i'm just having a good time and uh that night
it got down to seventeen degrees below zero and snowed
and i'm sitting in this tent in my sleeping bag freezing
so i said oh time to get this heater cranked up so i cranked up the heater and this things going of course i got it going full bore
i run out of propane so here it is about three o'clock in the morning and i've got to hike back to my car to get more propane
well across the stream there's a fallen log that you have to walk across to get into this little place
and i'm crossing over the top of this thing it's snowing the thing is slippery and of course i slipped and fell in
so at three o'clock in the morning i'm up to my neck in freezing ice cold water and i can just feel my heart just you know scrunch right up the size of a pecan
so i finally drug myself out of that i just got in the car and drove home i left everything sitting there i just got just got in the car went home got uh got a nice hot shower uh i got some dry clothes on and then went back
that was probably the worst thing that ever happened
[laughter] [vocalized-noise] it's fun though that that was i just absolutely loved it up there that whole part of the country was great went to uh Glacier National Park a couple of times and
Yellowstone Yellowstone is just too crowded though it's not a lot of fun with a whole bunch of people around and these stupid bears i mean they're almost tame they come up begging for hand outs you know course i'm
well that's true and and it's sad because now they they're so used to people they're going into the towns and raiding garbage cans and stuff and that presents a threat to the people living there and now they're having to shoot them
you know i mean it's sad because those those bears were doing fine until we got there you know and now they're now we're killing them because of something that some monster that we created
so i don't know it upsets me a little bit i like bears they're pretty they're pretty cool
yeah and to me Yellowstone was just too uh commercialized
i mean it it's it's got some areas that are really nice but i mean you get up there and everything is just you know you know souvenirs and all this kind of junk
and i i sort of i like the really raw land you know go out and where no man has gone before and that sort of thing
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
that's right there goes his battery
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i uh i used to uh when i was over in Guam i used to go out and just spend the night on the beach and go s- go scuba diving at night and
looking around
it was a lot of fun
yeah all the all the [noise] all the light pollution
yeah that was one good thing about the hills you could get up there and it was just it was crystal clear it was just beautiful you saw stars you never saw before great place i'd love to go back up there
maybe i'll get back up there one of these days
of course i'm in i'm in North Carolina now and and uh the mountains here are pretty nice i haven't been i just got here last September but i'm planning to
do a little camping trip this summer
get up there in the mountains and have a look we used to uh when i was in Alabama as a boy uh we used to have our YMCA retreats in uh
well i've been camping a number of uh of state parks as it were and one of the
the first ones that i ever went out with was with another group of people there were some uh college students uh
uh out on a camp out and there were probably ten or fifteen little tents strung in a row on a little peninsula sticking out into Lake Texoma
and the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be really out in the middle of
no where as far as wind breaks go and and we had secured tents real well even if we had done it in the dark at eleven o'clock at night
and uh oh i guess an hour into my
somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened
and i said okay i didn't you know was kind of groggy didn't know what was going on and crawled out of that tent and uh sure enough uh shortly after that they blew down so we're out here in the pitch dark in this wind and it starts to rain
and we managed to uh fortunately the rain didn't last long but we managed to get them all back up and uh got some sleep in that night and
after we got uh
back from the weekend we checked with one of the parents of one of the other college kids and they were a little concerned they had heard on the radio that the winds on the dam there anyway had gotten up to ninety seven miles an hour straight winds and
and we could believe that we were out in that at that time and it uh it can be quite a horror story i guess and i
yeah yeah
right it was summer
right yeah
[laughter]
um
[laughter]
[laughter]
huh
yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic [laughter]
oh
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah a couple of generations of you know being around people and boy there's nothing left of them as far as wildness goes
huh
that's true
right
yeah that's it's a shame to change a whole area so much like that
huh
yeah i uh uh i've been mainly with groups of people and uh sometimes with a family here and there a couple of families get together but mainly it college age kids and
uh on this one weekend where the tents blew down that same weekend we had one one college kid that yeah he thought he wanted to come and then when he got there it was a little more boring and you know that place doesn't have a whole lot to do up there
and uh he sat in his car most of the time and and uh listened to his tapes and fortunately he didn't keep them crank them up too loud but he uh he stayed in the car and did what he could have done at home as it were
and it was no surprise when Sunday rolls around and the car won't start and then you listened to tapes all weekend you know
it doesn't take much but uh we got him all back going and
packed up and came on back uh let's see i i had another another camp out that wasn't uh near as bad in fact it had some really good good points to it i'm trying to think of exactly where we were
uh we were on another lake i don't remember the the name of it but we were right up at the shore and the way it was layed out the camp grounds were
uh it was another state park and the campgrounds had railroad ties blocking off a sandy pit and that made for a fairly level place to put the tent
but to get down to the beach you had to walk down a real steep embankment i mean it was so steep they had put railroad ties as stair steps every once in a while mainly for the erosion and that became a path as it were
but the beach was beautiful we managed to comb out some of the broken glass and the like but the actual sand was a real good quality and real deep and we set up the old volleyball net and you know just a typical
uh twenty or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this this cove this beach was a bit of a cove
and it was surrounded oh i'd say a couple of hundred yards by uh this hill this mountainous uh rock terrain and only that little bitty section of it was actually beach the rest of it was water right up against the rock
so you pretty well had the whole area to yourself there were enough of us where we filled the whole peninsula as far as the the camping on both sides so we di- we all had to walk down to the one area to go down to the beach and it was pretty much the whole area to ourself
beautiful weekend however at that time at that stage in our life our kids were
were uh real young and one of them managed to catch diarrhea while we were there so we'd have to run him up the the hill and you know the little portable toilet was up there and
and uh it was a little bit to bulky to bring all the way down to the to the beach with us and we probably should have found some way to do that or
but uh and it was hot and we had a little trouble keeping ice it didn't last as long as we had planned so we had to buy that a little more often but uh the beach just couldn't uh couldn't have been any better a good place to dive for balls
yeah you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to uh be able to see the stars and uh we do that on the camp outs
yeah
yeah
huh
yeah
that's true
[noise]
yes
oh how awful
[laughter]
i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional
yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes [laughter]
uh the most recent movie i saw uh i'm afraid was uh well two two of them actually uh the Rain Man was one
wasn't that fabulous and and Driving Miss Daisy
oh you need to see that that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people
two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was Black and this all took place in the South and uh normally never the twain shall meet
yes right and um uh it it it really was a fantastic movie the acting was phenomenal
oh yes Jessica Tandy won best actress and uh say
[noise]
yes it did yes it did just as Rain Man uh with Dustin Hoffman
uh that that was tremendous and Tom Cruise
yes uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman
yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right there in Cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of Dayton
oh well we do have a Kmart here you better believe it isn't there a Kmart everywhere
yes
right right yeah
yeah
oh yes
[vocalized-noise] yes yes
well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things and everyone feels they are totally retarded
that's right
it's amazing [laughter]
yes
yes and the
right well the warmth that developed between them and again it i think was a picture of relationships
again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident
did you
yes
uh-huh
well that's tremendous that it's good because it does make you think about your own family
and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother
um-hum
uh [laughter]
[laughter]
well he at least saw it one time
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
well just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had
yes
[laughter]
[noise]
well i'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them
well it's just uh been delightful talking with you
absolutely i'm ready for it they're predicting some more snow for our direction [laughter]
take care now bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay Mary
um the uh the latest one i've seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um and it was uh it was called Manhunter actually
uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental dysfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people
uh just uh kill them with uh with as much blood and and guts as possible
it [laughter] was true it was truly awful it was not one that i picked but uh
uh it it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the FBI because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were FBI people and uh
uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the FBI about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they're looking for
before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that and it was uh uh it was was pretty telling about the the the FBI and and their procedures
yeah i- i- i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh going i guess [laughter]
yeah yeah
oh that was a great one
oh i loved it
you know i haven't seen that one yet and i need to go see it
yeah
uh-huh
oh my
um you bet especially in the South
but as
it it as i recall it got some Academy Awards didn't it
oh yeah that's right it it might have one best picture too
yeah
um-hum
that was
yeah i- i think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from Dustin Hoffman but uh
yeah it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff and
oh
is is the Kmart there [laughter] that was
that was so funny had to or was it Kmart uh he had to buy his underwear at Kmart
that was hilarious the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable
yeah yeah
yeah well because that's the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there's a lots going on in there [laughter]
yeah yeah and i the the i think the the best thing about Rain Man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease
a- only a- a- and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then ag- then again work with it toward a good end
not not toward you know winning in Las Vegas for example
yeah
yeah
right right i was uh i was so impressed with that movie i saw it three times i can i can s- tell you oh oh so much about that movie just because it it
it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background i i have a a brother myself that's
that's older and uh he's not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes
and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then
you know back and forth so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers that was neat
yeah a lot
um-hum no question he the he was he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that he likes the bang them up shoot them up things
[vocalized-noise]
and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it but uh oh boy he was
uh uh he he gave the the the best response that i've heard him give of this type of movie for Rain Man [laughter] i mean he he certainly didn't he only saw it one time and he didn't go back for more but uh but he he said he enjoyed it and and
yeah yeah yeah and and he really i don't know he he he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this i'm like oh come on [laughter]
yeah
it
and to make it believable i mean i was i- i was believing it i don't know about anybody else but i was it was great
[laughter]
he did great
yeah yeah you take care up there and uh [vocalized-noise] let's hear it for the summertime [laughter]
no oh no oh well take care
bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
[noise]
well go ahead i'll let you start [laughter]
uh-huh
right yeah
[noise]
um-hum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they ta- y- you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted it doesn't matter how rich you are [laughter]
that would be good
what'd you say
oh yeah [laughter]
uh
uh-huh
that's true
um-hum
well that's true the America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time
because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so you're really learning a skill
what'd you say
um-hum
[laughter]
[noise]
yeah i i think well that's probably the i- i don't know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country
[noise]
yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uh-huh
yeah that'd be sort of neat
yeah well i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare course that's what um that's sort of like what Truman had or or was it Roosevelt i can't remember um with the big
yeah
uh-huh
getting people or the wor- the work program and all the all the make work jobs that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building
what'd you say
yeah that's true a lot of them still out there like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why [laughter]
lake what
Caddo Lake
no never heard of it [noise]
oh [laughter]
[laughter]
oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah yeah oh okay yeah i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh
a Texan but i guess that's uh that's what we're going to have this is uh a TI experiment to see how talk Texans talk to other people
uh Virginia
oh yeah it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff
especially when it comes to um social services uh i- i- i'm glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services becau-
like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn't even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service
[noise]
politician is pushing it or uh
or Mitch Snider [laughter]
or Mitch Snider
oh okay well see that's a DC thing Mitch Snider is the the advocate for the homeless
that uh he he s- s- said it out here in Wa- uh Washington but he started the um uh [noise] the movement for creative nonviolence
yeah he started that and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless but uh
excu- uh the other topic was like i said uh [noise] something about politicians i can't remember exactly what it was it was a real general statement
[laughter] gee whiz [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh [noise] that would be neat
i'd have to basically say my birth yeah
um-hum well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know [laughter] yeah
cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the south would say don't burn coal you know
oh we have a lot of coal [laughter] but uh it's uh it's a dirty fuel that's for sure
[noise]
excuse me
how did i get into it oh i'm uh electrical engineer uh here in Virginia
no
uh no they i'm in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know
uh not really i mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else
but uh no no real association with TI other than being in the same industry
electronics industry
[noise]
they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they doe- do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study and
and since
i don't know no i don't
[noise]
um-hum
right
wha- [noise] what do you think what
[noise]
get [noise]
oh i don't know
[laughter] get your own
[laughter] yeah get your own T I seven four L S thirty two or something what was it
a little chip
oh yeah i didn't hear about that probably for TI employees yeah
oh oh you're not you don't work for Texas Instruments oh okay
oh
oh
oh that's a neat idea uh-huh
yeah well he's gotten a good mix i i was saying because i've like i said i heard some other people talking they've talked to different people in different states and stuff
that's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so so probably knock TI's profits margin way down
yeah right this is probably some government study program
okay
okay well i enjoyed talking with you
i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes she's diving into
[laughter]
okay we'll i'll talk to y- bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter] uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people
uh be required to do s- public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you can't make it everybody
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way
too
[laughter] and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right
give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass
[laughter]
uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money
and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they c- could subsist
yeah
yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what cou- we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes
[laughter] and they could do public service all over the country i'm just teasing
[laughter]
well i thought it'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too
a trade off
yeah
and other than that i can't think of any other ideas
oh with WPA
yeah
and we're still using those things too
we're still using those things
[laughter]
they built lodges before too like at Caddo Lake
Caddo Lake
it's between Texas and Louisiana
it crosses into both of them well it's real pretty it's like a swamp you know with all the Spanish moss on the trees it's really it's eerie [laughter] yeah
[laughter] i don't know where are you from
Virginia oh that's neat i talked to somebody from Ohio the other night
um-hum
there is somebody and i r- uh i can't remember who it is but there's a really famous [noise]
of dang i can't remember his na- yeah [noise] that proposed it i read something in People about it huh Mitch Snider i don't know who Mitch Snider is
yeah
so what have your other topics been
i had one that i hated it was what meal would you cook for uh a special dinner [laughter] i mean how far can you go with that one right and another one though that was good was uh
what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems
that have been it's probably the best one
and we had to talk about air pollution too
what do you think's causing it and what should we do about it
uh-huh right
it's because we don't have much coal
in Virginia
yeah
well how'd you get into this program
how'd you get into this program
for TI
no
so does your company have something to do with TI
hum um-hum
and do you know how mu- how long this is supposed to go on
tha-
i don't either i mean it says just keep on until and they'll notify you at first i was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows
you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week
so what do you think we're going to get
what do you think we're going to get for this
yeah money prizes
[laughter] do you know anybody that's ever done this
[laughter]
[laughter] i know TI gets prizes
and i was led to believe that if you weren't TI that you get money i'm not TI
huh-uh
let's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing
and i just signed up for it
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter] and it shouldn't be too good right now anyway because they've been laying off so many people
yeah really [laughter] so we're footing the bill on our taxes
okay well thanks a bunch we'll talk to you later bye
well i'm going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour [laughter] see if we can walk around okay bye
[noise]
[noise]
our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive
i live in San Antonio
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah there's there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio i used to work for the power company here and there was discussion
for a while about uh building a garbage burning
uh electric generation plant but it just wasn't cost effective at the time
and there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn't any um [noise]
advertising campaign there's just not any push to recycle i recycle my newspapers and uh alumi- my aluminum stuff
but uh
they make it as hard as possible it's just not very convenient to do
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
yeah where i work now we recycle all the computer paper
but that's about the extent of it
yeah yeah
and i'm sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so [vocalized-noise] we sell the paper back to
the uh to a paper manufacturing company
well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think i not by much but it does defray it some
enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building
yeah
yes
yeah
well the last time uh
someone moved offices in my building and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around
i- i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes and they were just going to throw them away
yeah
hum-um
right and and these boxes are you can unfold them
so you know there they don't take up much storage space
yeah yeah i- i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so
and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them
yeah
um-hum
yeah the ones at the grocery store half the time they've pulled the lid off so you can't use it anyway
those uh and the uh real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes
those are
those are perfect boxes to put files in [laughter]
what
what i've done in the past i don't have any now but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids
and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
yeah well [vocalized-noise] you know it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever
um-hum
yep
[laughter]
yes
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i live near a WalMart and there's a big uh uh
huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front in fact i think there's two of them and that have several openings
and it's for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category i don't maybe there's two for aluminum
and you don't get paid but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum it gets to be uh i guess you have to make it a habit i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit
um-hum
oh
[noise] and someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags
um-hum
yeah
well i've enjoyed talking to you
well
thank you bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
where do you live
San Antonio
well um i live in Garland and we're just beginning to
[noise] we we just built a real big recycling center [noise]
that recycles everything imaginable but
as far as that um
trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing
they're testing that so they're really not full
full force into it but they're trying so we're attempting it
but i wish we could do more
um-hum
oh
huh
right that's what i do
[laughter]
right where they put the centers and stuff like that
yeah uh well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i don't know if you all have those around
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center
and you can just stop by now [noise] everything else like the tra- um
[noise] paper and
plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but
but for aluminum that's real nice and i started doing that at work [noise] um i put out a
a trash can and you know for people to put their aluminum cans in
and that's really helped a lot i mean everybody's pitched in and
you know it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can
so i really really like that but people are really concerned it's just that sometimes it's not the right people
which is really really sad
because i wish we would do more [noise] at work we started
um
all the recycling stuff they're really trying i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing that we had last year
and um that really started a lot of stuff off but
you know sometimes it dwindles down
that's good
well that's well at least your trying something
it's just yeah it would be nice if it could be more
oh do you really
well that's a neat idea
uh-huh [noise]
right
sure
well that's that's really good i mean at least they're trying
yeah i know a lot of companies that waste so much that
i'm even trying you know that was one thing we noticed last week that
we had some new people move into our building
and [vocalized-noise] you know the nice cardboard boxes that you m- packing boxes
and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and i thought
i don't understand this you know we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff and
and here we are wasting and i don't understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it
uh-huh
[laughter]
that's exactly what i did
that's exactly what i did exactly because i didn't want to waste that and it's hard enough to find good packing boxes though
right
that's exactly right well that's very good [laughter]
uh
right right i found about
i found about five um about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes
that were in the dumpsters and i was like oh gosh so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes
when you know these are perfect so
[vocalized-noise] right
right [noise] right
uh-huh
right
that's exactly what i do
uh-huh [noise]
they're [vocalized-noise] good for storage and stuff like that that's what i do with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her [noise]
you know her like her out dated cards or out of out of season clothes in them and they're just perfect
uh-huh
and they look just as good that's a smart idea [vocalized-noise]
i think i have to try that that's really cute
and now they
they're the exact same thing
that's all they are they just made them look fancy
save you some money [noise]
and you're recycling [laughter]
well that's neat well do you all have um
we have
places that um
[noise] pay for paper
to recycle i know you do yours at work but for newspaper
but ours are real hard to find that's the one thing that really discourages me i saved pa- you know i recycle paper
but they
it's almost like they don't want the paper because they don't pay
at all i mean they're real hard to find the places that pay and that's really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it's
you know they just accept it
but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think it's a
you know like the aluminum you know it gets people to uh doing it you know you might you don't have to pay them a lot
um-hum
uh
uh-huh
well that's that's good
that's good i the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is um
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper
and one for just your normal trash [noise] but in uh
in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines
you can't throw any of that away and you can't throw
certain file type things away and i just think it's such a hassle it seems like it would be
it'd be easy to take it all i don't know of course i don't know all that about
recycling so
probably it's a hassle but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know we're
right
right we had uh a write up in our paper [noise]
uh this last time at work about um
they come and you empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin
and when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late or we didn't have time to do those bins or something
and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it and then they
right right so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about
you know separate them because that is discouraging when you
when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans
but luckily that'll all get straightened out and
and they'll they'll start separating them because i don't mind doing that i feel like i'm doing uh
doing something for the community when i'm doing that
but anyway
you too
bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh the last movie that i saw i i don't go to that many so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was Awakenings with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro
have you seen it
it is i just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro he is one of the best actors i've ever seen it's
there's a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less
but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all
and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor
though
no it was very serious very ser-
he's good he's he's talented boy he is
i know me too but uh well what was that show um
[noise]
Gar- uh Garf-
i want to say Garfield but that wasn't
[noise]
yeah The World According to Garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he
[noise]
i did too [laughter] and that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part but
yeah right
well what have you seen
[noise] oh i saw it
[laughter]
yes the whole way
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise] where did you cry
um-hum
uh-huh yeah yeah
[laughter]
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed
oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him
and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know [noise] and that horse has been such a pal to him
[noise]
when he was [noise] alone
you can tell i'm an animal lover you can hear my dog [laughter]
yeah
it was a beautiful story it really was
um-hum um
oh i thought it was awful
and so graphic i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know i think we've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo
um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie of course they raise them now you know to eat
but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that
no it wasn't [laughter]
oh yeah
yeah really
really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing
i know
yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie
it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real
i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves
yeah right they just don't howl that much anymore
i could they c- bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
well i think we've made it
i don't know is it five or three
i'm not either
okay me too
well thank you [vocalized-noise]
yeah you too bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
yes uh-huh
no unfortunately i haven't i heard it's really good but
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is
oh how does he do serious stuff
yes y- i've only seen him in funny stuff and so
yeah uh Garp The World of Garp
i didn't read see the the movie i read the book but i
yeah
yeah
yeah in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so
yeah
i think the last movie that we went out to see was Dances With Wolves
uh well good we've both seen one [laughter] did you cry through much of [laughter]
i was telling a friend i- i said i only cried twice but each was about half an hour long so
[laughter]
um let's see when i each time that i thought that the Indians were going to get killed i cried um i cried the first time when the um
the wagon man got killed when they attacked him
and um i think from there on [laughter] [vocalized-noise] through the movie let's see what else did it
um
what other parts i can't remember any of the other parts right yeah
we- i don't remember when the horse got killed
oh yeah yeah
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
uh unfortunately we don't have any animals so
um
but [vocalized-noise]
it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes
that was
yeah
um-hum
oh
oh [laughter]
uh-huh yeah that's not
um-hum
[noise]
yeah well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in
um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful like that was great and there were so many of them i didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place
so that was pretty
um-hum
yeah
i wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast i guess they graze though that wouldn't -ve been a problem
no huh-uh
um-hum
oh
i guess they're just not
domesticated or or
huh
[laughter]
that'll teach them with a couple minutes huh [laughter]
well that's funny
yeah
oh is that five minutes is that
okay
oh i'm not sure
okay well i think we're we're we've done okay though well thank you for calling
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] hope you enjoy some more good movies late-
bye bye
[noise]
well uh she said uh one was a total ban on gun control and ten was uh no control at all where do you fit in there
oh is that right well we're probably not too far apart i'd probably fall in there at a seven or eight
well i pretty much agree with that that's uh
um-hum
uh-huh
is that right in the whole state
golly well the
they're now criminals themselves yeah that's that's the crazy thing about it you're you're putting
[vocalized-noise] they're they're putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on the honest citizen the one who doesn't give them a problem anyway
[vocalized-noise] you know and it's it's crazy they're just putting more
giving more paper work problems to the honest citizen and and you know because uh a person whose gonna use a gun for a crime he's he's not too concerned with the crime of not registering his gun
that's [vocalized-noise]
yeah i- i would agree with that that you kn- well you know that's that's why i say i kind of fall into a seven or eight range there you know i i don't have a problem with registration
but uh you know when it comes to restrictions and and
yeah yeah i- it is crazy because
like you say this country was founded uh and obviously had a uh had a big interest in in letting them their citizens arm themselves
and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws don't have but it's one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think
yeah yeah [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
yeah th- [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah everybody who lives out in the country or or around around my area everybody who lives out in the country has a gun
yeah you know and it's not for uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun it's no big deal
but bu-
yeah
i am in uh Trenton Texas did you yeah did you say you were in California
well i
well i didn't know this program reached out that far
all right well that's that's a neat deal
[vocalized-noise] oh i bet we have we gave them a few minutes worth
all right you too good night the- bye bye
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
well i think you'd probably have to put me at the at the ten area ten or nine
yeah i uh i just you know it's it's you know wea- weapons obviously do not kill it's the people that operate them and
with with two hundred years of uncontrolled gun control in this country i mean it was founded on that it was one of the things that founded this country i can't imagine trying to to do that and if you pass laws you're gonna make a lot of
criminals criminals because people wouldn't register them i i i live in California and and we just had a a registration a law registration for automatic guns and uh
[noise] they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this state and less than ab- i think fifteen hundred people registered them
yeah
yeah in the whole state
so what is happened now is that those people that did not register them are um
they're now criminals
[vocalized-noise]
no no no
absolutely you know it's like i- i- i- i i don't really quite understand the idea that people think that
[vocalized-noise] i mean i i'm all for registration in the sense that uh a a a lawful person can go down and get a gun an- and maybe you shouldn't be given one the day that you go down they should be able to do a check i think possibly an-
y- yeah
yeah and and just plain can't have guns
oh absolutely not only that but i think there's also a hidden a hidden wealth in in in the citizen having firearms and that hidden wealth is is that i would really
i would really feel sorry for anybody for a country that that tried to physically invade this country
mean because you know it's it's a country where everybody has a gun and they're gonna have some trouble [laughter] i mean you know in the mom and pop little towns and stuff they're gonna run into people with guns
a- an- that that is sort of a hidden security factor i think for this nation you know i mean
sure
[vocalized-noise] at least one
[noise]
it's that's the way they just brought up we- uh where're you from by the way
Texas [laughter]
yeah i'm in California right now i'm i'm originally from North Carolina though i
hey it's reaching all over
[vocalized-noise] well listen you think they've earned their money we've earned our money tonight
[laughter] all right well listen you take care of yourself all right
good night all right [noise]
[noise]
well Jerry do you have a favorite team
Cowboys
okay well they're rebuilding right now yet i think it's going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team
right
i think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this uh past year
okay
yeah
okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like they're going to do all right
my
yeah big shoes to follow [laughter] well my favorite team is a is a sentimental favorite uh the Green Bay Packers i grew up in that area and have been following them
been following the Packers ever since uh they won the first two Super Bowls
yeah they sure did i remember those
yeah i actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl
they could have had a good year this year uh unfortunately the quarterback uh controversy they had where Don McCowskey got hurt and couldn't play most the season
they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract [noise]
so i don't know if he's going to be in shape to
uh-huh
who did you root for in the Super Bowl
yeah both New York teams
uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game
i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they're going to they're showing some real promise for the next uh few years
the Giants are always uh always there perennially a good team
i think they had a lot of luck there too with Montana getting hurt in San Francisco
i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldn't have been much of a contest
yeah i think it's getting better more competitive
uh we see uh teams getting in the play-offs every now and then with uh five hundred records or a little below even
the uh AFC Central is a lot like that with uh Pittsburgh Cincinnati Cleveland and Houston nobody really dominated that division last year at all
right
okay i wasn't living here then so i can't talk much about that [laughter]
right
well there's no doubt about that the money's there and the owners are willing to pay if unfortunately uh and you get star players like uh like Joe Montana making four million dollars a year and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now
and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans
uh it's no wonder ticket prices are so high
i don't go to games myself uh uh
no you you really can't not when it costs twenty six dollars a ticket and uh so much for parking
sure
yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment
sure
yeah it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can out of this deal uh he's got his own TV show and he opened the Cowboy Corral out in in the parking lot there
and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that
i think there's still a lot of distrust for uh for an Arkansas man to come here and own uh uh Tex- a team in Texas
and uh i don't think that's going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback
yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really
really didn't need that type of uh player
yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's going to be interesting to see what they do with them
so hopefully we'll see some more improvement
and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they're they're getting uh older uh they're going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that's an older team and they're going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too
looks like we'll reach a point of uh parity there where the Cowboys may start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams
i don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see
yeah he's uh one of those guys you love to hate
kind of like uh Jerry Glanville
yeah they they do pick up the image of a team though uh and they create a lot of excitement locally so i think they're good for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different attitude
but uh they're not my favorite people either
uh-huh
well Buddy will probably get another job
oh he's great i saw him play when he as at uh UNLV he was not only the quarterback but the punter and he can punt the ball sixty yards no problem
he's a very good athlete that is true
uh-huh
yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short
no
i like the team i really really like the Eagles a lot but uh Buddy Ryan [laughter] is not one of my favorite people so i wasn't too disappointed to see them lose
i don't think he's going to get a head coaching job this next year
he'd be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace
um he's just one of those guys he's created such a controversy in Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now
i'm sure he will he's not going to have problems there if not in the NFL then in one of the other leagues
the World Wide Area Football League WWAFL or whatever they call it WWAFL
yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh
uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players
not only that but they don't pay the money either
uh it's very low uh scale compared to the NFL
right well some people i'm sure the the more talented people in that league are going to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league
possibly but that's that's uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they're going to get drafted and make a pro team there aren't going to be too many people that that'll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF
it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA
some guys can come back and play in the NBA but most of them don't really don't have the physical skills or the talent
i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah uh the of course the Dallas Cowboys yeah
yeah i live live and die with them
yeah yeah
yeah uh of course
i guess really the reason i like the Cowboys is because
SMU was my favorite team uh col- [noise] pardon me college team and of course they started out with Don Meredith
and uh
so that that tie there between SMU and the Cowboys
yeah uh Jerry Johnson surprised me
i didn't think he was going to do very good because i thought he was a college football coach and not a professional coach
yeah
yeah course he he came after a legend too Tom Landry so he had some uh tough row to hoe there
yeah
yeah
[noise]
pardon my for coughing i've been coming down with a cold
yeah
they used to have some uh
bang up fights and dig in the trenches with the Cowboys the Ice Bowl and
the other uh
games that they would play for the Super Bowls
yeah
at uh
they had they had some good teams though
yeah
yeah
yeah
an- course they were they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after Lombardi who could fill his shoes
but uh
i i didn't really have a favorite in the Super Bowl i just wanted to see a good game
i i was tired of blow outs
and it it was it was good to see a good good uh championship game
yeah
yeah well their coach has a lot to do with that i think
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
but uh there's a lot of parity now compared to what it used to be
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah another one of my favorites was in the old uh AFL or the uh uh American Football League the Dallas Texans when they started
in fact they were they out drew the Cowboys there for quite a while
yeah
but uh
but some of these some of the uh i get a little disappointed sometime with with uh
players now days compared with the old players it seems like most the players today are
are playing for the money rather than the the uh
fun and for the uh competition that used to be in the older days
uh
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
i can't afford to go to them
nah you you take
yeah you take just two just a man and wife by the time you pay the tickets
the parking
uh any kind of refreshments or anything there you can spend a hundred dollars right quick
and not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend
yeah
yeah
and also i don't like the deal uh with the uh Cowboys stadium
where that you to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket
the only seats they have available are in the end zone
yeah
yeah
yeah
but that's that's true just about eve-
yeah
hum yeah
yeah
yeah if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him before he
yeah
yeah and i you know i think defense really is what wins
wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don't have any blocking maybe they can't do anything
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah wha-
uh
i don't know i i have mixed emotions about him
uh sometimes i like him but at the same times i love to see somebody beat him
because he's got a mouth on him
yeah
man you love to hate
yeah
yeah
but um
but he yeah to me he's just like the Yankees you just
you love to see someone beat him
but um
they do have a good team
yeah and i think old uh i think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback
yeah
yeah
yeah i imaging he could play just about any position on the team except maybe a defensive lineman but he's a very excellent athlete
yeah
well i don't they uh the games they lo- lost i don't think they lost by any blowout i think they were all close games
no
i i'm wondering where he's going to wind up
um
yeah
yeah
but uh he'll he'll wind up somewhere
yeah i'm kind of interested how this new uh league's going to summer league's going to fare
World Football League
yeah
yeah
yeah
the way people talk about uh there's not that it won't be as good as the NFL will because uh there's not that many good or quality football players i can't believe that
yeah but uh
but uh i still think there's plenty of good football players around that just
were not able to get on the NFL because the NFL's teams were just full
yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
but uh
i'm i'm looking forward to the season i think it's going to be fun yeah
[noise]
uh probably uh in the last few weeks the biggest uh way i've had of keeping up with what was going on in the Gulf was CNN and i think maybe that's probably true for everyone
oh
well we get we get the
first you know it comes directly to us from CNN and it's a continuous coverage and course they repeat themselves a lot [noise] and it was really easy when
as we said well nothing's happening in the war because now they're interviewing the what seems to be dozens of Mideast experts all at once
hm
a little much yes we have uh we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift
um-hum
so you are off to work this morning
oh you're at work oh i assumed that these were home telephone numbers
[noise] uh we also get a Chicago uh paper and course that's where our main coverage as far as world events are concerned our local paper is just current events
in our town of five thousand we have one that is uh local FM AM station and their news is fed from CNN too uh it's more of uh
oh call in for a trading post type thing and uh the fi- music from the fifties and uh [noise] it's i guess what you'd expect from a farming community
um-hum
hm
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
i only watch one soap opera a day and it seems to me and that's probably about once every two months since my husband retired it seems to me so often times that they cut into that soap opera
with what i don't really consider as earth shaking i guess maybe i think sometimes the uh the coverage is almost too intent
um-hum
you mean when the reporter sticks the the microphone in the person says the face and says how do you feel that you house has burned to the ground
that's a bit much isn't it
[laughter]
um-hum
[noise]
i guess maybe they have so much time to fill i've thought often times that maybe our world was a little bit better place when i was in high school and the wor- and the news like your radio station was on
fifteen minutes in the evening and then they went on to i don't know i think the Andy Williams show or something that filled up the other fifteen minutes of that half hour and we just weren't so heavy with it
well it's sure been nice visiting with you
we're having sleet and rain in Indiana this morning so
oh well have a good day then [laughter] bye-bye
[noise]
okay
well let's see
right uh we don't uh get that in uh straight fashion but you know the other major channels have been carrying a lot of it so i've seen a good bit of their coverage
uh-huh
right oh they've really done uh good job of keeping everybody informed of what's going on sometimes i've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know [laughter]
uh-huh
well our um newspaper does a pretty good job on most things but you know its uh not totally in depth and quite frankly i didn't read all of the war stuff
you know it was just there were too many long article and i try to quickly read through the paper before work in the morning so i don't don't get to spend a lot of time on everything
[vocalized-noise] i'm at work yes
uh-huh
what about your uh radio stations do they uh provide much in the way of current event stuff
[noise]
uh-huh well i've lived in a small town before and was quite aware of the local radio station at that time and i know how they are
well ours uh that we
tend to listen to most um i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll have you know five minutes worth of news every half hour
but in the middle of the day they don't just drown you with the same old stuff and they won't interrupt unless it's you know really important
and and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff but they didn't just over do it
yeah
i think so i- i don't really think we
need to know or even sometimes care so much about all the little nitty-gritty things they keep asking over and over i think think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions
[laughter] yeah [laughter] things like that are just kind of absurd or once in a while they'll they'll keep uh just hounding someone that they're interviewing
and there seems to be no purpose um you know the person has stated you know some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they just keep on and on and on
uh-huh
yeah
well you too
oh well we're having sunshine i think it's gonna be up in the seventies today so
you too [vocalized-noise] good-bye
[noise]
[noise]
the um [noise]
uh you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman how women have changed uh look at them in England
Margaret Thatcher was prime minister uh Indira Gandhi uh in India so many uh women are heads of state
and i you know we we keep saying oh yes we feel someday a woman will be president
but i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that i think we'll have a black president b- before we have a woman president
and uh i don't know that that's bad or good it's just a point that i have observed that we
yes
right
[noise]
uh oh uh oh i think we're s- we're supposed to hang up [vocalized-noise]
yes [noise]
[noise]
alrighty thank you bye-bye
[noise]
back by that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
yeah i- i- yeah i- i- i truly believe that that before that that we have to address the racial racial issues in the United States before we can go anywhere
um because it is so you know it [laughter] a friend of mine wen- traveled to Belize [noise] and [noise] and into Honduras hello
yeah well it wasn't the matter of wealth it was the matter that they were not wealthy [noise] that made them equal well i'll talk to you later okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[noise] okay uh could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution
[noise] um well
you talked about uh volcanos i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do
uh put into the atmosphere [noise] i think probably the greatest cause is uh
[noise] vehicles
especially around cities um uh do you live right in the city itself
[noise] uh okay so can can you notice well it's it's i live in a rural area
uh it's mainly farms and [noise] uh no heavy industry uh Attleboro itself i live in Rhode Island
and it's in the north i live up in the uh northeast corner [noise] and Attleboro sits in just over the line
where TI's plant is but there isn't a lot of heavy industry there's the freeways and we get an occasional w- it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston because we're only like about forty miles south of Boston so we'll pick up that
and uh i've noticed
over the past say maybe five or six years uh we live
about twenty miles away from the state airport and i notice the fly patterns now of the jets are they getting bigger they're swinging wider so that now they're coming over the over the our homes [noise]
and it seems like uh um we're catching all their residue i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping
but other than that you know we don't have the unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions [noise] -eah from the power plants
um
[noise] yeah yeah we generate one of ou- ou- biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to uh generate electricity um
there doesn't seem to be much emission from them but i'm not sure about the rest of the country
[laughter] is that right [laughter]
[laughter] y- y- y- yeah surprise surprise [laughter]
yeah them there must be uh um some of the some of the uh
[noise] uh larger plants up a- up around one twenty eight [noise] um we've got reports that uh during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from uh th-
the boilerhouse for powerhouses and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them
so you're right they could do something a- about that i guess
[noise] how are your uh
your lakes and uh
they have
acid rain yeah that's that's what i was uh
yeah no didn't they just have an article oh on uh [noise] they were dumping lime up upstate New York somewhere
um over over huge areas and and they thought that was more beneficial because you know and it some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away into the into the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
i can't remember where i i read that recently somewhere and i can't remember where but i thought it was up there [noise] so that's interesting because New Hampshire
[noise] and parts of Vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain [noise] um
do you kind of think it's something else then
oh they didn't say they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was
hm natural disease
yeah yeah
uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing i still think that's that's uh one of our major causes of pollutants
[noise] uh how we go about that it's uh uh it's a little bit difficult
yeah you n- you n- i think you need a a uh vehicle something like uh
uh Ralph Nader uh Nader's Raiders or uh where uh [noise] or uh [noise] uh AARP
which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups
yeah
they're better but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there uh whe- when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch
smoke or uh or
uh
i'm not really sure you think that that the uh the trucking indus- uh industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldn't
you know fuel is is one of their biggest costs
so you would
yeah diesel engines
yeah
[noise] yeah we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems uh this country seems to be a little behind on that
hm
yeah but only because we got used to [noise] uh
single person single car driving a lot of people don't even like to carpool
but we could do that that'll help
pollution air pollution [noise]
the uh United States and Canada are i guess is is uh it going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what's being given out by power plants
i guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there
so that's helping
now that's an idea
don't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your [laughter] tailpipe generate [noise] generate revenue
that's a that's an interesting concept is that your idea
well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you c- you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but
yeah if you can take a muffler off and only replace well not unless it was built into every muffler
and that's [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
that's a that's quite a concept
you should uh pursue that i think or patent it [laughter] you know
if you could come up with a device that's the thing
but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that but that's a that's a thought no you're right and that will solve uh a lot of problems i don't know if you uh
if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
uh but
you know a proposal to uh uh
i guess the proper authorities well you might uh generate some
yeah you might generate some interest in it but that's a that's a good idea other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
well it's hard to say i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you
look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all
what do you think
um-hum
uh no i'm more out in the suburbs but i certainly work near a city
how about you
um-hum
um-hum
oh i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
don't you mean like from the coal
[noise] hm
yeah i've noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible
uh what's coming out of your [noise] smokestack they do all their emissions at night uh so people get up
yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars [laughter] which you know seems to be
yeah i mean i really think if the EPA had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh
you know
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah
yeah that seems a little ridiculous
oh they've been getting cleaner
sure but um
yeah i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain yeah
i mean the stuff i've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit
um overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all um yeah i'm not an expert
hm
i haven't read that
oh yeah
um-hum
you know it's interest-
um-hum
hm
well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article so that
they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work
um
yeah so it's it's less than clear like i said i don't remember the article that well
but um i don't know i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution
um-hum
so you think it's just up to individuals to ask automakers for uh [noise] less polluting vehicles
yeah
um-hum
do you really think new vehicles though is a
big problem i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's the older polluters the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly it's hardly anything
yeah but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune
right
but diesel engines
i- you know it's it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
yeah on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah sure
well what do you think about like a device a meter o- right on a tailpipe and you paid a tax based on how much you polluted
well it just means that if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it it um i mean you could you could probably devise them so that it slowly closed off your tail pipe
[noise] and uh the less you pollute the longer the device lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tailpipe and you couldn't start your car anymore [noise]
yeah but uh you know [noise] it's uh
i guess the difficulty would be to [vocalized-noise] somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so you'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something [noise]
right
you could take catalytic but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
right
but if you were -st talking about something which was more or less universal that uh buses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax
um this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
[laughter]
yeah patent it that's a good idea
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the automobile regulatory agencies or some-
um-hum
[noise]
okay so uh do you own a PC
but you have one at work
okay and now because um [noise] see i'm doing my uh Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering
and um and i don't i don't have one but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad
you you use um like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk
because um the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data
that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame
oh okay
but does it have uh like a disk drive
oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't y- y- the only way that you can do it is through a modem
and you you know you just
do it that way but that's uh that's the only way that you can get to through to the system you can't store it anywhere
oh okay
and then you also have to do all your grading on the PC
oh okay
okay
yeah
well uh for us it's uh uh you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes
and presentations we use like for example a Macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the P- than you know the IBM PC's or anything compatible with that
due due to the fact that well you know i- i haven't tested the the PS two yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line
use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster
and uh you also get you know when you see it on the Macintosh with you know the one i have that doesn't have any color you can look at it and that's the way it's going to print out
and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen
and so
with you know with the IBM what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
and also you know it's like for for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers
and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets
you can see what the trend is over the years
yeah that
that i- i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error
instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um
uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right
get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four
so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time
and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that uh we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout
every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background
di-
did you learn it in computer science
and when was this
oh okay
yeah i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven
they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in
so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God they're still using this it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know [laughter]
you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it
so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started
they said that uh cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever
[laughter]
so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the Yugo you know it's like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away
and that that that's the way it would be you know it's like
yeah i think i'll buy a new car today you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean IBM which um
an IBM PC in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars
and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because uh you know because of the parts basically you know what
yeah
the the parts and the labor is what they're charging you they're not charging you you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know it's like we want to sell it to break even at least
and i think they stopped producing the IBM PC
and uh and the uh PC Junior was a total failure
to them they had uh they're trying to get out small computers but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the IBM PC [laughter]
and so you couldn't you know it's like sure bring out [vocalized-noise] into the market something that's smaller when no- nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know and so
but over the past years IBM has been producing uh like every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the P C B X T D A T and the PS one PS two things you know and so
it's just that you have to always compete and uh Macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools
because of of their you know you can work with it a lot easier
so that's what they're trying to do oh well
i'll leave you back to your work and uh have a good lunch all right bye bye
[noise]
um no not personally but yes uh-huh yeah several [laughter]
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
right right yeah i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home but it's one that the company has loaned me and that that's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um
um computers that i have up here and you know do work from home
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
right uh-huh
right
right
yeah
right yeah no i um i- i have both because that that's what i use all the time is Unix systems um versus the DOS but then i teach DOS classes uh at night uh-huh part time so
well that that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't uh i don't have to have grade any grades no grade books so that's great
[laughter]
but uh no i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect and um also for my spread sheets um so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
right
um-hum
right
right
that's true that's true
uh-huh
oh um-hum
um-hum
oh um-hum
what a hassle yeah yeah
um-hum
yeah
right yeah
um-hum
right right
yeah and i love all the windows that they have out now too they have really simplified things
right right
right
uh-huh
um-hum
[laughter]
yes
yes
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right right yeah i know i uh i remember my college days [laughter] and having to do that too
oh yeah uh-huh [noise] i sure did
uh i graduated in eighty six
yeah so it's been fairly recent
the cards
ah dear i didn't have to bother with that at all thank goodness yeah
yes
wow wow
uh-huh wow
uh-huh
oh that would be great [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
wow
[laughter]
oh sure oh sure
right yeah and the two eighty six too so yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
[laughter]
yeah oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's true
well
okay
thanks [laughter] bye
[noise]
[noise]
so what kind of eating out do you prefer do you like
uh-huh
oh really
things that don't cost too much but you get your money's worth
uh-huh but don't don't you
yeah but don't don't you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime
something with uh a cuisine that's a little bit you know more sophisticated like an Italian or French restaurant or something like that
uh-huh
yeah
well i- i personally don't like to go to Italian restaurants because i'm Italian and
well not really because you know i li- i live here in a dorm i- i still go to college but
i- i kind of don't eat Italian food if unless i go home because my mom cooks Italian food and it's like you know the you know she i- i think that she cooks the best so there's no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something that's just not as good [laughter]
yeah [noise] but you know i also like the [noise] the fast food places like Taco Bell because you can get a lot of food for cheap prices [noise]
yeah fifty nine cents yeah
so you knows
yeah it's it's something that you know w- we go there every Sunday [noise] me and my roommate go there every Sunday you know with our hangover
from Saturday and we go to uh Taco Bell and get the tacos you know it's some- it's it's cheap you don't have to spend a lot of money
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh okay
yeah bye
[noise]
uh i don't know uh medium priced restaurants usually [noise] not anything too nice because we have a four year old
so i usually like things that cater to children
yeah and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too it doesn't bother the other people
lots of fast food too i hate to admit it but
oh yeah yeah then we go to someplace nicer quieter
um-hum [noise] yeah there's uh Biraporetti's is one of our favorites it's real nice it's Italian
it's nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion
what do you like to do
[laughter] so that's just like everyday food for you huh
oh
hm
yeah hers probably would be the best
oh yeah thirty nine cents or whatever for those little tacos yeah my son likes those yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah and it tastes pretty much i mean i like the way i- it taste good and it's fast i like that too
[noise] well i hate to cut this short but i think i better get back to work
so thanks for calling bye [noise]
[noise]
okay what do you like to cook
[noise] uh-huh
um-hum
that'd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party
uh-huh
really
that sounds good
ooh fattening [laughter]
[noise] um we it's funny that um we're talking about this we just had a dinner party and we had um our senior pastor and his wife came over
and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn't something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with Anduille
y- you know sausage because i'm from New Orleans originally and um i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff
and um [noise] a salad and then for desert i w- i would i really wanted to make um
just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i don't know why
i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have but
um that's what i wa- that's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but
kind of like the Italians it's really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and
um it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared
right
[noise] i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain
because i guess i guess i feel like um if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that
but if it's just another couple came over um couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um
oh i can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday
i can't believe that anyway but um aft- when Ricky and Carrie came over
we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but
you know when we're having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler [laughter] and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don't think we gained any weight from it so [laughter]
um-hum
[noise] right i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didn't eat it
but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies
so um [noise] i got a good brownie recipe [laughter]
but uh anyway so i guess that's about what i do when i entertain
so do you have anything else you want to say about it or
okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye
[noise]
i like [noise] well i like to cook foods i like to eat i like to eat Italian food best and i find that i that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it's one dish meals type things and they're kind of convenient
right
um i usually have parties that are smaller groups i don't have i've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such
and so um y- uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy sauces and um
noodles and pasta and such
[laughter] yeah actually [laughter] how about you what do you like to to cook
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
[noise] oh
humidity or something
um-hum
uh-huh
it kind of [noise] kind of down played compared to what you'd like huh do you find yourself um
with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain
um-hum
oh no
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
oh that sounds good
[laughter] well [noise] every once in a while i- i think i feel the same way when i'm entertaining i don't take that thing into consideration unless it's
really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes
oh yeah
um-hum yeah
yeah [laughter] yeah
oh that's good
uh-huh
um
nothing comes to mind right off so i guess not [laughter]
okay you too [vocalized-noise] bye-bye
[noise]
okay uh you want to start by telling me what camping is to you do you backpack or hike or
no i've never done a canoe trip that sounds interesting
i imagine
so they'll actually fit in the canoe and then you go for days at a time
God that sounds like fun [laughter]
well the camping i grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type and uh
you know that just either out in the woods or actually i i grew up water skiing i was uh from California and so we would go up to the Sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there
and you just pick a campground on the river if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water [laughter]
you know cooled off but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked and so we did that uh
i guess that we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago and that was a new experience to me but i enjoyed it i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a tent
but uh that that was interesting i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that
don't let that stop you [laughter]
i know
yeah so you haven't done that before
my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh Costa Rica
and they took about two weeks and went into i don't even know the name of the river there but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience she said it was truly incredible
and you know i there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it [laughter]
so
well do you have anything planned for this summer
oh okay
oh
i imagine
oh that doesn't that sounds good
that sounds
we've been wanting to start camping again this year too uh my oldest
child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half and then i have a little one that just turned two and we are in the process of potty training i didn't want to go camping with diapers
you know [laughter]
i and and you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent they'd be awake all night
so but i think with him almost potty trained and
you know she's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i'm i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh
with little back packs of their own and you know things like that
that's just
uh-huh
well that's true
ugh i would need that before i could teach them [laughter]
[noise]
well uh a little bit uh noth- nothing overly strenuous no the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that
oh it it's we've had a lot of fun uh i i moved to Dallas about five years ago
and we've made three different trips since i've been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty the
the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in Arkansas and the river was it was up about three feet so it was uh it was pre- it was pretty challenging
but uh and then we uh as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it
well yeah yeah it's the
that that particular one was a two day trip so what uh uh there's uh there's a outfitter and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river
yeah it it really is
okay
okay
right right
okay
boy i bet
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's that was uh that's always been our next step our our our little group of friends here we've we've been kind of getting married off and what not but uh that's
yeah that well it it it just puts a damper on things for a little while but we're we're starting to get everybody back together yeah we'd like to do a float trip down uh oh like Big Bend area or something like that
no no we haven't made that trip yet
i'll bet yeah
uh-huh yeah exactly
um not really just yet we've uh well i i do have uh a little bit of property i grew up in South Dakota
and i've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet there's uh there's a little lake up there
and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together and we basically own all the land around this little lake there it's divided up into ten lots
so we've got a private lake and it's completely undeveloped at this point so that's a possibility and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime it it's it's about two hours north of Minneapolis
so uh yeah in fact uh uh well i got married last summer and uh that's that's we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon we kind of took uh a tour of the United States for about a week
and uh up through that area but uh my wife's real excited about it so we're uh we're going to hope to get up there sometime early en- last year it was the end of July and it was a little too late for the fish but uh hopefully get up there
early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not
uh-huh
oh gosh yeah yeah
that's right
sure
right
you bet yeah we'll that you know [vocalized-noise] and there's a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too
you know it's like okay this this is [vocalized-noise] this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know and okay now we'll go look for one and that kind of thing that
[laughter] well [laughter] yeah that's ever- everybody might learn something that way but uh
but yeah that's there isn't there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh
a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that it's a lot of fun it really is
hello
[noise]
uh what kind of um
besides y- besides your salary what's what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit
oh
have you ever worked for a large organization
oh okay
okay
uh-huh
yeah
yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once
uh-huh
yeah that's true
that's true
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
no what is that
um no i hadn't heard of that
um
is that something that you should change from year to year
that sounds like it might be a really good idea
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well
[noise] i think of uh you mean as far as retirement
i think the the most important thing for me right now i- is really the medical coverage
uh
i am in uh
in uh involved in a four 401K but i'm uh contributing such a such a small amount right now
just to go ahead and have the account open because uh
uh
i just let's see i've been with this company for about three months and before that
uh we were
we're we're still in the process of trying to catch up
we were we were way behind financially and so haven't really uh quite managed to catch up yet
exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further
yeah
no
no that would complicate things even more [laughter]
yeah
yeah that's probably
uh-huh yeah that's true
well there's lets see what other
it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months
most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time
they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two
so it wor- it would work either way
probably five years i think
or seven
uh that's kind of far away
[laughter]
okay um
i've got another call coming in
okay all right bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
all right
yeah
well i guess uh
i i i'm kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed
uh
but yes i have worked i've worked for TI and i've worked for LTV
uh and i suppose that uh
so far as benefits are concerned the most important
to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits
at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh
in you know in my younger days i i was interested in what's the vacation policy
and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know
but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on
uh you know on
where you are in life as to what's most important
and uh
yeah
yeah uh you know if you're not uh if you haven't haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire
when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you
and uh
there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans
uh
i guess uh the companies that participate in the 401K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan
and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs uh
i i i'm a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line
and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees
so that they can pick and chose what they like uh
you know there they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not
and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where
the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an
and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company
fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits
but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them
so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them
and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one
uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically
uh as to you know as t- to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as
uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans
and uh i i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have
of course the 401- 401K is is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle
so uh
anyway uh
what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before
well as so far as benefit packages indi- in total
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i understand that yeah
yeah so
right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh
uh put your money all in the right in the s- you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it
you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh
yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because
you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child
and uh
[noise]
you want to have that coverage
so anyway uh
but what else
yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of typical vacation
programs uh vacation plans do do the companies have that you've worked for
uh so far as when you get vacation and how much
uh-huh
yeah it's i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so i'm not real sure how they're how they're changing what they're doing now
yeah
yeah
yeah but uh yeah that's a good deal
yeah how what do you what do you find that that they're uh when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or
yeah uh
yeah
[noise] so that's uh that's a that's a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh
in the past i've worked for companies you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good pl- uh vacation policy you know you got you got the two weeks [noise] the first year and then they went up
oh is that yours okay well and it's been nice talking to you
okay thanks
[noise]
yeah it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh
that uh
seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh
uh President Carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis [vocalized-noise] he always did it through rhetoric
and this time President Bush did it through action and he he drove policy
by
the course he took and almost forced public support or uh i mean he left almost no alternative
and and it was very interesting how he did it and uh i mean i'm i'm an Air Force officer so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know i'd certainly
uh i i mean i think it's great that all the support i have uh friends of mine from the Air F- i'm i'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory but other engi- guys here on base this is a B fifty two base where i work so
we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it
yes it was
yeah i'm i don't know the exact figure but i i would imagine that because of the
how close the the the vote was i'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be Just based on the sheer numbers of uh
the disparity of [noise] excuse me Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been
um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh
all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're
uh uh
they're in in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway
but
yeah yeah
right right i think that was all those
factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was
discussing whether we should uh wait longer but i i i know that
there's a
lot of reasons to wait longer but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability and we uh i think we over estimated it but still we were really
highly concerned about it and that we were worried that they were getting dug in and uh
yeah
right they couldn't yeah they couldn't yeah it's true they
Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh
that's right that's true
that's interesting i think uh
this political situation over there now is uh
uh it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will
uh uh today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before and uh
and uh this and the Israelis uh and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are uh
are cheering for Baker on his drive for
to reconcile relations with the Israelis so it's like [laughter]
yeah i [vocalized-noise]
no uh i i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago because i used to live in uh Massachusetts but uh
yeah New Hampshire
oh my gosh
uh
well
i don't
yeah i'd certainly uh support Israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy i think
i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that i think that is a a positive thing for them after um
uh thousands of years they have to uh
they had i think they in when they be- became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and uh
yeah
exactly exactly and uh
um so gee i lost my train of thought here but uh
um
so okay so i can't say whether that that i'm pro Israel or anti Israel i mean i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability
in the region and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh
uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing
right
[noise]
yeah somebody's going to and i think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they
whenever
one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something
they're going to try to make some peace but uh
the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or
they split they end up being becoming divisive themselves
uh i
it's interesting i i'm i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh that's
yeah i know that that is almost i mean that's absolutely unprecedented that was an an incredible foreign policy
coup on the part of the President and the State Department and that i mean that's never happened before and
i don't know if it will ever happen again but
yeah
okay
uh i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time
all right bye bye [noise]
[noise]
[noise]
all right
uh
i i would like to talk about just briefly [noise] what happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context
i think it's uh refreshing to see
the uh the support
that the President got from the American people
right
right
um-hum
yes
that's right
[noise]
really
right
yeah
[noise]
that's great um i- if you remember the vote in the Congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close
and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it
it it was
that's right
yep
especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let's talk about this little while longer
i mean how many years are we going to wait and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time
no doubt
i think so too
well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time
well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor
hum
interesting
well Baker is is really
not very much pro Israel
and did you know John Sununu is uh half Arab
yeah
right in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire i believe okay
i believe he was the only one of fifty governors
that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back
and uh now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors Israel and that that concerns me greatly
well they didn't have much choice they could either fight or die
[noise]
it is a positive thing um
however uh every time an organization such as the PLO says well we'll see if we can work with Israel
then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them
and so you you basically have
uh mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and i'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution
exactly
it is
yeah i i commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks
yep
exactly exactly
no
may not well it's been fun i enj- enjoyed talking with you
you never know
bye bye
[noise]
uh just about any kind of music except acid rock i- i don't care for acid rock
but uh i grew up with country and western but uh just about any kind of music i even like classical music
yeah
yeah i grew up with [noise] Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs
[laughter]
but uh i did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with James Galway
oh
that was fabulous when
yeah when he played Danny Boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
yeah and uh it was tremendous
yeah
yeah
yeah uh-huh and it was uh mostly all Irish tunes they they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then
guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and a drum and they
they played all the Irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah [laughter]
i love uh i li- i especially like instrumentals
yeah i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen
yeah
[laughter] uh i'm i never played an instrument in my life i've always wanted to i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something
but uh
[laughter] but i i'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
hm
hm
but i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
well like i say the acid rock i just do not ca- and i don't care for rap music either
huh-uh n- no
[laughter] if i can't understand the words i don't wanna listen to it
yeah
yeah
yeah
right
but i and i love uh i look at the orchestra music too like the Boston Pops or or anything
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they're good
and uh we went and saw uh Le- Le- Les Miserables
oh the music in that was fantastic
yeah
yeah it it uh
i can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was out you know out at the State Fair Music Hall
and uh it was well worth the price yeah
yeah
just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one and
we went and saw uh i think it was uh Sugar Babies that was good that had good music in it
uh that was the one with uh Mickey Rooney and uh oh what's that real oh not real old uh well she is old too dancer um
i can't think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something
uh
real long legs and dark hair
[laughter]
i can't think of it [vocalized-noise]
yeah
but uh
yeah
oh yeah yeah
Blackwoods
yeah
Alabama
yeah [laughter]
but i
yeah either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior
i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
yes
yeah
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western son- or singer is uh probably Eddy Arnold
hm
but i got ab- i've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old
seventy eight RPM records of country and western songs
Smiley Burnette i don't know if you're old enough to remember him
he was uh played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of Gene Autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was Froggy
had had a real raspy voice
and uh some of those old ones of course Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and Ernest Tubbs and
Red Foley and
yeah i took them up here to Collectors Rector Records and was able to get a little money for them
but uh
my m- mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records
the guys would and the guy would give her the old records
so uh
that's where i learned about
yeah course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight RPM records
well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle
and uh they just won't play on a
modern day uh
phonograph
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] course they you know just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because y- y- you get that scratchy sound
yeah yeah
yeah they warped real easy
yeah
no
yeah
yeah
yeah
yes
but i- i guess you know the old country and western music you back then when i was a kid there wasn't that much TV so that's all you had to listen to was the radio
and uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opry
and
yeah
i- i seems like it was on a Friday Friday or S-
what are your m- music interests
[laughter] me too [laughter] oh
yeah i did too and then
[noise] yeah uh i'm pretty diversified too i- i don't i don't like acid rock either i've [noise] i grew up in a small town so uh the only [noise] we only had one radio station so it was country music but then uh when i
[noise] oh really you're older than i am [laughter] oh
we don't get channel two my our cable doesn't i wish we got that one [noise] it was it well we don't get channel two
[laughter]
oh really
now he he is a g- uh actually i did i played flute for almost ten years [noise] and and uh so i- i- i- i appreciate his too his his mus- he he he's from Ireland isn't he
was yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah i he he is really good yeah i've i've
i come from a musical background so uh um i've played fl- flute flute and piano so [noise] i- i- i have uh [vocalized-noise]
a big appreciation for music
[noise] up to a point i i'm getting now to the age where i don't like the new stuff that's coming an- much of the new stuff that's coming out [noise] husband says i'm getting old [laughter]
do you
th- yeah th- that's nice to do th- that is
i've got a i've got a t- i've got a two year old who's now getting [noise] i'm getting w- well versed in in kiddy music [laughter] [noise]
yeah
yeah [laughter] well i was one of the forced ones [laughter]
oh i could never do that [laughter] i was never that brave but um [noise] yeah
yeah oh yeah i've i've done i've done that at church too haven't done that in a long time [noise]
so let's see what
well what kind of music do you not like
oh oh go- that's not music [laughter] that is not i don't know what that is but that's not music
well it's it's it's not it's not music it's just it's just uh uh b- talking in a beat it is just it's not exciting at all it doesn't [noise] it doesn't give you relaxation you can't dance to it you can't do anything to it yeah
d-
yeah
have you ever been to the t- to the Dallas Symphony have you is it are they good
are they i- i have never i've never been
oh really
i've i've heard i've heard that that is a really
[noise] [vocalized-noise] i heard that was hard to get tickets to [noise]
probably cost
yeah [noise] yeah that was a real
was it i- i bet it was i bet i really bet it was [noise] is that the only uh musical do you go see m- m- a lot of musicals
yeah the
that that would be that would be nice [laughter]
was it i how how i can't i don't know what that's about
[laughter]
uh oh oh i think i know who you're ta- oh i know who you're talking talking about she's got black hair
yeah okay i know who your talking about i can't think of her name either yeah that wa- that was that was i remember that being uh here a few years ago [noise]
[noise] oh oh the last country music [noise] my my parents still uh really like country music and they they like um they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Stadler Brothers and
and uh well my my my my parents
yeah m- my husband likes uh country music real well and he he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah and uh yeah he really likes Shenandoah
yeah oh yeah Al- well yeah yeah Alabama i think th- i think they're a bit t- over exposed [laughter] i get kind of ti- get ti- tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio [laughter]
oh i- i- i- i've never cared for Hank Williams Junior
i [laughter] oh we we watch those award shows too we li- we enjoyed watching the country and the Grammies and stuff but i just i just don't care for him i just never have i don't [noise]
i- is it okay uh i- i- i think i i- know who that is uh-huh i think my parents have [noise] have uh some of his records
yeah um
wow
i've heard the name
huh
i've i've never seen a Gene Autry movie hm
no i never have [noise]
yeah
yeah those go back quite a ways
yeah
it's hard to f-
oh yeah
yeah
well that would that's neat
that would be gr- great if they weren't too worn out at the time
is there not you you'd well you'd think there would be [vocalized-noise]
well that's true
oh yeah
well that's a shame
[noise] because i- i we go to antique stores a lot and you see seventy eights
uh a lot at at the store a- a- at or in record stores you'd
think there'd be a market for i i'm sure you could find old players for them but that'd cost a fortune if you could find them that worked [laughter] oh [noise]
no
um-hum well those things were big and thick weren't they
now you could kill somebody with them [laughter] and the one you buy go out and buy one now and they're just so thin and flimsy and
they just they're not meant to last at all
no neither are tapes i- i- i buy we buy cassette tapes and machines will eat them y- d- so you're best bet any d- anymo- these days is a compact disk those things are practically indestructible [laughter] [noise]
oh no
radio yeah
that that's just what [laughter] just what you had b- plus i think it was better back then to the T- there's too much TV now
and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television [noise] kept your imagination [noise]
was it i- i- kept i- it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does
oh yeah
[noise] was that on the radio every week
wha- what day what day was that on do you ha- y- can you recall
Fri-
did they say anything
i guess we got ten minutes or something like that i don't know
so what do you think
[noise]
yeah [laughter]
um-hum
[noise] i agree but i think they're slow [laughter] in testing [vocalized-noise] you know i don't know
about yours but mines they so slow they tested some people twice three times and some people haven't been tested at all
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
i like that i know when i- i was in that like [vocalized-noise] in the service and we didn't have we used to have to go every other month or whenever
to uh just d- d- we called it the golden flow but [laughter] and they did random drug testing
just because
[noise]
you know Uncle Sam but i've always thought that they were slow [noise] as far as outside of the government you know
[noise]
because i've al- i'm i'm use to it
[noise]
it's no big deal
[noise]
i guess if you're not doing anything it's no big deal people call it invasion of privacy not to me it's not because first of all if you're not doing anything they're not invading anything
you know and if you're taking medication from a doctor that's no big deal either
because then they'll or you have a prescription
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
[noise]
yeah
well see they don't do a blood test to us
[noise]
they just do a urine test which i think they should do a a blood test because then that tells them that you know they testing for [noise] drugs but i think
it's like i tell and then you know they have all this smoking stuff why don't they just test for alcohol because that's between drugs and alcohol that's it
[noise]
that's the biggest killer there is i think they should do both of them
you know because then that that way they'll they'll get rid of they can help the alkies and then they can help the people that's on drugs
you know
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
oh
oh yeah
um-hum i that's all right
[noise]
and see some people always talk about the kind of job you do
[noise] but it would that wouldn't be fair if they tested just people with strenuous jobs
because you know you you got your your your pilots and your your air traffic controllers your nurses your doctors
yes i would want all those people checked but then you got your bus drivers your truck drivers are checked because my husband drives a truck they he has to pass a physical
you know but i think why don't they and and to me it's wrong to check just the people that you think are affecting the public
you know
why not just check everybody so
[noise]
um-hum
yep
[noise]
[noise]
well that's all right
because they check our bosses and everything and i think that's the way it should be if they going to check you know that way you can't stay well they didn't check my boss
you know yeah they checked him too [laughter] so everybody's getting checked it's not like it's just little peons it's everybody
and th- that's the way i think they should do it that way it is random you know it's random because some people is already gone two three times and some people ain't went at all
[noise]
and they just when your number comes up your number comes up [laughter]
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
well i think if you're doing something really bad [vocalized-noise] it's going to show up
[noise]
you know
[noise]
i don't think you can hide
[noise]
certain drugs [laughter]
[noise]
that's thirty days
[noise]
they said it was thirty days but
on one of my our our thing is they said that you'd have to the way the test is you'd have to really be smoking for it to show up and i don't think that's right
that's what he told
that's what they tell you but i think it is i think it'd show up no matter what if you doing it then it's going to show up
yeah
i think they should check everybody everywhere that's working because see they got this and that's just like even all the football players yeah i think they ought to check them because you get kids looking up to them and here they are strung out on drugs what good is that you know that's not good
[noise]
oh yeah because the the
yeah
because they get strung out too
[noise]
they're no different
[noise]
but i guess you know that's they contract they don't
[noise]
but yet
and then they're strung out on drugs secretly
you know they go off because they have a drug problem
huh-uh [laughter] that's not right
yeah
he they're not testing him because they only testing for drugs
and i think they should test for alcohol
because we have some alkies too boy you can smell it on they breath
you know it's bad when you can smell alcohol on somebody but there's nothing you can do because they not drunk
but you know they drink constantly [noise] to get that breath smell
you know
but i said no they they getting on the smokers and stuff but i think i because like i told one guy i says smokers don't kill people in a wreck from being smoking
you know drunk people kill people from being drunk
so why are you know why don't they just to me they ought to just do the blood test for alcohol
and i said they'll have more people then
[noise]
i mean you know i can understand like on a Monday
[noise]
yeah but so is cigarettes
[noise]
you know so why charge me more
so you know drugs is not i- is is not legal
[noise]
some of them are
and some people are addicted to prescription drugs
and so what's the difference
you know they still got a drug habit but they're legal [laughter]
they got a drug problem but it's legal you know it's like huh-uh huh-uh no they need they need some help too
[laughter]
because they check those and i know one girl she was on some kind of medication
[noise]
but see they didn't bother her because she had a prescription
[noise]
but i mean what if she was hooked on them you know
how they going to know just because she has a prescription
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
so you need to to me if they going do a
they need to keep checking like if somebody's got some drugs in they system
[noise]
and it's all prescription it's fine but what kind of drug is it
[noise]
you know and then how long are they supposed to take it
if th- people have prescriptions for Valium but they're not supposed to take Valium twenty four hours a days you know all the time that's for if they have a problem
and and then see that way you'll find out if they have a problem because if they keep taking it they have a problem
or they wouldn't keep taking them [laughter]
[noise]
and test them ag- and see if they have it again
um-hum because you know they don't give you a whole bunch of them pills
because they gave my husband some
when his mother passed but that was for like to calm him down
you know but see now they're gone
i think they gave him like four pills
no and then that was it
[laughter]
[noise]
but see now they they would be out of his system but if he was to be tested
no
oh okay
um i think they should do it
i- i do because um with all all the sports you know and everything they're doing there
and also because whenever you're dealing with drugs like if y- if you are on drugs then that affects the way you work and everything
yeah
oh really
well see um and i worked for a steel mill the past two summers
and i had to go through you know a physical and everything and before they even told you you were hired like they just called me in for an interview
and i went in for my interview and then right there he said okay go down to the company hospital and you'll go through a physical so you know i mean it was really good that way because they they tested everyone right away
and you didn't you didn't have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didn't have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
yeah well see you know i well
right
yeah because like what
yeah you know what too whenever they did that for me like you know we had to take they did it blood and urine
and um they they gave you a paper right there and they said if you were out drinking or if you went out for a good time last night go ahead and write down that you did have beer or you did have alcohol or if you are on medicine go ahead and write down what medicine you are on
okay but i you know so they allotted for you know things like that like you know people didn't know they were being tested well you might have had a drink last night you know and that would show up too
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and then uh it got you know it got backfired on a lot of kids too because a lot of kids
um like you know like somehow they missed the physical or something
you know and they wrote down that they uh weren't but then they went back and they checked them like maybe a week after they were working and if they had drugs in their body i mean they were fired on the spot there was no ifs ands or buts about it
uh-huh
yeah yeah i think this way too because in that steel mill i mean someone
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
y- yeah see they checked everyone in the mill too and then that was hard because you know someone would come in and they had a problem well then if i like some of the jobs i was doing was very dangerous you know
we were working with that steel that's thousands of degrees hot and i would have to cover for him you know like i would have to do two jobs for someone just because they they think they're being smart or something
you know and i mean they even had um the the higher up management people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks you know
so it was really good you know they were checking you know visually and
uh with the blood and the urine tests
yeah i thought it was really good
uh-huh yeah yes
right
uh-huh
yeah right and then uh they checked us like once during the middle of the summer also
you know like it's not like they just like well then the second time when i got hired i knew what was coming you know so then they checked us again in the middle of the summer
so i thought that was really good too
i don't i [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
[laughter] no i think it what is it like
i know even even like ster- well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body
[vocalized-noise] see so there still
oh really i thought it would show up with no matter what amount we
yeah
and and steroids i mean that kind of drug that's a lot longer
that takes a lot longer to get out of your body
[noise] that's right yeah
and e- and even uh
i don't know sometimes i think they should even check the the music you know the entertainment
with with uh the movie stars and and the singers and everything
yeah
um-hum
and they're out winning awards you know and then and then the younger kids think they're great and everything
exactly
uh-huh
yeah you know what i think's i bunch of bull too is whenever um they um really you know like nationwide or you know popular people
they do have a problem and they come out and they say they're having the problem so then they get more publicity because they admitted they have a problem and they're trying to fix it
well what about the Joe Shmoe who's an alcoholic and he's trying to fix it you know but he's not getting any
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
right
uh-huh
[laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
that's right
that's true
i never thought of it that way but that's true
um-hum
yeah
oh definitely
yeah but then you can look at it there too well alcohol's legal
yeah
uh-huh
yeah um-hum
exactly yeah
um-hum
that's true [laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
yeah
that's true
how are you going to tell if she's hooked on them you'd have to take her off them you know some people
i mean that's th- they they go off them and they they're going to die
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
[noise]
yeah
uh-huh
and then also after you know they can find out whenever their prescription ends and then find out you know how long it will take for that to be out of their system and then test them again
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
okay uh what do you think about the the idea of having volunteer service for everyone
[vocalized-noise]
well
well are you doing any kind of volunteer work now
[noise] what about when when would people do it when they finished high school
i think particular boys [noise] the the maturity in fact i wasn't very mature when i left high school and i
i think there's a there's a real challenge there there's also this this issue of of uh
you know whether you're really relly and i think it gives a different perspective
the only complication is is is how do you fund something like this
yeah i think the Mormon church has sends out missionaries that
that's uh it's interesting it gets them away from home and and gets them do something useful although the kids today though it it seems that almost that their concern for money i we were doing some
investigating colleges and said the kids are much more interested today in in trying to find a job
to study something that'll give them a job as opposed to it'd be curious be curious if there wa- if there was mandatory do you consider the option of eith- the mandatory military service or volunteer do you think that would be reasonable
[noise] well but the the issue of of of would y- what what would what would you find it what would you have them do you know there're a lot of people around with there's a lot of unemployment right now what would you have these people do if they were brought in
well yeah or say say the volunteer say that say that it was mandatory
yes my father was in the CCC camp
[noise] well it seems that there's some things like the um [noise] the programs at least just go around and and and clean up streets and and and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things
[noise] yeah in fact we we helped with um oh Habitat for Humanities and that was a that was a good experience but you take the kids out and [noise]
and there are a lot of the buildings in downtown areas that that either need demolishing or need fixing up so it would be a good idea [noise] um we've been doing this three or four minutes i think that uh
do you have any other further comments
well it was good talking to you Betty have a good night
[noise]
uh i think that uh really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service
uh and you know i mean
there have been so many people that have done it and i've talked with several and i think they've gotten a lot out of it
[noise] not right now but i have done uh Red Clo- Cross work and uh i've taught CPR training
a-
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal because a lot of times
[noise] if they go straight into college
i think they're going in too quick
but
right uh you know i- i think if you've been out of school a year year and a half before you start to college you appreciate college more than someone that just goes right straight into college
well a lot of parents fund their children there are uh some groups that have their children you know go away for a year even the religious organizations
right and the parents fund them for the whole year year and a half that they're gone
i think it would i- in Israel the even the women are are required to to be in the military for a certain period of time uh i was in the military
and i personally feel if th- if they have dra- the draft that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men
what into the service or
well i-
i- i think that they ought to have something for the the unemployed
in a voluntary field like the i do- i don't know if you know remember about the WPA
he was in that i mean you know uh it's not the best thing in the world but uh it gave them something to do
r- or go into the the more depressed areas and help repair the houses
um-hum
no not really
[noise] okay i'll talk to you later bye [noise]
[noise]
okay
[laughter] where to start
um-hum
um-hum
that's true
i didn't think about that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i agree [laughter]
yes i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name [laughter]
and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires it's funny because i'm i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call but um
i haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i- i just have a real hard time doing that
um and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and TV's and VCR's and
and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make and you wonder
well who's going to get ahold of this and think um that's a nice place to go rob [laughter]
right
um-hum
um-hum
i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner
carpet cleaning [laughter]
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh no
[laughter]
right
yeah
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and
you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you s- right when you sit down to dinner because they know
they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and
and i've gotten a lot of them lately or i'll sometimes i come home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and
i wasn't home and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on but
i find that very annoying the uh mail stuff yeah you know it's kind of irritating but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
uh oh [laughter]
[laughter]
right
um-hum i agree with the phone too in that i'm single but
when i come home from work there's times i need to pay bills i need to balance my checking account i need to do all kinds of different things like that and
even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time i need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me but that's
that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message and i can call them back but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in sometimes it is just
i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me and uh if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally we have uh like this past week we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system
and uh phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone and if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse
and uh it just i get to where i- i turn the answering machine on
and just let it pick up the phone but now with this thing i'm participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's uh you know somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
a ring at all
oh huh that's an idea [laughter]
[laughter]
right
um-hum
yeah ours is that way too
um-hum
well yours is probably the same as ours it's uh Tigon isn't Tigon uh part of GTE or vice versa or something like that
seems i read
okay okay that's it that GTE had purchased Tigon and yeah that's what we have
Aspen hum
i couldn't remember in Tigon had purchased GTE's phone mail services or if GTE had purchased Tigon i knew there was some type of a tie in there i remember reading in the paper a few months back but
okay
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh no
i think we did that's good [laughter]
i didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing but uh
i guess it's close enough [laughter]
sure good talking to you Jim
all right bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter]
well i think
uh i haven't had that much of course i just heard but i haven't had that much time to think about it either
i guess the
um
biggest thing i f-
f- find is the
financial
aspects uh particularly
the ability of people to access
you know your financial records or for example your credit r- uh rating
almost at will
and uh
of course
flying uh using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that
and almost anything you do now
uh a Social Security number is required
and uh
of course there's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy i just thought about it being a professional and of course you probably belong to
one or more professional organizations and that is that
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists
which i think is a is an invasion of privacy
[laughter]
um-hum
and not only that it it opens you to
phone solicitations
and i
i've noticed more and more i would say over the last
six months
i am getting more
at home phone solicitations
for a variety of things from
i've had them for carpet cleaning i've had them for of course for you know real estate investments know you get uh
please send in your uh you know this particular card and you get uh
a free trip or something along those lines
and so that uh that bothers me because i
of course i enjoy being at home and
i do not enjoy
getting called by strangers
uh particularly solicit you know soliciting
so
having your and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers
but some of them are sold and i know you talking about mailing lists
the i there is one particular
group to which i belong and for some the reason they have three
different
names
for me now the address is the same you know my my office address
but they have one under you know my first name James
they have one under my first name and initial middle initial then they have a a third one under my just my two initials
and
i get mail
here at home
under each of those names
so i know that they have sold their mailing list
and uh
i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy
and uh
i can't really think of anything else offhand that uh
um-hum
i think you i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner
i know when i sit down with the family
and want to have the opportunity you know to talk
and see what's going on and all those things
even if friends call
it irritates me so i try to i actually during that period of time
from you know usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will
shut off the phone
and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager
so she'll you know why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call so
so tho- i guess those three things are the uh
um
most irritating to me
that's right
well i have you know we have a you know voice mail system at uh at the office
now what i have done is
i have forwarded my home phone
to the answering service at the office
so that i do not have to have a um a ring at all
if i if i want to do that
and uh or i will just
let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office
and so it's you know it makes it convenient but at the office when i you know we can uh on our system and i imagine on most systems
you can just
route it directly to the
answering service
and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that's exactly what i do
and so uh
uh
yeah well Tigon is part of GTE
[laughter]
um-hum
except we call it Aspen but
yes
and uh
[laughter] we
yeah GTE purchased Tigon
and so
we
have have been using a the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon
so i imagine we will be
uh shifting over to that service
uh for a while or if in a while
as soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought Contel [laughter]
yeah
oh Dana i think we have probably conversed long enough well all right
[laughter]
all right well thank you for calling i ha- i- i enjoyed talking to you
take care
[noise]
[noise]
okay so have you seen any good movies lately
oh i haven't seen that one yet
uh no i haven't seen that one yet either
how about uh Awakenings
okay well have you seen LA Story
uh yeah i have
uh well it was it was entertaining it was funny Steve Martin did a pretty good job
uh it's uh they portray the LA lifestyle
and it's uh quite a lot uh crazier in the movie than it is in actuality i've been to Los Angeles before
and nothing's as crazy as what they how they uh uh describe it in the movie [laughter]
it's kind of fun if you've been there before y- you'll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie
okay
i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with uh Victoria Tennant as his uh love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality
so that added something to the movie
no i haven't seen that one yet either
okay
yeah i i heard that uh it was a little pretentious that the family was very wealthy a-
it just didn't uh appeal to uh to as many people as it as it could have
yeah i've heard that's really really good uh friend of mine at work saw that
well i understand it has a real complicated plot
uh-huh
okay yeah um
you seen uh Ghost
yeah it's been out for quite a while already
that is a is it is a very good movie
uh Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore did a really good job very uh uh emotional put it that way uh
well that's interesting the special effects were great i have to admit that
okay
you seen uh Edward Scissorhands
oh i-
it's
uh yeah it's somewhat of a a bittersweet comedy
it stars uh Johnny Depp
he's uh from 21 Jump Street
and uh he portrays uh Edward Scissorhands this uh creation of uh Vincent Price uh kind of a uh scientist
who uh creates a person uh out of uh
oh just uh spare parts and i guess uh cookie cutters or whatever [laughter]
it it's kind of interesting he he doesn't complete the job though and his hands are are are not finished so he has scissors on the ends of his arms
and uh is is found in this uh castle by uh
oh it's the local Avon lady or something like that
and she takes him into her house and uh he learns
what life is like uh in a uh moderately normal suburb
it's uh it it is entertaining it's kind of like a fairy tale
with a sad ending but uh
it's uh
uh it was different
a fun movie
oh yes certainly um-hum
oh i think it'd be great for a for a a child
it does have a a a fairy tale like uh quality
that
scenery is is very entertaining uh and what he does with the with the scissors and uh
uh doing uh certain types of landscaping uh working with shrubberies
uh he uh carves out different figures in the in the p- plants shrubs
uh yeah i they s- they evidently spent a lot of time on uh on the scenery for that the special effects
have you seen The Field over at the Inwood
that's i thought that was an outstanding film
with
with Richard Harris
uh he plays a uh kind of a patriarch in uh Ireland nineteen twenties Ireland
and uh it's about a uh piece of land that he rents
uh he works uh a piece of land and rents it from uh an old English uh widow
but uh he
he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and won't allow anyone else to uh to uh control that land
and when the widow puts it up for uh for sale uh
he claims that it's his even though he cannot afford uh the p- the price
it uh goes to an Am- American uh who has uh ancestors from from the area
he's trying to uh
apparently trying to uh uh
gain some background on his his heritage from uh Ireland so he's buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area
and uh there are just a lot of uh interesting
[noise]
well they well they have more of of the artsy type of uh films a lot of foreign films there
no not too often uh but uh this was a uh just a good opportunity to go see that movie it was uh
i really enjoyed it
well they cut you off after ten [laughter]
yeah
oh okay
well getting back to uh to that other uh film uh with uh which one was that with Jodie Foster
uh Silence of the Lambs yeah i didn't really care for her her earlier films uh Taxi Driver or The Accused and i was kind of wondering if this was uh a little different style
departure from what she's done before
okay
see i never did care for her too much in the other films so
friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different that uh she's really good
all right that's interesting because i
okay
well that's good i'll have to go see that
it's been highly recommended
Anthony Hopkins
uh-huh
sounds like i'll have to go see that one soon
okay yeah Sleeping with the Enemy with Julia Roberts i haven't seen Pretty Woman yet uh have you seen that one
because she was just on uh the People's Choice Awards the other night
and won uh a People's Choice Award for uh best uh female entertainer
as well as uh an award for this movie
okay well i'll have to go see that one too
sounds like another obsession type movie uh like Fatal Attraction
uh i thought that uh the movie the movie that it was based on was better
that was uh which one was that
with uh Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills
it came out in nineteen seventy trying
oh it was called Play Misty for Me
and i thought that was a very good film and Fatal Attraction was on the same theme almost identical
but uh i didn't care for Fatal Attraction as much
no it gets quite violent [laughter]
yeah
right
well
[laughter]
okay well i think we're reaching our limit anyways so
all right i appreciate it thanks a lot bye
[noise]
uh well let's see i think the best one i saw was probably Sleeping with the Enemy
have you seen Silence of the Lambs
oh well tell
no but i've heard it's really good
no i haven't seen that did you
what did you think of it
huh
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
[laughter]
yeah well i saw a few of the uh little coming attractions you know it looked really cute but
yeah well i've never been to California i've lived in Washington but not California so
oh i didn't even realize that that's interesting hum
yeah i guess so did you see Home Alone
oh well i was kind of disappointed in that one
i've heard so much about it that you know it's such a great movie and you ought to go see it over and over again and
uh i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble
uh-huh
yeah yeah i was kind of disappointed
but um [vocalized-noise] are you intending to see Silence of the Lambs have you
yeah it's pretty intriguing
yeah it's it's a very unusual movie
kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasn't as
scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way
yeah yeah it really does
the only way they can get any information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre it's hard to tell what he's going to do next so yeah s- it was a good movie
and then i thought Sleeping with the Enemy was even scarier but that's because it was about a man chasing a woman and that's my big fear so
[noise]
i was trying to think if i've seen any others lately but
that probably pretty much sums up i don't get to go to the movie too much
no i haven't as a matter of fact it's on at the dollar movie around here and i was wanting to go
yeah i heard it was really good
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah
yeah that's the way i under- as a matter of fact my sister believes in uh ghosts and she said that she thinks that's a real uh true portrayal of what it would be like
yeah
yeah i i want to see that as a matter of fact i intended to go one night and didn't get to so
hopefully we'll go soon
no i haven't
as a matter of fact i don't know anything about that movie what it i- is that [vocalized-noise] funny or
huh
uh-huh
right
hum
oh really huh
yeah
oh
oh huh
uh-huh
oh well that is interesting
yeah huh
yeah oh
yeah well that sounds pretty yeah [noise] is it something uh that you could take a child to
oh i have a six and a half year old that'd probably enjoy that
yeah huh
[noise] oh
oh well i'll have to
have to take her to see that
um-hum
hum
oh really huh
wow that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make
yeah i can imagine
no i haven't
huh i don't know anything about that either
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
hum
hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
[noise]
i have never been to the Inwood theatre
um-hum
yeah do you go there often
yeah hum
yeah well it sounds interesting
well does this um
however this is set up tell you when you've talked for five minutes or
do you oh really oh that's interesting
oh okay well i didn't know this is the first call that i've made so i wasn't real sure if you
if it tells you when you've talked long enough or [laughter]
let me think if i have seen anything else that's interesting lately
uh-huh yeah Silence of the Lambs um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh i'm sure
i haven't seen either one of the other films she was in but uh my husband said that
he thought she was playing a real different role i- in this show yeah
yeah
yeah
i i one of the things that i was really impressed with uh she has to
have an accent that she does a real good job with i it sounds so real that she sounds like she's from that area of the country
yeah uh i think it's like in the i don't know Alabama Georgia South Carolina area or something it's
and she does a real good job sounding like she's from that area [noise]
but um i thought she did a really good job
yeah
the man that plays this bizarre character is really i don't know if i've ever seen him in a film before i don't e-
oh with Anthony Perkins yeah
i didn't remember him from anything else i i'm sure i've seen him in other movies but he looked so his his face the entire movie just haunts you
and uh he did a real good job
yeah
yeah there was a big crowd there i think it's uh definitely getting some good ratings
um-hum
no i haven't
oh really
hum
oh i didn't realize that
well i thought it was i really enjoyed that movie i mean it scared me more than the other one but it was real intense to me i enjoyed it
yeah yeah it was it has a real eerie beginning
and the man that she's married to is obviously crazy but at the first you don't really
know about that and it's real interesting the way it starts out
so uh i thought it was really int-
yeah
yeah it is it's a lot like that
i thought Fatal Attraction was a good movie did you like it
i didn't like the ending but
oh really
hum
i didn't know it was based on another film
um
um-hum
oh i see
huh
huh well i liked it until toward the end i
i didn't care for it too much but
yeah yeah and it's kind of unbelievable too
the this woman can live through everything she lived through
yeah
well
i can't think of much else to talk about [laughter]
yeah i think so well thanks for calling
uh-huh good-bye
[noise]
[noise]
you want to start [laughter]
yeah
i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically
demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men
um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother
go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me that's kind of a drawback
but uh i guess it's a price you pay
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up
in the uh
uh day care centers
[noise]
well uh from what i understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious
uh they term it as more uh
creative
but uh that they uh are much more contentious
so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation
to see what differences
a child being brought up you know in in a kind of a uh community
rather than a home
yeah
uh-huh
so they
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
what do you mean
uh
oh yeah
yeah
that's strange
a nanny sort of
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
right
um-hum um-hum
to come in and live with them to come in and live with them
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than
in like a classroom or a day care center
i know the day care centers are not cheap either
you know they're
uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the a single
uh wh- i mean a babysitter more more or less
but i think it's like about sixty dollars a week
for two children if i'm not mistaken
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick
i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay
and uh
uh
i think [noise]
i really don't have a vision
[laughter]
yeah
i um
i think that they will be more in the work place because
uh the door's open
and uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door
so and i would be glad to see that
i hope i don't see a lot more single moms
but
i- it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's awful
yeah
uh-huh
right
well i think we've done it [laughter] thank you very much it's been interesting
okay bye
[noise]
well i guess i would
first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that
um
i [vocalized-noise] am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in
both in society and in the work place uh
there's no doubt about the fact that when i f- was first graduated from college the impression was that
a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily
uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where
couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to sh- both share homemaking duties and also how women will
uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
and i guess that's a significant change that of i've both participated in an- and noticed
uh-huh
wonder about them in what way
uh-huh
uh-huh
i have not to be honest had much experience
with children in that situation i i guess one knows one's own storly and i know
uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until
the older of two was in
uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force
um
[noise]
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together
um
and we never actually experienced that
what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next
generation or so i guess i anticipate um
an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles
um
i don't know whether
there will be
an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don't know
um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother
sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh
uh whether one might conceive [vocalized-noise] no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um
a professional mother a person
for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh
uh story or whatever i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises
nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession
uh um
i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on
the var- on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not
uh i know that that my sense is that i have
very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don't know that i
uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs
uh i don't have boys that doesn't didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or
or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh
maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care
it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting
um i know that there are young people
characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they're young uh
that in my work place who are both of them earning rather
decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying
a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon
or to put their child into a s- into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and
and you were paying for really high quality care
uh i have
acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years
um-hum um-hum
i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
what
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society
that's okay too
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming [vocalized-noise] emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of
the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome
uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable
uh and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe uh p- the possibility of of women
uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever
so
well i think we're about done okay uh good bye
you take care bye
[noise]
[noise]
[noise] so huh what do you think should they uh should young Americans be forced to do a year of service
yeah i think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh
[laughter]
[noise] know kids [noise] [noise]
[noise] [noise]
move on
yeah i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two a- and and force them i think that uh i think it'd be i think mo- i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it
right exactly i was a i was a Boy Scout and as part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a do a year long project for
yeah i think i i now i think people generally volunteer that that there's no problem with getting them to to do stuff
well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world's problems or something
so [laughter] i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh or just or just gave or or j- or just forced our kids just to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess
substitute my my yeah my kid'll do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem
oh i
i've seen that yeah
they they just started trying to get them together l- l- like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh ver- very recently you don't sound like you're in the north you sound like you're in the south somewhere
yeah uh i'm in uh New York u- u- upstate New York yeah and uh [laughter] long way uh
and we just had a really big ice storm and basically half the trees in in in our city i'm in Rochester which is uh right upstate half of the trees in the city
um are no good anymore and that's how bad it was everything is just down everywhere you know we had three hundred thousand people without power
you know it was and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power it's i- oh yeah it's been over it's been ten days already and there are still something like
ten thousand people without power and were officially yeah and we're officially in a state of emergency funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it um
yeah i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days you know we just got our phone back today uh
and and they're you know putting out ads and now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets
because we have you know every- everywhere that a tree is down people need help and we're all all a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone and they and and they certainly can't carry it themselves and so
oh that's great
and is that supported by all donation to the church and so forth or
oh so he
that's real nice
[noise]
[laughter]
right
that that that's real good and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that
yeah
that's that's uh that's real good we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did um
some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that and i'm convinced that that that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of uh
some sort of group you know ac- activity like that you know twenty fi- i don't know twenty five percent yeah my wife was big in that [laughter] and she thinks yeah twenty five percent it's it was a small school [laughter] but um
yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do there was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group
such that you know lots of people got involved that way
yeah
[laughter] yeah no neither do i i think it should be completely optional and you know
yeah they're not worth a year or some people unfort- just just can't even afford it you know or whatever i mean the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well
you know people get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents i have a um a a friend whose whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now
and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala
you know so so i think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money
so i can see where that that may be a problem
[laughter]
just take off a year
right
yeah i don't yeah well neither can i so i i i i i i did my service before and i'll do my little community service throughout but [vocalized-noise] never never for a year again
but so right so i guess our vote is no [laughter]
[laughter] well it's been nice talking to you i guess
well yeah we're we're slowly getting everything back together again you know it it's taking time but everything you know we got lucky we had no damage to our house or anything so the rest'll just have to come with time
well good luck to you too [laughter] bye-bye
[noise]
i don't i don't think they should be forced but i think they should be en- i guess encouraged to
to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity if nothing else see how the city works stuff like that
yeah i [laughter] i think so too i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it it's a good idea to get them involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and
uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can
yeah
you're right i do too i think they start out young like in uh Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts doing s-
ex-
right that's see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing something
yeah
[noise] i do too i think i think a lot of peop- a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that
and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and [noise] you know per- helping a- helping out i think that's good and
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah yeah
[laughter] i'll be
yeah [laughter] there you go tha-
hey
yeah it sounds pretty good [laughter] that sounds good i've noticed a lot of uh [noise] different organizations in our community uh
pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up
and keep it clean i think that's a pretty good idea and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to
to learn how to volunteer as they get older i know i did you know in li- Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that [noise] so
oh
y- i'm in Texas where are you at
New York
oh gosh
yeah yeah [laughter]
um-hum
oh no
oh
golly
[laughter] are you seri-
oh
oh my God how do they live
yeah i haven't heard a thing
oh
Lord
God
well that's good that's great
right
yeah
yeah
right
right [noise] that's one thing we do at our church is um [noise] we have a group called Hearts and Hammers and we go along and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people
that cannot afford to fix up their homes that n- desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can
yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps
uh yeah they uh [noise] luckily we have a a man who owns a building company
so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy
[noise] yeah and it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out so it's real neat it's
yeah it's like i say it's not a lot but it helps people like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and i just you know it just tears your heart out to
to see this kind of thing and you know if you can do a- any little bit it helps so
yeah
yeah
go- that's great that's a lot
that's that's a lot of kids though
oh well still that's a l- you know that's a good chunk of kid-
yeah
yeah that's neat
that's great that's great but uh like i'll agree with you though i don't think they should have to do a year [laughter]
yeah i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean they're not worth it
right
oh yeah that's true that's true
oh oh oh
i i couldn't either i couldn't either
right right
yeah i just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and [noise] i me- she's a teacher and and just wanted to do it she'd been a teacher for a while just decided she wanted to do it so
i mean i'm grateful for people like that but i don't see how they can just
yeah just pick up and head on out i wish i could do something like that but
i can't so [laughter]
right that's the way i am [laughter] i know the feeling
that's right [laughter] we're against it [laughter]
that's right
you too and i hope everything works out up there
yeah
good good that's great
yeah well good luck
thanks bye
[noise]
okay so what do you think
uh-huh
yeah
[noise]
the person gets killed you know
yeah something like that but my problem with capital mur- capital punishment is they don't carry it out
so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it
you know they people people been sitting like they had on 20/20 or 48 Hours one of them they had them on the man was twenty years waiting on death row
see that don't make no sense
yeah
and now i think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers
[noise]
huh-uh
they're not going to do it
[noise] that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know
[noise]
huh
what do you mean what have been
that's the whole system though isn't it
there are a lot of people that aren't guilty that's in jail
but you know
uh i- i i don't know about if y- if they was
like capital murder
and then if they were married then what would you do
yeah
uh-huh
i don't know if i could i could prob- it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people that's killing kids
uh the ones messing with old people
those type of people now i i have no pity for them
you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldn't die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say
[noise]
i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway
i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it [laughter]
so i don't know
yes
die because it all depends
there's a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don't have uh
self-defense laws and i think that's wrong
yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was sev- i'll never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat
well she shot him and she went to prison
she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that's not right
they she's nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldn't have hit her in the stomach i don't care
[laughter]
but he did both
well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time
oh yeah
sh- no she lost the baby
he hit her in the stomach with the shovel
it's just you know things like that that you know i don't think those women or even a man because a man they had a wo- man that his wife shot him but he didn't die
and uh they put her in jail now i don't think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property
see i think that's wrong too
but i don't
no she she wouldn't have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i don't know actually what they give the death penalty for
the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know
uh-huh
i don't know
no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that's worse for them too
they're not they don't know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore [noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
i don't know
they don't they don't put it on the news or they don't broadcast it because you know the i guess they don't just don't
uh-huh
oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something
yeah
yeah
but i think they going to have to do something
to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers
you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i don't think they ought to get in trouble
i mean i know they ought to get in trouble i'm not [vocalized-noise] they ought to get in trouble but not not death because see they you know we're to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man
because see that's where it's coming from to me it it's coming in here some kind of way i don't care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it's all government something to do with the government i really do
because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you can't buy anything Cuban
in the United States so why can't they stop anything illegal
you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just don't want to put there's too much money people's been bought out you know and that's what's wrong with some of the kids on the street
[noise]
they you can't blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day
for just taking a bag somewhere
[noise]
and his mom is not getting that much money
you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto
my mom would probably kill us but [laughter]
but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere
[noise]
uh-huh innocent people not just the drug people i'm talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because i'm from Los Angeles
see originally i've been in Texas twelve thirteen years
but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them
so
but i don't know too much about the death penalty
yeah but they don't use that no more
they use the the injection thing or whatever it is
[noise]
uh-huh
it's funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they don't have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because
i'll pull the switch
i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else
you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him
now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don't know
i guess if you stay out of trouble you don't have you worry about it but
[laughter]
uh-huh
so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and
how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble
you know so
but that's all i got to say
and it is nice talking to you all righty
oh it's fun i ca-
well i believe in capital punishment um and i i think
the way that i understand the laws right now they are only for certain crimes um i'm not sure exactly what they are i think rape and uh
capital murder
[noise]
oh yeah that would be a capital crime yeah
yeah i agree they
i agree they uh
uh-huh
yeah i think that we waste a lot of money keeping people in prison
that uh is not necessary
yeah have you ever been on a jury
i haven't either but and i you know i i have real strong beliefs in capital punishment but when it comes right down to it
yeah i i'm wondering though
right
but what if they're not guilty
what if they're not guilty
what if they truly are not guilty and they're convicted anyway
yeah see that's what
yeah
yeah
i don't know you know like i sai- said i do believe in capital punishment but if i were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision [laughter] i wouldn't want to have to be the one to make it
and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if they're going to do well you know let's do it
do it and get it over with
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah but i don't know if they if [noise] they if uh the death penalty
ye- yeah i don't think they give it to just
yeah [laughter] for a long time
uh
i definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail i don't think everybody that kills somebody should die
so under the circumstances
is it i i'm from i've lived in Ohio and i didn't realize that
um
oh my gosh
um
huh-uh
well see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat anyway
yeah well i wonder wh- did they say why
oh
so there was a history of that
so she's not going to get to have her baby
oh okay
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
cheaper than a divorce
yeah
um
yeah i think capital cri- uh capital crimes and i want to say kidnap i don't know why kidnapping sticks in my mind but um
yeah i think they should give it to them but i don't think they should keep them waiting in jail and let having us pay for it for twenty years
yeah
well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas
i think Texas is very uh one of the leading states i mean i think Texas executes more people than just about any other state
well they they th- they don't sensationalize it anymore they used to make a big deal out of it every time it happened
and i think now that it happens more frequently than we know that it's just not sensationalized as much at least in Texas because i hear every once in a while i'll hear something on the news
i
but they ought to get yeah i was [laughter]
they
yeah
hum
yeah
uh-huh
hum
[laughter]
yeah
well yeah i mean whe- when you think about it
yeah when you think about how many people die from drugs you know ultimately
oh yeah
um
yeah
um
yeah
i agree
i think that that they have much i like that they've changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or gas
no they don't
yeah i think that's a lot more humane than uh than the electric chair than the than the gas or the gas
kill [noise] right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well it's like you said though sometimes people just get caught up in it innocently but
ye-
yeah [noise]
yeah
[noise]
okay
well it's nice talking to you i'll have to start doing this again some more [laughter] i i don't know what i've tried it several times with
[noise]
okay
well i i think it's a pretty good deal i think they should either do that o- or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people i
i i'd you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and
and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and
i'm not sure that that's not a bad idear and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about yourself
yeah i've i that's really great i i really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that an- and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but
ah senior okay so there's not uh
yeah they they lose interest and then when they young young adults there's even less interest they're they're more for
i gue- uh not not yeah i mean me yeah [laughter] you're absolutely right [laughter] i think it's a really a good thing i i like to see
of course there's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help [laughter]
[noise] but i think we ought to start right here at home i'm [noise] you know
no i- it
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook
well it's been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully we'll have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i gue-
[vocalized-noise] we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you ma'am bye-bye
[noise]
okay what do you think about the idea of uh
kids having to do public service work for a year do you think it's a
yes yes def-
that's true
yeah
uh i agree with you um um what i'm thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of
[vocalized-noise] you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts and they di- do do do a lot of public service
activities but these days they're not um p- parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that because when i was in the Girl Scouts we did a lot of public service things
because that's just part o- of of the scouting and you know [noise]
they are but parents
yeah they do
oh no
i- i a senior
oh they're just not um once they get into junior high they just not done anymore [noise]
um-hum
me [laughter] grab grab grab walk [laughter]
yeah
yeah but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country too
yeah um i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for s- for uh a lot of young ki- people
but uh since there is much that needs to be done here
um-hum
no uh i agree with you [laughter]
yeah
okay you too
you too [laughter] bye-bye
[noise]
yeah how many children do you have
and i have three what do you have boys girls
i have
uh-huh i have two girls and one boy
do you have grandchildren yet
oh i got ahead of you there i got three and one on the way [laughter]
no but uh i know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of time together
uh school activities and my my boy was in hockey
and of course the girls uh and and uh myself we rooted you know we didn't participate but we did a lot of family things together
we had animals for the children you know our horses and that kind of thing and uh school activities type stuff
uh-huh
uh-huh
did you find the time to attend
oh yeah we did too
i think that's kind of the key don't you
i think that's kind of the key
is to not be in the big city
right
and
yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country
i mean it's not as vast a country as like you know where you people are from because i lived in Abilene for a little while
and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there
you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
but they at least they had the background
and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they don't [noise] get into as much trouble or seek to
you know do other things that are really not good for them you know
yep same here
no
no i know i'm so happy that i had mine had mine when i did and that i'm not having them now i think about it
no no
and plus i think that the uh mo- the husbands and wives both having to work
it's not a matter of choice anymore i think most people
yeah
and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids
of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day
you know and then uh my uh husband was with them at night
so they were always with a family member you know
and babysitters and uh day care and all that stuff kids don't really bond anymore
the mother's aren't there
oh yeah
yep
exactly
but you know uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center and everything else is it really worth all that
rather than to wait until the children are like in school
and then go for that type of goal i think that too many people want everything now
like we had to save and plan and
do without and that kind of stuff where it's now the credit cards and
i mean they just go and buy it you know
exac-
yep
exactly
sure
that's my point and and i think that they should like learn how to crawl before they walk
it's it's too much it and it's too accessible
and they get into it and they're over their heads i think that's why there's so many divorces too
because the money becomes uh an issue the children become an issue the jobs become an issue and it's like you know what's left
just to argue and that type of thing you know
i do i do
they're like between a rock and a hard spot
it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer
or mothers to children you know because they're able to spend some time
at
yeah
no huh
yeah i think that's great because i mean you know you you it's less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or
just know they're close by
you know it's it's very hard
well it was nice chatting with you
yes i do i do
no i do
yeah
i work in uh building twelve in Attleboro
uh
oh you should come it's it's a it's a nice place in the summertime though don't come in the winter [laughter]
right now we're in the thirties
and we're expecting a snowstorm tomorrow into Friday
possibly Saturday
so it's supposed to be real bad driving tomorrow afternoon
[laughter]
oh that's terrible
[laughter] i'm jealous
no i it it's well this is the month where it's very unsettled because March is like between winter and spring out here it's like one minute you've got winter weather the next minute you have spring like weather everybody's got a cold
you don't know how to dress you know
so it's kind of tough
and they say that the driving tomorrow is supposed to be really bad in the afternoon
have they
yeah
yeah
oh wow
sure
yeah
yeah well uh i i can tell by your accent that you're a Texan and you know i miss hearing that [laughter] they used to make fun of me because of being you know my accent
they they try to get me to say things because they they thought i talked so funny
but you sound just like um the the children that i worked with up there the same type of voice
[laughter]
yeah right [laughter] like oil [laughter] or oil [laughter] that's true [laughter] well listen it was nice speaking with you
okay Jim
take care
bye-bye
[noise]
okay
i have four
i have uh three boys and one girl the girl's adopted
yeah
uh yeah i got two grandchildren
[laughter]
yeah uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah my kids were involved in sports
football and baseball and
whatever
but uh
oh yeah
when they were growing up we di- we were out in the middle of a desert out in Ridgecrest California
huh
yeah
yeah there wasn't a lot of other things for them to do
and uh so when when they participated in sports or whatever well uh all nearly all the parents went
yeah
yeah
yeah
we came back when they were teenagers
and of course uh then they came to the big city as teenagers and that the time with them wasn't as much as it was when they were out there in the small
town out in the middle of the desert
yeah
right
yeah
gosh our our kids were fortunate they had good good other kids to play with
uh
maybe it's not like it is nowadays really when there's so much uh some drugs and everything else
yeah i would not want to raise a a child today
from scra- you know from start
yeah
no it's a necessity
it's a
yeah yeah i w- uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i i i told my wife that uh i don't know what young kids just starting out nowadays especially if they have uh
have some children if if they're trying to buy a house both of them have to work in order to pay for a house
uh and the kids really spend more time at school or with a babysitter then they do with their parents
yep
yeah
yeah yeah i told
uh-huh
yeah
yeah well kids nowadays they want to start out with a
three bedroom brick house
and when we started out well we started out in first of all in an apartment and then rented a a duplex
and then went from a duplex to a little old two bedroom frame house
but uh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh i'm i'm i really feel for young parents nowadays
i i just don't uh see how
yeah
yeah
yeah they brought that up at TI i don't know how many times to to uh have a day care
for working mothers but uh TI never has seen fit to do it
but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do
yeah
yeah
well do you work at a Attleboro or does your or your husband
oh you do
okay
oh well of course i always see see uh Attleboro mission on teen news and everything else but
never been up there
yeah
yeah i started to say what what's the temperature up there now
in the thirties
oh bo-
oh me
well we're supposed to get rain but no [laughter] snow
but we're we're in the sixties and seventies
in the daytime
[laughter] we
yeah
yeah
well the colds and the flu have been going around down here
oh man i'm telling you everybody's and i think it's really the weather it will it will get warm one day and then not real cold but pretty cool the next day and then warm the next day
and it's just uh plus there's been an awfully lot of uh
uh mountain cedar and everything else in the air
and it's really driving people with sinuses crazy and
and sore throats and colds and whatever
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah i remem- i remember when i was out at Ridgecrest somebody had a flat and uh i asked them i said do you have a tire tool in the in the trunk
and he said a what and i said a tire tool
he said you mean a T A R tool and i said no a T I R E tool [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
nice talking to you Irene and you stay warm up there
okay
bye-bye
[noise]
what would you do about this pressing problem
[laughter]
oh
[laughter]
so with the band
what do you play
my uh
my husband played music he was involved in music all of his life and went to Notre Dame where he decided he was going to have a good time [laughter]
and never [laughter] and then [laughter] never went into the scholastic bands he went into uh
bands on campus and he played music but i i just can't believe that [laughter] he didn't can play in a Notre Dame band [laughter] when he was good enough to do it
he went the other route i think uh i think the advise i'd give to parents would be to start when they're like four years old today [laughter]
yeah at least start saving and and start routing them to where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead
yeah that's
it's um
i wish i had known more when i was uh
choosing a college i i kind of did or i'd i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to
the University of Utah and didn't find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State and so i kind of do what you did only by route of another school and
i wish i had known more about what a school meant
[laughter]
oh
right
well it still is
i was just looking at a job sheet that's about all that's in there
[laughter]
do you think it do you think it's well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school
right right the reputation that they have a good reputation
um some of these i didn't the college i went to was a big school but i was an English major and it the English major is very small so i had the
benefit of being able to talk to my professors and hangout with them you know and i really appreciated that
right
i think that's what i would tell parents
[laughter]
hey i'm headed there
[laughter]
well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that
it's the closest thing to a humanities degree that they let you do at night
it's not the i i'm not into the Bohemian thing you know were i waitress during at night and go to school during the day
[laughter]
no i i agree [laughter] but but it's like oh you offer this degree okay i'll go
[laughter]
i've always wanted a masters degree but to get one in in English or anything other than an MBA it's really difficult to do at night
yeah
right
it's true
and and just lived the easy life
[laughter]
that's true
oh it it would be wonderful
i know the little dreams [laughter]
right
right
that's true yeah
i i uh i picked up sweats for the track team i was the track track team manager we got i got to ride the bus all over the state [laughter] i got to see everything [laughter]
so it was fun it was li- i did that for a long time it was a lot of fun so i understand that
yeah
[laughter]
yeah that's true
yeah that was a good thing to look out for
well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame
[laughter]
but he's really happy he went there
wow
right
yeah
yeah
but we had fun
[laughter]
uh i really i miss college i had a good time
yeah
it was fun
well i'll just wrap this up
now that we've done our conversation for tonight [laughter]
[laughter]
hopefully i i gue- i don't know what they're doing with the conversations
aren't aren't they like put taking the words and and listening to the dialect and yeah
that's funny
that would be interesting well it was good talking to you
okay thanks a lot bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i can relate to uh when i decided to choose a college
uh it really had very little to do with academics [laughter]
uh i i stayed at a i went to a local uh university that was close to home it's about sixty miles away went to the University of Wisconsin
and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference i joined the marching band
and uh that really was uh a good deal of the motivation for going to that uh college
yeah something to do extracurricular activity
i play the trumpet
[laughter]
okay
uh-huh
at least start saving
well i think most people when they are in high school are very undecided about what course of study they want to take
and they really don't have the foggiest idea of what kind of career they want to get into at least until at least until they've been in college for a couple of years
uh-huh
yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school
and uh by the time i was a sophomore i decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good job they weren't hiring mathematicians at the time
so i started taking computer science courses and uh that become my major course of study uh i finished a major in mathematics also i had a double major but uh computer science is what got me a job
and it was very uh very much in demand for a career
uh still is that's true it's uh very good choice
um-hum
so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now
uh i really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and they're uh
uh
well known throughout the country
uh-huh
yeah
well that does make a difference uh
Wisconsin had a very good reputation in uh computer science and engineering departments and i'm sure that helped uh helped me get job offers
uh if you choose a school that's not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it
kind of like uh going to SMU they have a reputation as being a party school
and uh
i just
[laughter]
i have to question how worthwhile it is to go to a school that uh really isn't uh that well known for their academics
[laughter] i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself
right
okay
uh-huh
yeah [laughter] i was just mak- making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and
uh-huh
yeah that that's true uh
i i took uh like i said i took uh couple of semesters at SMU and it at SMU in uh engineering courses
but uh it really did conflict too much with uh with my work it's very difficult uh to maintain a full-time job and try to take uh courses uh in off hours
so i quit doing that several years ago
well yeah somewhat [laughter] i wouldn't mind going back to school again if i thought it i wasn't going to get in trouble again with the with the work it just takes too much time
going back full-time i think is is the way to go
yeah if one can afford to do that that's back to the reason why why i joined the band that was my entertainment while i was in school
going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games
uh because when you're a poor starving student you don't have the uh cash flow to uh entertain yourself [laughter] you have to find whatever means you can
those events were always free
[laughter]
that sounds exciting
uh-huh
i'd recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country
and uh go from there
the rest of it's just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by
i mean uh Wisconsin was only up uh sixty mile bus ride away from my parents house so it only took an hour to get back on uh oh a couple weekends a semester
it was very convenient
not to mention being a public university it was the tuition was uh much less expensive
i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years
um-hum yeah i'm sure that that's uh it's not uh cheap either
well that's good
i i got uh by with the minimal amount of financial aid and was able to pay it all off within two years of graduation
so i was very pleased with that of course i lived like a pauper too during that time
i know a lot of people that did most couldn't afford to to go to a movie
it was uh really living on a budget
forced you to learn a few things that's true
tried to have fun being in the band was about the only entertainment i had
that was fun uh lived on Tombstone pizzas and Coca-Cola [laughter]
okay
well wonder if if this advice was uh worth following for uh choosing a school [laughter]
they're being recorded and uh oh put in uh i guess in Washington DC somewhere for reference for speech projects
yeah that is true based on where where you come from and all
where you're educated in the first uh ten years i guess
okay i appreciate it enjoyed it all right bye
[noise]
[noise]
do you
yeah i don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows
and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening
i always try to read the Sunday paper
just because it usually gives a summary of the the week's hot events
so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else
for for local news i think we do real well where it's we live in a kind of small town
but i think we get excellent local coverage um
and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job
so i'm i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get
how about you
right
uh-huh
yeah
but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries
because i'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions
i don't really need their help to do that
i don't think radio is as bad to do that as TV is
um-hum
right
i used to but i don't anymore maybe once or twice a year
uh-huh
really
yes
yeah
well i had heard a couple of people
you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what Sixty Minutes presented
and that they didn't present it nearly the same way
as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with
so i started questioning
just how how bias they really were
so
hum
no not really you know in the last few years just his
kind of informal segments i've seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i- i did grow up with David Brinkley
uh
uh-huh
yeah we we used to watch um him and i guess John Chancellor
and i always liked David Brinkley and i- and i used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting
but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that's where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries
so
right
what did you think of the news coverage of the war
um-hum
really
[laughter]
did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military
did
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize
discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on
okay
what weekly um magazine do you look at is it
uh-huh
sure
does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories
yeah
that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick
right
right
well we're working on a Newsweek
uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory subscription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like
Glamour or Sports Illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was
a little bit better for us so to speak
it can't hurt
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
no
i- i even i enjoy reading T News
i try to catch it
because it's another example they just they just show you the words and the facts
and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day
because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all
so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything
yeah
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code
and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update
it will give you um updated information
so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge
so that's an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use
it
it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about
so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it's it's catching on throughout the country
[noise]
[noise] normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day
and then i supplement that with uh
radio news
from my car radio
and from a news magazine
once a week
and a newspaper if i have time
that's true and and how do you rate the uh h- are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving
on the whole i'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves
um
since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite
uh i think i'm fed up with trite
there seems to be more and more of it
and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both
radio presentations and television presentations and a- as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace
i [vocalized-noise] i we're certainly in agreement there
uh
radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done they're maybe they're a little more efficient
or have more to do over that same time frame i don't know which that answer is
uh i think the
my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like Sixty Minutes do you watch that
well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did
two programs uh that i knew
both the people and the inc- incidences
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint
that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings
and it ever since that time i just don't watch
uh so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not
i don't know di- i don't know how old you are but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite
so i don't i don't know if you're familiar with him or not
well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold
of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years
well once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore
well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening
uh
[vocalized-noise]
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst
and i don't need their
fill-ins you know [laughter]
yes but i- i think it helps me everyday in trying to review
wh- the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going
well i- i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with Sixty Minutes
i like US News and World Report at one time or another i've
taken them all for a year i believe in giving anything a chance
uh but i keep coming back to that one
so i that's kind of my favorite
it's primarily um a few big stories
and then lots of high-level reports
uh here's what went on in Asia over the past week and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs
unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories
uh it too is one those you know [vocalized-noise] in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and i do most of my reading in the bathroom
um and it's one of those that i can ei- read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there
and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days
well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway
well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt
oh i'm with you i have to check T News every everyday
it's my noontime dose of facts
no
hum
well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that
okay
so what do you think about it should
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes um it's it's funny because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know i know someone that w- works in all three different stages like you said
and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building they we call it um
well we have high rises and it's just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away
and it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through
and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing
but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing
and to actually sit so it's really nice to see that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah um i'm in college and i'm i'm only twenty one but we had a spee- i had a speech class last semester and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly
and i was so surprised to hear how many people like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the halls
and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine and so many of them you know are
yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through And i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i know and some and sometimes they share a room and it's just a little cubbyhole and they share it with another person and they're still paying that much it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous
uh-huh uh-huh yeah um i've been lucky well
my mom's um parents they're both in their
in their uh eighties and i was just home for spring break and my grandma said something to me about she goes well maybe we'll just sell the house she said it's getting too big for us to take care of and i was like no no no stay in the house as long as you can
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
it sounds like uh an apartment or some
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
oh really
see now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were well i've lived here for thirty years and we've built this and this is our home and we have nothing else to show for our lives and we don't want to leave uh we've run into a lot of that
um
yeah
uh-huh yeah that's what like well um
now i know we have an old we call it an old folks home but it's basically a nursing home too but everyone has basically their own room
and they're allow you know th- none of them have cars because they can't drive
but if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them and there's a staff there that makes supper for them and each person has a chore like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables
and it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around and i know um our youth group goes over and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that
uh-huh yeah just to keep them going
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
but i think before i- like you i don't think y- i don't think it's right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it
well yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
[noise]
[noise]
okay
um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing
choi- the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldn't take them in your own home then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived
too far away to care for them or your daily job or whatever prevented it
but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care
and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is
you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care
you know where some people can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed and they can't get around but then they have full care but i really like those those options now and and i think about it more often because my husband's parents
are they're very active right now but they're seventy five and and seventy two
so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah that's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests and uh and the programs here they have different
uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs they have several areas they have one area in town where the people
i guess a lot of it comes with money it this this one area is a bit more expensive and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life but but things that people where they have similar interests
like you're saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there
and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it's
you know maybe it's thirty minutes away because it's a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy
personally if i had to live there because i don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home
so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um
enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
are overmedicated too
uh-huh yeah that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires
to uh be in one of these places because some of these people that are just on social security and if they don't have any living relatives perhaps they never had children or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are
you know that that are not good where they they have very minimum minimal care and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it
are pro- are paid at a minimum wage and they just do they don't care as much and and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves
to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in fee
yeah
oh yeah so you've
yeah you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care
what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time
[laughter]
well like there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home i had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that um was in a
it was a it was a housing division each person had their own little bitty house that they had built and it was um
supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government but it was this little bitty one bedroom house
but it was a separate house and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom
so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised th- all these houses were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block and they had a a supervisory um
wasn't a house really it was it was more like a
a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ring and and someone could come to their house
and that and they always cooked then they had they had the choice you know they lived in their own little house they had their own possessions still in there to some ex- you know some of them
and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner and they always had somebody come in for lunch
but they had people who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard they had people who did the yard and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's house so they didn't have to worry about that and it was really a nice
it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't
[noise]
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it would be hard to that's that's why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff
and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available
yeah
uh-huh
huh
yeah
well that's good
everybody needs some sense of responsibility
an even even if it's just a little bit yeah
so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice
yes unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapaci-
[noise] say like you're saying with Alzheimer's and [vocalized-noise]
going to be
[noise]
the people who have to be there
[noise]
that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without or
[noise]
overdoing it
[noise]
so
[noise]
[noise]
okay
who do you think [laughter] the Dallas Cowboys
yeah
um-hum
yeah they're going to get better
i mean you know
yeah as long as Troy [vocalized-noise] Aikman doesn't get hurt again
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year
so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually
okay i think i did know that
i just forgot
okay
yeah has Herschel Walker done much for them
definitely well he was a good player i guess
i don't know he just never
i don't know for a while there he just [vocalized-noise]
well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone
but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team
and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team but
i don't know
Emmitt Smith yeah he's been doing real good
i'm pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go
yeah i kind of i haven't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i- i can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that
but uh
[laughter]
yeah
um i have no idea
no earthly idea
how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the play-offs at all
um
um-hum
kind of like the Cowboys huh
except i think the Cowboys are on the upswing i don't know about the Vikings
just hadn't heard much about them lately
yeah
well the Cardinals i don't know [laughter] i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because uh Laufenberg just couldn't never really get it together
at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot
well
i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean
he didn't get to see much action but it's too bad
because now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more
in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something
a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of
but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin
[vocalized-noise] he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder
uh back in shape it was his shoulder wasn't it [laughter] that he had problems with
i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway they're trying to keep him
you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but
anyway [laughter]
thirty day notice for what
oh really
what [laughter] oh okay [laughter] maybe i'll call you back after [laughter] after the recording is finished
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i- i can't remember
really i usually have too
yeah i've done that once or twice
i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in
yeah
so other than the Vikings who do you like
uh oh
yeah
um-hum
back when they were in Saint Louis
[laughter] since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh
all that impressive i guess
i guess i've always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kind of tend to
get caught up in it
yeah
yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the Cowboys were really big because my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and
you know the hype were just unbelievable it's just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty four
about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so
i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to
that are going to uh do pretty good i think
but they're raising prices on their tickets so they're banking on doing good next season
i think tickets are yeah
thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else
and now they're sectioning it off to like from the
from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones
but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up even more or less is what it's going to do
um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't
i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper
but not that i'll ever go i hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um
if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn't a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of
you know it was kind of different i guess and before that it's been quite a few years i've been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it
so maybe this year
Texans [noise] cheap cheaper i guess [noise] [laughter] [noise]
so who's your uh favorite team
the Dallas Cowgirls huh
well [noise] they did have a fairly decent year finally this year
at least they're coming around
well i mean you know i think uh once Jimmy Johnson
gets his system established uh
they'll do all right
um-hum
i'm a Viking fan
and they haven't been doing too hot so
no
in fact
in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal
[noise] i've never been over impressed with him
well who's the running back is it Sammy Smith or is it Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith
yeah
i'm not sure
uh who else is uh
uh there's you know Mike Lynn from the Minnesota Vikings he used to be the general manager starting the World Football League
some uh
and th- and he was trying to keep uh
uh
uh i can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the Vikings
Burt Jerry Burns
going to keep [vocalized-noise] he was going to keep him as the coach somehow
but uh
i don't know i'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow
well they started out really bad they went like one and six and then they won five or six in a row
so they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games
yep
i guess you can
[noise]
yeah
and the Cardinals were kind of like the Cow- in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys and the Cowboy Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the Cardinals
got killed by the Cowboys so
oh don't make any excuses for him [laughter]
um-hum
uh-huh
i don't know [noise] yeah think it was
but uh
well i got my uh thirty day notice yesterday
um i'm done
where i work
so
anyway i guess we can't talk much more about that but i just thought i'd throw that in there [laughter]
oh we i've always ran out of time ever since i've done this
they always say you've talked your ten minute limit
make sure we get our cash flow
[laughter]
um
actually when i was younger i was a Cardinal fan too remember Jim Hart
Jim Hart was playing Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals this was a long time ago
uh
i don't know who else i've ever
that's about it i was always a Viking fan i think i was into the Cardinals for a little bit
and
and yeah oh of course
yeah well the Cowboys were America's football team there's no question about that so
[noise]
again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year
[noise] that's interesting i almost lost our electricity here [noise]
hello hello did i reach the Dallas area
yeah that's what
my name is Fernando
hey how's it going do you work for TI
North Carolina State University
yep
i'm getting a Master's in computer science and computer engineering
um i took a voice IO course
well uh one of my teachers went to a to this conference up in Bethesda Maryland
and so he saw it there and he just said you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so
uh not originally
Argentina
yeah
uh well i used to live up in New York and Maryland and i uh i like i like bigger cities i like i like more populated areas because i used to live in Buenos Aires but they have ten million people
but uh this area is nice it looks like it's got a lot of uh job opportunities especially at Research Triangle Park
and so it looks it looks well it's the third largest growing area in the country for businesses
yeah yeah
no North Carolina State
yeah no the Wolf Pack
yeah no we're we're not we're not the Tar Heels
[laughter]
wh- why do you run
oh okay my dad is too
yeah yeah it's nice
yeah
it's it's clothing
right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season
and from day to day
okay
okay ready i'm going to press the one
no then then we say bye and uh i- i prob-
well i i got a stopwatch here
so i'll probably say you know it's like well we've been talking for five six minutes so okay
well uh we'll just open it okay i'll press the one ready
okay [noise]
[noise] okay so well you see since i don't work i just go you know to class it all depends because i like to wear like sweat pants
because it's more comfortable for me but you know it's like when you're in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
okay are they like T-shirts or are they like do they have [vocalized-noise]
oh okay
well
because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it
yeah yeah that's
well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it
and then you know you'd but what happens is uh what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere
okay
and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and black turtlenecks or white turtlenecks
and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans
but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody [noise] wears jeans and if not [noise] what the [noise] what the thing is that they're wearing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it
which is
[laughter]
yeah
where at
where at
oh okay
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
but the thing is when you started with TI was it as big as a company as it is now
yeah
yeah which is which is bas- i mean when hello
you probably got wait calling
okay
well i guess i'm supposed to talk alone while he's on the wait call about clothing right
so i don't know what to say i don't wear any clothing
we're at nudist camp we don't wear any clothes here
yeah oh that's okay
yeah
was that in the seventies
no no but uh when i- it had gone up
yeah yeah i re-
i- i qui- i sort of remember that i'm only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know TI was even making uh those little watches you know those those uh LED watches that you couldn't see in the sun
yeah
[laughter]
so
yeah
well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me
yeah i mean women go all i mean what i've seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me it's like people know how i dress and w- we have you know like the gym here
they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one
and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in
so i mean you don't feel as bad because it's like they they give you different year sometime you know so you're wearing you know sometimes you're wearing eighty nine the other times you're wearing ninety one the other times you're wearing you know eighty six so it's okay you know
right see when we take PE you have to dress in the in PE clothes but it i- it's issued to any one that wants one that's in the university
well right now since i'm graduating i'm o-
[noise]
hello
you sure did to to whom am i speaking
hi Fernando i'm Bill
yeah yeah where you calling from
oh for goodness sakes that's great great you a student there
h- what do you do
uh that's great how did you get introduced to this program
oh okay i just saw there was an advertisement within TI to sign up for it and i just i just uh signed up for it
um-hum
yeah yeah uh uh F- uh uh Fernando are you from [noise] excuse me you from the North Carolina area
oh where are you from originally
Argentina oh my goodness how do you like North Carolina
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i like the pine trees
yeah i've i've been over there from time to time uh you're you're at the University of North Carolina
oh oh North okay NC State the wildcats
no
Wolf Pack okay the Wolf
yeah i knew you weren't the Tar Heels uh no somebody gave me a pair of running shorts and with the logo on it and i thought it was a wildcat but it was a wolf yeah
for the N C State uh Wolf Pack
yeah i'm a runner
in fact i went up there visiting i had a friend at Davidson one time and i went up there visiting him and and he took me out running through the trails in the piney woods up there and i just loved it
so [noise] well what are we supposed to i- i was kind of fumbling this was the first i haven't been home other nights when they've called so this is the first time i've participated
and uh uh and i- i was fumbling for my uh pin number uh when she was talking about what to talk about and what are we supposed to discuss
yeah uh how you dress to go to work or something like that
oh
[noise]
okay well i'm ready any time you are sir
hey uh how does this work Fernando do we talk for five minutes and does somebody cut us off or
uh how do we know how do we know when the time's up
oh okay
[vocalized-noise]
okay you want to go first or me
okay
ready one
yeah
yeah uh you know i- i- i can remember back to my college days
and uh it was uh T-shirts and jeans in the warm weather and jackets and jeans in the short weather uh the thing is here i'm i'm supposed to be an executive you you can uh uh take that or or not depends on where you're looking from
and however and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties well many do but i am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie
i carry one in my briefcase and i wear it i wear it when the occasion demands if somebody important is coming to visit well i take it out and put it on
uh i wear a sport jacket sometimes and i wear uh well reasonably not not real dressy dressy pants but but reasonably decent reasonably decent pants
and uh c- comfortable that way and a good loose fitting pair of shoes that i take off under tables when i'm in a conference room because i can't stand having anything on my feet
and uh say i like my shirt and short i wear short sleeved shirts all year round i just
ye- yeah no no short sleeved sort of semi dress shirt
but i- i- i absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows and when i'm working and and i mean that's even in the winter time
well we'll have a day or two that it'll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before Christmas
but at uh uh normally it'll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and we've experienced some seventies here uh to eighties recently
but i- i don't ever feel the need to dress that warmly i- i don't have to travel that far to work uh what what what what about uh your clothes in the winter time up there
um-hum
my goodness i i've not see that at all
um-hum
yeah
yeah
okay [vocalized-noise] that that sounds pretty good uh it sounds like it's a very relaxed atmosphere on campus you know i've uh i've uh always TI is a very informal company
uh i- i think the thing that i've noticed in more recent years there's more ties and jackets and shirts as the young- the younger crowd seems to want to dress those of us i've been here thirty two years those of us been here for a long time don't care to dress up
but when we came to work i was told that the president of the company set the standard of dress and he's he dressed like the janitor so we all we all did
and the feeling has always been that without the shirts and ties and suit coats that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere and you could have a freer exchange of information
and i've seen this [noise] actually i spent seven years overseas with TI and while i was gone
uh Malaysia four years in Malaysia and three years in the Philippines
and and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in TI for the first time
what was interesting Malaysia is a tropical country just uh two degrees above the equator
and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them
[vocalized-noise] i absolutely never wore anything out in the tropics like a necktie
oh no no uh i think it was somethi- i started in nineteen fifty nine we're talking about at the most eight to nine thousand people world wide and at that time the whole world was right here in Dallas as far as TI was concerned
[noise]
uh is that uh i'm sorry that's
yeah i got a wait call hang on a second
[noise]
[noise] you still there Fernando yeah i'm sorry uh
and anyway uh where uh oh we're talking about the size of the company yeah it was uh about eight or nine thousand people when i got here it has in the past gotten up to eighty six thousand we're not we're not that high right now
but uh in in many many many many countries or
uh no i started in nineteen fifty nine i
oh yeah yeah yeah it peaked out in the seventies yes yeah i've i've i've got thirty two years in
okay
right
right right we made those
yeah yeah yeah i used to referee soccer games and uh uh i would use those watches to time the games and i'd be out on the field middle of the field at high noon
and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see what time it was
and uh yeah we were about the first ones to make those and went out of that business in nineteen eighty one
uh back to uh uh back to clothes i don't really i don't really have what you'd you'd think was an expensive wardrobe i mean some people are very very very clothes conscious uh
huh
um-hum um-hum
yeah i wouldn't i- i would think they'd spend at least that as th- at the cost of clothes
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
is that for like gym classes for PE classes and things like that
yeah
yeah
right right right how many hours are you taking
[noise]
hello
did i reach the Dallas area
did i reach the Dallas area
Dayton Ohio i'm from North Carolina
in Raleigh
yeah
so
my name is Fernando
so um do you work how'd you find out about this
oh okay he works for TI
oh okay because i'm down at NC State
and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes
so are you ready
okay let's get started
[noise]
okay
so uh what do you think uh that uh wh- what wh- what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America
yeah but what what what are the steps
well see the problem is is that um
what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people
and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have
and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know [vocalized-noise] resell it
which one
yeah
that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere
right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints
and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it
[noise]
right right and so
um-hum
okay
yeah
yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent
the least amount of money on crime in America
and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it's like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what you're doing is
you you know it's like you have other things you know it's like you have the AIDS we're going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then
uh-huh
but those people never get caught the people that
that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive
but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me
you know it's like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you won't find me dealing in drugs i mean there's no connection between me and the people that you caught you know
right
yeah
yeah i was i was at a at a party on Saturday and this guy comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this guy was from Jamaica right and he's got his little brother selling drugs
you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie Good Fellas
did you see it
okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like
those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it
yeah
yeah that's that that was also in the movie yeah
so hello Mary
we've been talking for five minutes it was
all right okay same here bye-bye
[noise]
hello there
i beg your pardon
nope you've reached Dayton Ohio
oh you're from North Carolina where in North Carolina
Raleigh great my name's Mary
Fernando glad to know you
uh i was visiting my son down in Dallas
and uh no no but his wife has a contract with TI and that's how we learned about it um-hum
yeah um-hum
right [laughter]
i'm ready
all right okay
oh if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person
[vocalized-noise]
well you have to see i a as the way i look at it you have to think first of all why or has has crime increased and if so why has crime increased
um-hum
right
um-hum
it's easy you said the magic word there drugs
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
oh yes
yeah
now they don't want the money for food that's for sure
well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers
at that time trying to influence the high school kids because uh i'm a retired educator [noise]
and uh in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where i was
and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on
so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years and we're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge
hm
uh-huh
you know the uh another one of the problems is that the people who are
the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction
that's right they'll never get caught
um-hum
that's right but they'll
that's right
that's right then one person doesn't know the other person down the line
but the guy at the very top the one who's who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political
uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing because it sure is monstrous in this country
um-hum
um-hum
yeah right
nope i only heard about it
um-hum
yeah well you know even in our prison systems they're finding that they're they're having drugs smuggled into them
right
[vocalized-noise]
it's been nice talking
i beg your [vocalized-noise] we've been talking for a little bit i appreciate the call i enjoyed talking with you
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community
well
um-hum
well in our i live in a very small community outside of the Dallas area and uh we're just getting started as a matter of fact this last week we got a notice in the mail from City Hall
and they've informed us that uh we'd be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two but we're going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera
and apart of that we haven't really done much of anything except for uh separating your newspapers and taking those to uh an area that they've designated um
but in uh in the office place we've been doing it for some time separating our uh uh computer paper from our normal garbage
uh-huh
what do they do with the cans
um-hum
[noise] i would assume so and then maybe do something with the money for charity or something
i-
yeah that's a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um
i don't know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano it's a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse
and they've even um got a particular [noise] huge uh waste can that they have to use
right uh-huh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know
um-hum
oh uh-huh
other side that's a good idea
um-hum
i think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning don't you think
[noise]
oh really
um-hum
[noise] yeah i know the motor oil
we have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own oil at home i
[noise]
um KMart does that some of the KMarts in the area where i don't have any except for the lawn motor lawn mower
um machine oil because i always have my oil changed out of the house but
[noise] yes i'm sure they do uh
um-hum because that's something that doesn't go back into the soil does it doesn't break down
um-hum
is that right i had no idea
never breaks down
um the Styrofoam
yeah never did some
fifty years
um i know that i had heard that uh McDonald's has gotten so much flack about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work on something
other than that oh have they
um-hum
do they well good
i think they're one of the businesses at large that do things like that they're more aware of it
or at least they try and do something about it first
um-hum
i think you're right
um-hum
[laughter] defiantly if you live in an apartment right [laughter]
right that's for sure
well
uh i really don't know i haven't been timing it but i think
[noise]
oh okay [laughter]
oh all right
well i guess we'll just say good-bye then
okay
thank you nice to talk to you also
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
we- well in our area we just introduced the um citywide
uh Clean King Sport campaign and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo he's a kangaroo and um we're setting up [vocalized-noise] curbside recycling bins for the city home owners
and several of our local businesses also have recycling stations set up in their parking lots
and how about in your area
um-hum
all right so have we we've been doing the computer paper and then we've also been doing our aluminum cans
i that's the one thing i don't know i- i don't know if they take them to the local aluminum uh recycling plant
uh just locally or or what i assume that's what they would do
i would hope
yeah [vocalized-noise] i- i think that's what they do i think they they give that to charity
okay
oh for each different product oh okay
yeah
i- i was going to say i've seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs they've got trash can dividers for for home owners who don't have those it it
it like cuts [vocalized-noise] your trash can in half so you could put cans on one side and and other on the other side so
i think i think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon
um
as far as you know should more be done i think there's i think there's always more that can be done
yes i've even heard them talking about uh recycling Freon from refrigerators refrigeration systems yes there are pe- there are companies that recycle their Freon
and um [noise] i'm sure there are a lot chemicals that that can be recycled that
there's a lot of
um-hum
now that's we we don't have that that's neat
oh
uh-huh
but but you'd think that uh garages could do that
i mean that would be great
no it's it's really bad to not break down
i uh saw an article the other day in Ann Landers that talked about how long it takes like a cigarette butt to decompose and i think it was between twenty and thirty years
yes
i- i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down
that's the one that never did yep
plastic took fifty years
yeah
they they have here yes i used to get my Egg McMuffin in one of those little Styrofoam cup uh cups like and now they wrap them in paper
yes
so i was really glad to see that
they they are good
i think they recognize their their position as a community leader
and really work to keep that going
so and and the only other thing i've seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard
but that's that's hard if you don't have a big yard or if you live in an apartment [laughter]
[laughter]
that might not go over real well
so
let's see has it been i think have we been our five minutes
i know the last time i did this they came on and said
y- you have exceeded your ten minutes time limit hang up within the next thirty seconds so
um
okay and and i think we just hang up i don't think we have to do anything else
but it's been very nice talking to you okay
all righty bye-bye
[noise]
[noise] nope
and where are you
uh-huh well i guess the only people i've talked to before were from Texas so i
i was beginning to think that was the only people on the network
[laughter]
well what do you uh what are your favorite television shows
LA Law yeah that's a very popular one around my office but i've never seen it
never have seen it
i
well i can go even better than that i've never seen Dallas either [laughter]
never once
[laughter]
well i think i just sort of uh
didn't start watching it and then felt like i would have been way too late getting in on the action to figure out what was going on so i never did get involved in it
um-hum
oh who killed JR
oh
oh yes yes i remember reading about that thinking uh i would have just strangled them [laughter]
[laughter]
yes
i think that's right i think they just lost their uh inspiration for a while
yeah somebody said that uh JR is going to die and that will be end of the season forever i mean the end of the show forever
well it's about time huh
too bad they didn't kill him the first time
um-hum
oh well i mostly watch public television so yeah i'm one of those i uh
well i love Masterpiece Theatre
and i love the mystery series
oh yes oh
oh
oh we
uh-huh
we have uh uh a local station uh on our cable network here that uh is showing all the Miss Marples over again so we got to repeat them
i
i think it is A&E
um-hum
oh they do have some absolutely gorgeous things so uh but they uh the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the weekend was the Gardens of the World did you see that one this week
uh well
we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels
so we get
we get things over and over so if we miss them we can catch them later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was
uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it
and they took you all over uh
started in Italy went to England France some in America uh also Japan anyway it was a really a a visual treat
is that right
uh well uh
when i was in Houston there was one station of just uh
it was uh the University of Houston station
[noise] and uh so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the country were getting because [vocalized-noise] each station gets its own mix
but when i moved to California and all of a sudden i had this uh
surfeit of public television
we can get all sorts of things everything from i guess on Saturday there you can watch something like eight different cooking shows
so i don't but i could if i felt like it
um-hum
really i would have thought that was close enough that
or you got a hill between you or something like that
well the onl- about the only things i watch on commercial television are Thirty Something and Twin Peaks uh and i just discovered that they uh have have canceled both of those so
well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe it's time for it to quit i they've gone downhill too
well the thing i liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you couldn't predict what was coming next
that's right and this one had all sorts of weird little things and would go off in uh strange directions and it had lots of
uh little subtle touches that if you weren't watching you would miss uh that
they'd have references to literature and things like that and they'd also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the table in the bank vault
and there's no explanation for it they treat it as perfectly normal and somebody says what's the deer head doing here and they said oh it fell off the wall so why was it doing on the wall
and in one case the fellow was making coffee and they said there's a fish in the coffee pot
well
i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but
anyway
it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it
um-hum
um-hum
um
well they
yeah i'd say probably what i watch the most faithfully is the news which i really don't watch as much as i just listen to it
when i'm fixing dinner or something like that it's i uh at least know if there's anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper
[laughter]
i get the headlines off the television
yeah
um-hum
uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor
that we could only get about three stations and uh only one was a public station and we had a
San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them was very clear they were both
barely adequate
so we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so we could see what we were watching if we watched anything at all
um-hum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything without the cable
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
they have had some absolutely wonderful shows and they do they have incredibly good what are called production values they have
really well researched uh locations and sets and costumes and so forth and as far as i can tell on places where i have some knowledge their historical research is excellent
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
first one i've had from California
uh North Carolina
[laughter]
yeah mine me too and i ha-
yeah they all work for TI too [laughter]
[noise]
well first and foremost it's got to be LA Law
yeah
never
[noise]
my goodness it's hard to belie- i didn't think there was anybody in the country who hadn't seen that one
[noise]
never
gosh
[noise]
i admit that i used to be hooked on Dallas but back way long time ago when Jock died i gave up watching it it just got too funny
well i think the writers had the same problem
yeah
i mean th- they went for an entire season with this
and i'm sure you heard about it all these things
all these things going on no this was i think it was before or after that
but they went for this whole season and they had all these situations
and then to end the season come to find out Pam it was all a dream
you remember that i mean an
and then oh i- i tell you that just did it for me right there i said you've put me through an entire season of Pam dreaming
you know you writers are coming you know you're having a hard time here
well i understand that this is the last season for it
uh i- i read something in the paper
yeah that's
yeah they uh i read something in the paper today talking ab- or it was Parade magazine yesterday and they said you know when's the last episode and what's going to happen and they say insiders say JR is going to get knocked off
good
about time
yeah too bad they didn't get away with it shoot
well anyway what's your favorites
no i- i that's what i spend most of my time watching that uh
oh yeah
yeah mystery especially uh Miss Marple
i i've i've got all the videos that i can get my hands on of of Miss Marple
yeah i love those i used to i- i lived in England for about four years so it really brings back
some memories
it must be either uh A&E or um
uh Dis- Discovery
yeah A&E runs quite a lot of them
um i like Discovery Channel too i like they have lots of wildlife shows and
yeah
hum-um no i missed it
nice i bet
um boy that is that is good
i bet it was
um [noise] i like her
oh i like th-
um
really nice i bet
i bet
yeah the interesting thing about public TV is it's not public around here you have to have cable to get it
um-hum
silly
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah i- i spend a lot of time down in Charlotte uh and on their just the the regular TV not cable you can pick up four PB or three PBS channels
but uh
the closest one to Raleigh is in uh Chapel Hill which is about twenty five miles away and believe it or not you can't pick it up
yeah
it was it should be close enough but i guess they have the antennas pointing it the other way or something
but
yeah it's uh it just you can barely see the picture and you can't hear anything so
oh really yeah i've i've never seen either one of them
oh
well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation
well at least that that's what i like about a show if if you can predict it it's not worth watching
um
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
sounds like a pretty good show i'm sorr- sorry i m-
sorry i missed that one
you know i- i don't watch very much TV i- i watch um LA Law
and i watch Sixty Minutes
and America's Funniest Home Videos
and that's about it
and i watch the i sometimes watch the the news
yeah back well when i had cable i used to just keep it on CNN not to watch it but just to have it in the background because i'd always listen to it
um-hum
right
yeah the uh cable prices are just too high nowadays and i'm not going to
i- i just won't pay that that kind of money for for what i'm getting i mean i miss A&E and i miss Discovery and i miss CNN but that's it
uh and it just it just wasn't worth it just to get those three
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah well
right
yeah i'd i'd probably i'd probably get cable but i've got we got the the three networks and two local stations and that
fulfills my needs because i don't watch TV that much anyway anymore anyway
[noise] yeah
yeah
i know what you mean course like i say the only thing i do miss is PBS because i there several things on there i like Masterpiece Theatre Mystery
especially those
uh Masterpiece Theatre is really good
yeah and and you
yeah
um-hum
yeah [vocalized-noise]
okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute [laughter] well credit cards boy that's an easy topic isn't it [laughter]
oh yes yes i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them
uh-huh
well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want [laughter]
you now not need want [laughter]
there's a big difference there
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
uh-huh
oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least that's for me
yeah
but yeah i've i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet not bad you know i just i'm just shocked at the end of the month
to see what damage i have did but
[laughter]
i try to keep it pretty reasonable
uh-huh
yeah
huh
and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest it's like paying twice
yes
so but
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now we're just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
yeah
pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
it sure does
uh-huh
but yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i've enjoyed talking to you
and maybe we'll get to talk again okay bye-bye
[noise]
okay
okay
is it yes it is [laughter] it's one we all hold dear and near i'm sure
yeah most of mine's been pretty good although i'm i guess i'm like a lot of other people now i'm trying to to pay off my credit cards and
i've done pretty good at it
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh there is a big difference
yeah yeah
yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them i've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas it's too easy to to run into the gas station
yeah what you
uh-huh
yeah yeah
so
yeah well
[laughter]
yeah yeah
well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to
to not charge except for emergencies
so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have uh wonderful features they're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever
yeah they ta- talks with [vocalized-noise]
that's true that's true
i try to i did switch to one uh
sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest
yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i'll just pay on it this month and [laughter]
yeah
takes a long time that's right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know
of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so
so
well i've enjoyed talking to you
okay
bye-bye
[noise]
in Rhode Island
yeah i you know i'm not sure if we have the death penalty here
to be perfectly honest with you hold on a second
do we have the death penalty in Rhode Island no okay no we don't
but you know um
i- i have some feelings about it in the sense that
i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
and it's a really heinous crime
i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye
yeah you know something really a serial killer or
you know someone who who really has no remorse
you know that that just does these things uh
i don't know without feeling guilty about it at all you know and the and their
we in fact we have an example going on right now with this uh school teacher involved some teenagers
into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband
i don't know if you're familiar with it Pamela Smart in New Hampshire
see now in a situation like that the boys are only sixteen years old and they were sexually involved with her
and i think like at that particular point she was twenty three
you know so she wasn't really that much older than them
and being a boy at that age i think that they're very
um you know let's face it that's at a point in your life when you you're just starting to realize all the things of life
i think she probably had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that
if it wasn't for the crime of passion type of thing
an-
uh-huh
yeah
now see i agree with that i- i don't think a person should be electrocuted or
hung or you know i- in other words i believe that they should be punished and done away with
on one hand like i say if they're if they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
but if there's
the the other the other hand where you say you know if there's just that slim chance that they didn't do it
and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment
then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty
you know
yeah
oh that's the cheerleader thing
oh yes that was on TV here
it made national um
yeah really
but you know i- i- i saw i can't figure out what people are doing any more
i mean it's getting so bad
and i don't think unless that the cri- that the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something because they know they'll be punished
you know what i'm saying
yeah a- you know a- i- i don't know if it would be
but i mean we don't know that it wouldn't either
yeah
and the other point someone made at one one time was that
if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or they're a serial killer or mass murderer
that if they're in prison that gives you the chance to um get into the person's mind
to find out uh what led them to the point that they were at when they committed the crime
to uh try to understand how their mind worked to prevent
uh you know another person from getting into the same situation
but i don't know you know [vocalized-noise] maybe you could do that for a certain period of time
but i mean how long does that kind of a thing take
you know to to um say to question the person or to get into their head
you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what they're doing
you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there
the prisons are overcrowded
it costs the taxpayers a lot of money
yeah [vocalized-noise] i'll tell you in the state of Rhode Island it was so bad
that the intake center that they have to house the the criminals before they go to the uh penitentiaries and stuff
um were overcrowded and the judge fined the state thousands of dollars a day
to build a bigger intake center
so i mean it it's like where does this all stop
exactly same thing here and that's that's what they did
yep
in fact the news tonight they had uh someone come on a seventy three year old man
they they had gotten into a housing for the elderly and and the person who perpetrated the crime went in with someone who had a relative there
and uh apparently this this person was on drugs and the old man was an invalid and he was in an elevator and he died for twelve dollars
yep
yeah and i also think that the uh fact that a lot of mothers are working today
and that children are not bonded to the parents
and other people take the responsibility for raising these kids or the children are left out
you know
on their own and they don't really feel the family um closeness that we had when oh when i was growing up
my my mother didn't work you know [vocalized-noise] and when she did uh a part time job she was there
you know it wasn't like she
getting mothers back in the home
you know kind of
oh i know i know
how do you feel about it do you do you think there should be capital punishment
yeah i- i do myself i really think that it's it's all well and good to um be a do-gooder or to to um
you know try to spare everyone's life but when someone has no regard for another person
[noise] excuse me their property or their personal
uh being or their families i mean you know when whole families are killed and
and and yet you have someone who'll commit a crime of robbery and spend twenty five years in jail
i mean to me it's like we have things messed up somehow
y- you know what i mean
and a- like this banking crisis thing where people have stolen millions of dollars and they're out walking around
i think all our laws are are really screwed up
i do i- i don't know what to do about it i wish i did
but uh
yeah
yeah exactly
morals yeah
did you ever see the program uh Why Does Johnny Kill
about these young children who
we- were not even like sixteen years old they were eleven and twelve and fourteen and fifteen year olds and they they actually committed murders
and the question was whether to try them as adults or as children
and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary and things like that
that has to
yeah i- i mean what would you do in a situation like that you say well he's only ten years old
but the crime he committed is that of an adult
he made that decision
uh-huh
yeah
imagine so see this is what i'm saying and even with uh people who are mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged
it's so hard to get people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded
so you have people walking the streets that are child molesters
or uh
[noise] well oh our topic is capital punishment
i guess uh
one thing is to compare uh how it is maybe here in Texas versus uh
maybe your part of the country
yeah
um-hum describing a heinous crime being like murder or
[noise] what other ones would be
uh-huh
um
don't think i've heard of that one
yeah
yeah we had one uh course in Texas they uh [laughter] used to string them up now they
got more uh civilized and uh give them lethal injection so we definitely do have uh capital punishment
yeah
[noise] there was one here recently that comes to mind that's about a woman that uh this is ridiculous i mean it's almost uh
it'd be funny if it wasn't so so sad i mean this woman this woman went out and hired somebody to uh
to uh kill another mother
yeah right have you heard about that one
yeah isn't that something
i didn't know it made the
national news
[laughter]
that was something wasn't it uh it's unbelievable this
well that brings up i guess part of what would be a question is uh you know is i guess you feel like that's a deterrent in uh capital punishment should be
well it uh [vocalized-noise] must be i think it's a matter of degree and uh of course uh course it varies from case to case or individual
yeah
yeah
huh
[laughter]
that's one thing down here we certainly have a problem with overcrowded prisons
um
yeah
well they're releasing them uh early here
and
and then uh then you hear about ones that are on early release going out and
committing a
um
well i tell you what i think that uh you know this may this may be a cause rather the actual topic but uh i think that a lot of this is caused by
the steady diet of violence they seem to
want to be uh
you know showing on movies and television
um-hum
that's true
well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children
well yeah well i don't know if that's
going to be necessarily workable but it would be uh one way
it certainly has to start with the children
yes i do i think it's uh something that unfortunately uh at this stage of the game i would hope that at some point we would become
you know civilized enough where we could do away with it but as of right now and the way things are i think it's uh something we just have to have
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
huh well i just uh
[laughter]
well i think it comes back to uh starting with the children once you get them you know if you get them
where they have a sense of values and uh you know that uh that's what it takes
that people start uh oh you know repeat about it you know they start to see this violence in a steady diet and uh it's to be uh just
uh
all right
can't remember that
yeah
that's a tough one too
yeah
we had a personal experience with something like that it wasn't didn't go as far as murder but this
this girl young girl had uh she had gotten hold of a gun and she came around to the office where my wife worked and she was she had this mental problem with uh with a doctor she works for him and uh he was she was just
after him you know and the cops pick her up
and uh there wasn't a thing they could do you know they'd take her down to the juvenile hall and then they'd have to let her go and she'd be back [laughter] doing it
okay i'm a meat and potato man [laughter] yeah
i love to cook outdoors
barbecue steaks and fry fish
but uh no exotic foods although i did order a uh
a uh wok that i saw advertised on TV and i'm looking forward to getting that and cooking some Chinese food
[noise] pardon me [noise]
but uh
yeah
yeah
yeah [laughter]
i like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce
yeah i'll take some of the uh thick and rich barbecue sauce and put a little red wine in it a little uh uh liquid smoke
a little soy sauce
and uh some uh seasoned salt mix all that up together and put it on the steak
tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor
but uh grill i have i- i don't normally put hickory chips in it but it's got the uh uh rocks
in the bottom of it and a lot of times the the juice from prior steaks will give it a a good flavor
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah i can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make
yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving
uh i- i can make a meal just out of the the uh uh corn bread dressing and goblet gravy
and uh cranberry sauce i- i could eat just that and be satisfied
yeah
oh yeah
peas and corn and green beans
but
got to have the cranberry sauce
yeah
so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are str- are strange to you
most people never from north when we mention having black eye peas and corn bread and green onions
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
different terminology
i don't care much for those subs there's too much bread for me i don't like that much bread
yeah
yeah
but uh Thanksgiving i- i don't really care that much for turkey
it's too dry for me
[noise] i'll eat the dark meat but you can have the white meat
that's like eating sandpaper
yeah well also New New Year's down here you've got to have black eyed peas
they're supposed to bring you good luck or good or good finances
i'll eat it as long as i'm not around while it's being cooked
yeah
yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving
well plus ham [vocalized-noise] if you're going to give a a party or something ham's always good for one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands you don't have to have a plate
but you can just snack on it
i work at the Lewisville site
uh-huh
[laughter] i i've heard people that uh have come and visited that plant that uh from other plants that our cafeteria is head and shoulders above the others
yeah that's what i've heard
but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one p- particular place and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn't seem like it's
as good as as people say it is
yeah
i think so too
and i- i uh at Lewisville i'm not fond of their vegetable selection
uh
they have as far as i'm concerned because i'm i'm not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow vegetables on the same day and
and it s- seems like it's it's a variety of the same type of vegetable
like they'll have uh
they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day
and that that doesn't
i'm i like more of a variety than that
in fact one day they they had they had three kinds of potatoes
they had mashed potatoes they had French fries and they had au gratin
that's overdoing it
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah and every once in a while they'll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the sage
[vocalized-noise]
got to to strong of a sage taste to it
but uh
i usually i can usually find something to eat there even if it's a hamburger
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah they have muffins there at the TI cafeteria too in the mornings
[vocalized-noise]
yeah they got uh blueberry and
i guess it's apple or some kind of a
maybe cinnamon cinnamon apple it's it's got the cinnamon on top of it
and uh they're pretty good sized too
but i usually wind up getting a donut [laughter]
a chocolate donut
[vocalized-noise]
yeah like i really need the cholesterol
um yep
but i love to cook
i wish i was a better cook than i was but i- i love to cook
i don't like them cleaning up the dishes [laughter]
[laughter] yeah
yeah
you are huh
you barbecue steaks
oh okay
i think my standard thing when i have company and i'm not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out
and sometimes we do like surf and turf like we'll get some little filets wrap them up with bacon and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at the same time so that's my husband's deal he's out there you know [laughter]
[laughter] with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor
and then you do your mashed potato and your salad you can't go wrong with that that'll push please pretty much any guest
oh you do
uh-huh
ooh
um-hum
um okay
uh-huh
oh okay
my only other standard menu i guess is uh Thanksgiving [laughter] i know how to put the bird in cook the bird and make all the trimmings
yeah
well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it
yeah
oh okay
yeah my uh mother-in-law is into the corn bread stuffing now i never really had that much
before i came to Texas but she is always she makes her corn bread and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we didn't do that so much uh i'm from kind of like Ohio area
and uh we're you know not into the corn bread as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that
inside the turkey and then of course we always had to have mashed potatoes
and your standard vegetables like you always had to have some peas and corn [laughter]
and you got to have your cranberry sauce now i like the jellied kind
and you got to have your pumpkin pie
well yeah
[laughter] yeah and it's funny because people call things differently in different areas um
my parents grew up a lot in the Philadelphia area i was very young when we lived there but you call things differently like um uh we called them all hoagies down here they call them submarine sandmiches
and we didn't ever call it uh Cokes and such you know we call it soda
um so it's just different terminology for the same thing
yeah that's it's it's a different kind of bread and it's somewhat of a harder crust it's not the soft
you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak
the the hoagie steak that they they sell
um
[laughter]
[laughter] well what is it for um New Year's lot of people make ham and sauerkraut
[laughter]
uh i think they cook cabbage up north i think that's one of the things they want i'm not sure i'm not
[laughter] now we always had a ham like on uh uh Easter
you always have to have a ham or something on Easter
i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving [noise] just in case people you know have a variety
yeah
oh that's true well um you work here at the Expressway site
oh Lewisville [laughter] any decent food in your cafeteria up there
really
oh
um-hum
hum
well i normally work in the north building and um you would think that since you know the executives are there that we would have a pretty good one but
i don't know i think it's just kind of standard [laughter] like we've got anything while they do cater to the executive dining room but i think they give them different food [laughter]
oh
um
um
[laughter]
[laughter] now that is a little overdoing it
[laughter] well my husband he used to complain at the cafeteria because it seemed like so many of their different items
they always added garlic to it like he would get tuna salad this is what is that and the first ingredient no matter what you're making garlic [laughter]
and he said tuna salad shouldn't taste garlicky [laughter] but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it
um
um
well i'm i spend a lot of time over in Park Central
but we have just a little deli downstairs but in the mornings they make these really good muffins
they don't make a lot of them and i don't think they make them at other places this little deli is like RC Cooper it's a little place you know it's a little chain here in town it's real small
but uh they make the best muffins we're talking it's a real good size one you know [noise] and they make them different flavors like
[noise] oh they have a chocolate chip one poppy seed is my favorite [noise] and uh they'll have like a banana nut and a apple one and a zucchini and a blueberry
really good they usually pretty much go fast they don't make a lot of them You have to get here early in the morning
pretty good
um-hum
hum
[laughter]
[noise] well you ought to try a muffin if you haven't
[laughter]
oh well we all indulge right
well
[laughter] yeah i know my husband he'll cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards
because he has to get everything out and he loves to season i mean he's like he gets every seasoning out of the cupboard you know and uses it and he likes to put lemon
so what kind of eating out do you like
yeah i i like seafood or Chinese or especially Mongolian we've got a real nice little Mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week it's not bad you know
you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the the two mea- the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal
naturally [noise]
yeah
no
oh yeah
do yo- do
yeah do you have a S- do you have a Steak and Ale there
um
i haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good
yeah
yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks
uh-huh
and now that i'm full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies [laughter] consequently that's why you go out to Mongolian all the time
yeah i haven't found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i'm at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my i'm partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i've had out so
and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way
and places place
uh basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill
and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that
all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh
or Thais and they can't speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that it's okay the food is really good
i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again
course a yeah yeah i mean it's it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food
uh-huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody's rude to me or
[noise]
excuse me somebody's rude or something like that i won't go back i don't care how good the food was
but generally i i the places i've been where i've had trouble with the help generally the food hasn't been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem
uh
well gosh now what [laughter] i guess it's been about five minutes
i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh
see my my ex-college buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down there to eat
but we've got a uh family there's a family restaurant here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's
um it's a it's a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or
uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they've just got tons of stuff and it's really cheap one person for about it's about six bucks and it's all you can eat
and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh
deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don't they don't bother you
so it's a pretty good place i bet you don't have those over there
we have uh
there's two of them in Charlotte and we've been to both of them and they're both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i've been in a lot of Ryan's in Alabama and Georgia
and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible
[noise]
and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte
yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh it's it's a pretty neat chain because they they don't take out loans for anything they
when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they're making money immediately it's it's a smart operation
[laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah um
[noise]
i would
yeah exactly and and you and you cook it yourself
gosh that's half the fun cooking it yourself
well that's that's an interesting sounding place
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try
that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that
yeah [laughter]
huh
that's a unique idea i gue- i guess that's part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea
yeah
he he surely doesn't have to worry about supply
that's a pretty good idea
huh
maybe i'll start a restaurant now
[laughter]
i don't know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though
probably burn the place down
well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here
we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but [laughter] gosh
oh well
well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesn't it
[laughter]
some of the subjects i tell you [laughter]
yeah right
it was good talking to you Jackie you have a good night um bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh preferably Mexican food or seafood
oh really hum
wow
yeah
yeah
oh yeah we uh
we haven't found a who- you know the are the best Mexican food we've found is back in Houston
and uh same goes for the seafood of course to there's not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere
but uh you know i think our luxury here is Red Lobster and uh but back home there's you know different places [vocalized-noise] family owned seafood restaurants
uh not close about an hour away in Waco there's the closest one
yeah uh it's been a while since i've been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there
instead of the seafood
yeah yeah
yeah [laughter]
oh
so no i i pretty
you know
Mexican food or or seafood pretty much
i could probably live on that
oh
there you go
yeah
yeah right right well what do you like about your your Chinese food place there that makes you keep going back
uh-huh
oh
oh
yeah
right
yeah uh
right
yeah um
there's there's a couple places around here that we'll go back to now and again um
[noise]
one being a
a Chinese food place and and another one being another Mexican food place and
and
it it just seems that
if the if the help is is good and they're like they're supposed to be that you know you're you're tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason
yeah
yeah
yeah
now what [laughter]
let's see how long do you eat do you go out once a week
yeah
hum
uh-huh
wow
yeah right so you can't complain about that really
i don't think so i haven't heard of it
oh no
oh
[laughter]
made you reconsider hm
oh
hum
right well that's a good way to go about it
yeah there's there's kind of a a little place set up like that i know that they've got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in uh Houston it's called You Are Cook
and that's exactly what you are and it a it turned out it's a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so it's an ongoing circle
you know and you uh you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these
three huge grills
that they have set up for the people to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat
that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is and they're just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the small- the smallest they have is
uh i think a nine ounce filet i mean just we're ta- taking doggy bags home every time we go and it's it's it's like twelve dollars a person but you are you're getting three or four meals out of it by the time you take it home
yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or or they'll cook it they'll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you
yeah it's really a lot of fun because they get up there and
yeah season it and throw it on the grill and
and you know sit around and and just talk while it's cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to
take their own steak back to their table but uh it's really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i don't want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but it's really a it's really a neat phenomena how it all works out
yeah yeah if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try because it's really good food
yeah i'm not sure where all you know he's Texas bound obviously because i haven't heard him go any farther than those three cities but that it's it's really neat too so
yeah
yeah yeah and it's it's and i and you know the fact that it's his own cattle it's just an ongoing
right right
so
yeah yeah you got all these tips [laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah i bet you can't get find Mexican food over there i had always wondered what i'd do if i lived somewhere other than Texas
oh well
hum
i guess so
[laughter]
yeah well they've they've been a lot worse [laughter]
you too Dave you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh do you
uh-huh
yeah
it's been around for a long time hadn't it
yeah who's the coach's name
yeah that sounds familiar
yeah
and with pro ball you mean
who will the opponents
[laughter]
well why that doesn't make sense does it
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well to me i'd want to quit
[laughter]
oh that just shows how much he gets paid anyway
huh
really
where are y'all living now
Denison
yeah do you ever watch the Mavericks
yeah
hm
yeah like who
uh-huh
yeah
yeah he's good too
[laughter]
i used to watch basketball in fact of of the pro sports i guess it's my favorite it's just that i haven't watched many sports this year or in the past several years
how come
the uh academic requirements uh-huh
huh
[laughter]
four out of five hurts
four out of five hurt
huh
yeah well no wonder they're out of it
i said no wonder they're out of it
yes [noise]
uh-huh
so they'll be back
uh-huh
well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic
uh-huh
well i didn't realize it could vary from state to state or univers-
huh
how does that coach feel about that
uh-huh
hm
him
[laughter]
on national TV
yeah it's all politics
yeah
um-hum
huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
oh for heaven's sake what a cheapskate
yeah
oh
his elementary school wife
oh really
well she might have been the cause of it [laughter]
yeah
yeah
uh
yeah
yeah i can imagine especially the kids that were buying them
yeah
huh
well that almighty dollar
um-hum
yeah it is
well i think we met our time limit
so
uh-huh thank you very much
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh mostly we watch college basketball
yeah and uh you know we're from uh originally from Louisville Kentucky and they've got a fairly decent ball club down there
uh as long as i can remember
Denny Crum
yeah Denny Crum's pretty good
he uh
i don't know he's got a million dollar contract when he quits
uh no with uh uh when he quits they'll give him a million dollars
Denny C- uh uh Louisville University
the university gives him a million dollars when he quits
be-
because he's good
and it's giving him an incentitive to stay around and
uh he's been there for so- twenty something years
and uh
i really don't know the uh full reason why they're doing it but they've got confidence in the man
oh he gets too much he ge- you know he
yeah
he's got a TV show down there and everything
in Denison
Texas
sometimes
not a lot uh i- i don't really care for pro basketball i like college basketball and pro football
but i do watch some uh pro foot- basketball mostly it's uh
i watch certain players
oh Magic Johnson uh
Larry Bird
uh
Michael Jordan
and i can name a few more i just can't think of their names right off hand
uh
yeah well the uh NC double A tournament's going on right now
and uh
i haven't watched it this year because Louisville's out of it this year
oh they just uh
they had three
tall guys who had uh didn't meet the requirements you know uh
[noise]
y- yeah academically they didn't meet the requirements so they couldn't play this year so four of them they had four people
my husband's sitting here putting four fingers in my face [laughter] four uh
but they weren't very good but they was uh
huh
yeah well [vocalized-noise]
i think they got
i think that was almost everyone of them that he recruited uh recruited for this year
he didn't and none of them got to play
uh sorry
yeah well they put up a good show they did pretty good for uh
you know having all short people and uh we only had
one we only had one senior on the team
so next year they'll be back and back with a vengeance
in some states yeah because it's reasonable now uh you know m- with me being from Louisville i'm going to say at Louisville is unfair because Louisville's got the highest uh
uh
the line the li- the line drawn i don't know the correct word for it [vocalized-noise] but Louisville's is higher than most other universities and
yeah
yeah they they vary from university not just state to state university
if they'd been anywhere else i don't you know i don't care where it was anywhere in the United States they could have played but beings they was in Louisville they couldn't play
oh he's highly upset he uh went on uh
he was on uh Twenty Twenty or Sixty Minutes i can't remember which one and got blasted uh you know they uh that's where it all came about because he said a few remarks of uh on that uh talk show or
news show and then they uh next thing you know we- they're in violation if they don't uh if they s- if they keep playing they're in violation
so but uh Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much
on national TV he messed up but uh
probably that's probably what it mostly is i- i can't s- say that for sure but you know uh right now though Kentucky's just now getting off of a uh their
suspension from playing on uh TV and then games
next year they'll be uh playing and i know Memphis State was even in a few of them where they go- uh couldn't play
in uh games and stuff because of uh
uh Dana Kirk that was their coach down there uh or over there
uh he
he was uh we was living in Memphis for a while that's why i know about Memphis State
uh he was
selling soda machines at the uh sell- like Coca-Cola had given him
uh for this little
uh this little uh
kid's a a basketball camp that's what it is these little kids would come here and uh Coca-Cola
had sponsored the uh sodas you know just give them to him told him to give them to the boys well he sold them for something like fifty seventy five cents to these boys when he's supposed to given them to them
and uh
yeah he was a he's uh we call him Dana Jerk
yeah and he blames all of his uh tax problems on his elementary school wife
[vocalized-noise] yeah
yeah she she never even got out of elementary school
um
well no he was just a jerk he put uh he put the blame on everyone but himself he went out and you know bought uh bought recruits
n- i'm sure you know that's one thing you don't do
he went out and did that and he got caught and then he got caught with the taxes and then he got caught with the sodas and that soda really went over on the people in Memphis they really got hot about that
yeah these were young kids too they couldn't have been out of middle school
yeah well that's uh yeah i'll agree there
more powerful than you think
yeah i thi- guess we did too all right well well you have a good day
bye-bye
[noise]
i've kind of gotten out of the habit of doing this it's sort of been down this weekend
in the school systems that's right
what school system does he go to
okay
okay my children go to Garland and i teach in Dallas
[laughter]
and my husband teaches with Plano
in the what
well yeah yeah yeah
no no they're still in elementary
so yeah
uh-huh
i'm definitely not are you kidding
[laughter] no
no i want that
[laughter]
i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children because we would do away with so much of the burn out that we have
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school
then it's like they've lost so much ground we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up reteaching what they had the year before
you know
well we're starting pilot schools
it's a Dallas is doing it i know i think Plano don't they have some and Richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools going to school year around
and then we you know we investigated this by flying some people out from Dallas to observe some of the schools in California that already had it
yeah it seems to and one thing it'll save us money because we've got the buildings sitting there right and we might as well use them
well air conditioning what's and and heating
isn't air conditioning less than heating because we have to just up like if we get in the thirties we raise it up to the seventies right that's forty degrees
isn't it less
and it's not going to be like the kids are going to go a lot longer really if you go year around
there's not thirty days difference
there's different ways to do it
like i i think going two six weeks and then having two two weeks off
each after a two w- six weeks period is one way
see i don't know because i've never seen it in action
well no the school system in Dallas has sent people there to do that no
but i think i'd like it and i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it
the principal's their t- hands are tied by all the administrators and i heard
that in Dallas it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired
[laughter]
and that's just it's just you don't even know who all your bosses are it's ridiculous
Marvin Edwards
well you know he did [noise] supposedly cut administrators but what they've done is create other offices for those same people
and just rehi- renamed their jobs
and you know opened up -nother -nother things one thing we've got going is called reading and initiative and they've hired all these administrators in on that you know
pass or no fail uh what is it
no play
no play
Carter High School yeah
and all the things that Dallas fights costs thousands probably millions of dollars i bet you
yeah i know
and psychologists [laughter] and stuff that's right
no we do not
no [laughter]
we need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students because i- it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper and you're trying to ration it
you know now that's sad when there's supposed to be what [vocalized-noise] you know one thousand what sixty five dollars something like that spent on each pupil
um [noise] it's it's wrong anyway i was thinking about [noise]
one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities and i think in nineteen uh ninety three we're supposed to begin that if if a child is a visual learner we're supposed to present him with all these visual things and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic
we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it learns the best way and that's going to be quite a problem
but if we could do something like that i'm sure it would certainly help
[laughter] i don't know no telling i don't know
and you know at non graded schools they've had one in Gladewater for years and years and years if we could just let these kids go at their own rate
i have children even i i teach Chapter one and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to like ITBS scores
and some of the kids really they shouldn't be in there and they're you know they're not being challenged and they're not being challenged in their home and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road
um-hum
right
my children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time to do anything with them
[laughter]
yeah
i know it i know it [laughter]
i went for a couple and i didn't know that there there was even a cut off or anything
oh another things that's wrong with schools this is big [laughter]
there's too much emphasis on test
we're spending the first hour of everyday teaching for the [vocalized-noise] test at my school and we're going to do that until at least the first part of May
[laughter]
but see they're not in Dallas
it's
yeah we're not working with the same type of students that most of these kids in Garland are
but see what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are and we're not teaching toward the test we're teaching
you know always objectives you know it's like there's not a whole lot of you know fun time like we used to have in school
like our principal says i want every child to be on task all the time
and you can't do that as adults
but we're expecting kids to
and like after after recess play
we don't get that okay if they finish before their thirty minutes is up then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes probably be the most
but we always got that didn't you
yeah
yeah
[noise]
yes that w-
well i haven't tried but this is i haven't called in a couple of days but
education in public schools i have a son who's graduating uh in May
and there's some interesting problems of of of how do you how do you challenge the kids today and
i have some real hang-ups i think that uh if your
if your kid's not ambitious he can sure get lost
yes
in North Garland he goes t-
what school system are you familiar with
oh oh okay well i have a daughter that's in the in
in the IB program at Garland
in the a- are you familiar with the International baccalaureate program
uh do your kids go to Garland High you say
oh okay
well there's a it's um she went from Austin Academy when it opened up
over to uh to North Garland for ninth grade but at North Garland the the difficulty i see with the education system is that uh is that you can you can you can get some masses
but u- unle- if the kid's really dedicated it seems like they do all right but if
if if your child is just pressing along uh i i'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough would you argue with that
well you know the the the thing that i don't see and i i maybe you would take issue with it is that if if we went to if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around
well would
well how do we acco- how do we get that
yeah
does it work well out there
well what about the what about the issue of air conditioning
isn't that a a [noise] a area of concern in the cost of air conditioning
oh yeah i
yeah
yeah it's it's less degree days you're right but i think i think clearly
yeah
well how do they do it do they put uh long do they put two or three week breaks
between
is that from from what you've seen is that the desirable way to do it
oh you said you had some people from California oh i thought you
oh okay but you didn't go
well the the other issue has to do that i hear that the local commentator i listen to David Golsome some the idea that the numbers of administrations and the fact that the principal
do you see that the principals aren't really in charge
well i had heard that one of the comments when they when they brought it
hum
the one of the the one they brought in the new uh superintendent for Dallas schools the adminis- um
can't think of his name but the idea that yeah that he had suggested that that maybe they could reduce the number of administrators and
and some of the people who were administrators saying that that uh that that's not what he was hired for
but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there
hum
well the you know the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money that it co- that it took to contest the the football um issue
yeah but the i can't think of the name of the school that
that uh but in any event they they they kept arguing that
yeah and they went to court i mean
uh you know i guess i'm i'm sympathetic with the kids but but how much money did that cost Dallas to to to to fight that in court
but just think of all the them all the lawyers you've kept employed see
that's ri-
that's right and and all these other people and out running around i i guess that's the only problem with jobs is being relatively scarce so
but you need to keep all these people employed right
and and
[laughter]
you mean you mean we need a little more of our tax money like maybe uh
yeah
well
oh that's
hum that's interesting and how many administrators is that going to take
yeah
yeah
well that's that's part of where my son is um would like to go to Rice but i don't think he's
well the the difficulty is is is the people that get in are are are overachievers
and he's not an overachiever but the same time everybody can't go but the question of of you know of of how far should you take a kid in the motivation i'm not sure
i think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids i had a a friend that was administrator in Richardson and said if the parents read books
then the kids probably would read books
but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to question of of how much reading do those kids' parents do
well
well but that's the point as i would say uh and that's that's what makes there's a lot of problems but
anyway um
i'm trying to think how much longer i had a conversation week or so ago and we got carried away and they cut it beeps in at ten minutes so
[laughter] so anyway
yeah
hm
well see that's the thing in the Garland schools the numbers they i don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes
well opportunity right
see if you get graded on percent improvement
but see that-
yeah
and unfortunately the uh that's
that's tough that's a real challenge though but uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well yeah you know our s- son had that he wa- has had uh attention deficit disorder and they were keeping him from recess and in reality that's uh
that's one of those really tough situations i think the kids need some time to play
but
nevertheless goo- if if people like if more people like you though that understand the problem get in and
maybe we can change some education so
uh i got some background noise there but i guess
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh yeah because they're just sort of coming from the side or whatever yeah
uh-huh
yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the po- the the aspect of invasion of privacy there's a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in
whatever they are i- i do i find an- and they go alone with that just the things you get in the mail
i you know my my name being sold if i if i give money to the World Wil- Wildlife Federation you know it's a it's a i feel it's an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk mail because they sell my address
uh-huh yeah
that's i agree yeah and it
i'll call you that's right and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've so far [noise] picked out to be the best you know because of a low interest rate or whatever
you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate they're always more expensive and they uh you know if you stay with a if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um a good credit line so you don't like to i don't like to bother with it yeah
um
uh-huh
yeah huh
um-hum that's right
yeah that's right
[noise]
it takes uh
uh-huh
yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they yep and you know they and they just keep talking to you too i- i i find that a big pain yeah i think
uh-huh
yeah
i think uh do you find that as a woman that you probably see more things of invasions of privacy than uh a man would
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
[noise]
huh
uh-huh [noise]
[noise] yeah
yeah wh- you know what's really funny is that um i get calls you know mostly telephone sales people that i just you know that want to start beating my ear you know
and um and then they start asking you know well is your wife there and then i'm thinking well how did they know i was married you know and then i'll say i'll say no she's not because actually my wife and i live apart right now because i'm in graduate school and um
so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and it's one of those things where they'll say oh your wife's not there and i'll say i'll say no oh well when is she going to be there and i'm like well she's never going to be here yes she's never going to be here so you know
oh yeah uh-huh and and they'll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it's i-
yeah maybe she would talk me in yeah maybe they'll
[noise]
yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah they they do what do you think i just just threw out stuff tonight that uh i walked out of a grocery store and a fellow said you know for a dollar you can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries
and normally when you see these things it's normally um
uh a church you know that's doing a raffle or it's some type of boy scouts or it's some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh it's a raffle must be for the kids
you know so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and
and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that it's for some sales pitch of some kind where they're going to
you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just i'm from then on in it's like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what they're doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization
and you sure you're with multiple dys- you know muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too
because they they sort of pull that over on you you know like um like this is a charitable organization but actually it's not it's a come on so that they can get your name and phone number
so because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell you that you won
but actually they started calling me telling me that i could you know buy a soft water softener and they called me for um what else other than water softener the same place called me for
something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i think also you know in th- the if men are home during the day they're they're um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um
you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i
looking for something yeah they're searching for something yeah and also and also you know the woman at home during the day if if the housewife is at home um
uh you know she may be bored at the time so she'll spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
um-hum
he said what
[noise]
that's an invasion of privacy
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh that's true that's true [noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh
what you know the the terrible thing is i don't know if you've watched the news lately i- i guess we just had something up here you're i'm in Baltimore Maryland
so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um they don't have enough stalls in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms
so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster
but but the women have to wait in long lines that are uncomfortable and and if they really have to go it's a very difficult problem to be you have to stand in line for an hour and uh and then the whole
[noise]
i think i was one okay um first thing i thought of was
was just the men that put the flyers on the door and i'm a Christian and i think i feel sorry for people that have to do that you know what i mean i always pray for the guys but when i'm sitting on my couch and it's and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob
it's kind of frightening like whoa and i've i've kind of gotten used to it but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming up
from the side because you can't see them approaching your house you know they just
exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh
like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or
you know so i think there's other ways to advertise other than a flyer on your door
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right i do too even the credit card things and like we have a Visa and we've got we get ten applications probably a month
for other Visas and it's like wait a minute we have a commitment with the company we're with if i want a Visa from your company i'll call you yeah
yeah
yeah
right
it shows stability but um now i also thought uh i i get calls i'm a housewife so i'm home a lot in the day
and i i get probably four calls probably four a day probably three day a norm but seems like
[vocalized-noise] it seems like it's more than that of phone calls and and it i've gotten to where i've really had to say okay wait a minute this you know it's okay to be nice and sometimes
you know i feel like God says talk to this person or something but most of the time i just have gotten where i can say i'm not interested thank you and i just hang you know and i hang up real nicely but
um i know a few months ago
i i would feel that i had to explain to them that i'm on the other line or i'm in the middle and it's i've just come to a realization that
i don't have to explain to this stranger what i'm doing it and give excuses that's it's okay just to say i'm not interested and go ahead and hang up but i- i don't know i don't think most people are secure enough to probably answer
like that and therefore i feel it's an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what they're doing even though it's none of the business
and i did it for a long time and and i just i feel like that was one i thought of that right off
yeah right they don't want to let you go they don't believe you if you're on another line long distance and they just want to keep going and going and stuff so
um yeah i probably do i feel like i don't know i'm a Christian i feel like women are more usually deceived yo- i feel like i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing
because God gave us husbands and fathers to help look out for us but i know that during the day
the when the cults come by they come by during the day and it says in the Bible that
be weary of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly women lay captive with gossip and stuff and i see that they don't come home when my husband's here they don't come to my house
normally when my husband's here they come when i'm here alone and i notice that and it's almost like
there's a a subconscious understanding i think it's spiritual that you can rationally explain the subconscious understanding that you know there's there's a more gullibility here when there's not a
a man present i don't think i'm less than a man because of that
i but i see that and God's really shown me that and i don't talk to them i don't try and witness to them don't try and convert them i just say you can you can ei- you can come back when my husband's here
if you'd like to but we're Christians good-bye and i shut the door and that's it and i'm not ugly to them you know what i mean
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
[laughter]
right
yeah
are you kidding
oh man they do that really
see i
she can talk you into that most a lot of women
a lot of women most women control the budgets and they control the money and they control the husband [laughter] i mean most of the time that's how it works and so therefore i guess that they their they see that um
so they feel like i can talk her into [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
yeah
oh great
that's funny uh-huh
oh they're i know it's funny how you can look back as a Christian you can see how these things apply and they're true and in even even in people that aren't even Christians it's like they [vocalized-noise] there's just a pattern
that you can see in things like that i've noticed that about the cults that they work our neighborhood in the day and they work them good and i consider that i kind of consider that an invasion of privacy but not so much as i do the other
you know what i mean because but i do in to a degree there's also not a day to day occurrence it's not that often that they come by but i've notice it's kind of gone down before when we first moved here it was
pretty often but i've noticed that though that they really work in the day and you very rarely see them in the evening because the men are home and so
right
right
looking for something yeah kind of depressed or something
yeah i didn't think of that but yeah that's good
uh-huh
yeah
right
and there's nobod- but there's no husband there to come in and say wait a minute
you know i really think this is good and that well i don't know i think we need that but i know i need it
but um the only thing i would have thought of is my husband just said this he said public bathrooms he [vocalized-noise]
public bathroom [laughter] well he was teasing but he was just being smart because because you know you don't want to go in the public you know [laughter]
what can we do to solve that we can make the architects for all the buildings make private stalls for everyone i thought that was funny but
uh-huh
that's funny
yeah i did hear that on the news
[laughter]
well uh
i don't have any strong convictions about it that's for sure um
i know i haven't done any Peace Corps service and
i don't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it do you know uh do you know anybody that's been it
yeah
yeah it's definitely up to the person uh so
i'd have to say that uh
it you know the people who do it
well some feel it's rewarding i don't know you know
but uh
i don't know how we got the subject you know i have nothing to say about this
um-hum well how long you been in San Antonio
okay
okay
and uh you you were just up there then huh
uh
oh okay
well that's good
well it sounded like i mean this is like maj- long term commitment like a year or six months or
so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don't know i mean but uh
um-hum
but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to
yeah yeah they couldn't cover my hourly rate
[laughter]
i couldn't afford it
but uh
yeah Africa
yeah well i doubt that but you know i guess
well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know
the culture usually i guess i think that maybe that's why some people do it is
uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that but
uh to do that i don't know i'd have to be
i don't know
oh
um-hum well you know uh i know American Expre- i'm no- i'm working at American Express now and they
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off
like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that
and
they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off
so it is something that i think
uh
you know even the larger organizations will support uh
it's r- it's really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing
i don't know
pre- it's for yeah i think at the same time it's for some people to
you know help them grow in other areas
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah m-
yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh
i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean i- you know when they're in the college
sometimes it's to su- help support college you know the money
uh others people don't know what they want to do
but as far as uh
you know the Peace Corps
i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives
but i think a lot of it's you know when the people get older they'll do something like that
yeah i- i i don't
didn't mean to cut you off there
uh
i know
or tr- or [noise] try to make a living
but uh yeah i i have no
i don't know anybody that's that done that either so
i it's it's interesting we got this topic because i i i don't know what i marked off to get this but
so you had the same one huh
oh well well you you'll get it over with here [laughter]
how many times have you talked
yeah
oh i've done maybe four or five
well she just sent me the information out i
i got a hold of it you know i just sent it back in and
what other topics have you had
great great
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
hm
yeah i always
i use everything with my Visa and i pay it all off so that's a good deal for me i get free money for thirty days so
that's the way i use them uh i tr- i try to make sure i don't get in debt so
i had uh let's see i've had fishing
and uh
i can't remember
me and
i think me and Dana had football yeah we did
yeah uh we so we talked about the Cowboys a little bit and
i'm out here in Phoenix so we talked about Phoe- Cardinals and
so so that one was all right and then what else i had
i think i had some other uh
like staying in shape or working out this other guy i got this guy from New York so
and you've probably never gardened in your life [laughter]
yeah i don't i don't have too much of a green thumb either so
i do have one plant here it's been hanging out for a while but i think it's one of your easiest plants i can't i don't know the name of it but
i'm not too much into
[noise]
well how do you feel about it
no the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries
and that's only because i went to Baylor and a lot of students from Baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer
but i think i think that's a terrible idea that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity
i mean it it's nice to to try to teach young people some
some uh
uh
civil uh consciousness
but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts
it it
i don't either
i don't either i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i don't i don't really have an opinion except for no i think that's dumb
but uh
i've been here for um just uh almost five y- well no almost four years
and i lived with Dana in school
that's how we know each other
uh-huh last weekend we went to Six Flags Saturday
yeah a good old time
well back to the topic at hand [laughter]
what other types of community service would they be talking about i mean [vocalized-noise] the the recording mentioned the Peace Corps
yeah
i mean i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes like i do some
volunteer work here and there and every once in a while i'll do uh a uh local Big Brother Big Sister thing
or i'll go you know do a
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah i i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life
to to go do something
[laughter]
no kidding
i have this thing against bugs too and seems to me like the Peace Corps they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs
a lot of
yeah [laughter]
have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
oh i don't know either the o- growing up all i knew was
you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to ex- to broaden your horizons
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
i'm for
kind of like joining the military
well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up
and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time
um-hum
i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps
but i don't and none of my
oh that's okay n- and none of my
really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything so i don't really know anyone first hand that's
that's comm- committed a chunk of their life to do service work
everybody i know has been well i'm going to go get a j- good job and make some money and buy a nice car
so
yeah
i certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one
i c- i can't imagine and the switchboard's been down for several days and the last time i called it before it went down
i had this topic and i didn't feel like talking about it so i hung up and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it
yeah
i know it [laughter]
oh probably five or six
not a whole lot
yeah did Dana sign you up for this
yeah that's she stuck my name on some list so they mailed me the information
that i filled out
well that's pr-
um i've talked about camping with someone i've talked about the weather
that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in Washington DC
and it was hot here and it was snowing there so that was pretty interesting
and i talked to someone about the uh
the uh education system
i forget exactly what the focus was on that one but that was fairly interesting
and i've talked to somebody about credit card usage
and and i talked to this person who
i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just didn't have much
and they didn't have much credit available to them
and so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work and
and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you
you can do certain things with them
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well that's always a good plan
i can't think of anything else that i've talked about
all the the m- most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about
and i haven't gotten a one of them yet when i've called
oh how funny
um-hum
i had to talk to someone about hobbies
and
the switchboard called me so i was caught a little off guard and i couldn't think of anything at all
so i started making stuff up [laughter]
i told this woman that my hobby was gardening
and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy my grandfather gave me a plant once that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could
you could dry it out no matter what you couldn't kill it well i killed it pretty quick
[laughter]
[noise]
okay do you um have a garden
um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard
um-hum
uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised
i we had some in Virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the Texas climate better
right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad
where i live do you live in Texas or
Plano oh yeah i'm out in Rowlett and we have that brown clay soil and it's real hard to grow
anything here
uh-huh
oh [laughter] that's accommodating
yeah
right we've got a few things too it's hard to tell if they'll come back or not
well that's good we
we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we're going to something else
but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and
pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year
yeah
yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing
that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front i've enjoyed
doing those i put uh pansies out in the winter and
they pretty much last all winter and then i put uh moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you don't really have to do anything to it
puts a lot of color out there
all year
right
oh yeah
those do pretty well here don't they
we've got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of
make a little cut so that the kids wouldn't come marching through the yard and everything
yeah
right yeah the only thing i don't like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp
pricky things get in your hands
oh really
yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff
yeah we get something on the door about every week
uh-huh
yeah really
oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i don't think it looks any better than what my husband does so
i'm not really tempted to do that either
if
yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the grass in our front yard is so dense
that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it
oh
really
huh
i would like a self-propelled one i think
that might make it easier
yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front i'd be stuck because i can't get it to move [laughter]
oh
oh i'm sure [laughter]
yeah that's a pretty large area
really
did people up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here
yeah
yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into it like they do here in Texas
wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband
tilled it up in the fall and then we've been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of about a dollar
and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesn't look too good so i can't say anything about anybody else's [laughter]
yeah
it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
yeah yeah
yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood
we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so we that's where we keep putting that pecan
keeps dying we have uh i think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that that's hung on out there
right
yeah
hope ours continues to live it's been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe it's e- established enough that it'll go on and survive
i like an oak oak trees yeah
my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little
red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but
so far we haven't had much luck
uh-huh [laughter]
oh
oh
yeah well that's too bad
we've got all of our trees from Calloway's and luckily they'll take them back any time for any reason if they die so
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less
but Calloway's has kept theirs forever so
yeah
yeah i don't know we haven't bought
uh-huh we haven't bought any shr- shrubs yet hopefully
i think we've almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size
yeah
oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer
root stimulator yeah
oh well that's good to know maybe there's still hope for our front yard this summer then
uh-huh
yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great
right yeah
yeah except last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and and was able to save them but this year they look even worse
um-hum
yeah
huh ours haven't done anything yet this year
yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color
in the summer
[laughter] oh we haven't had that problem yet they're pretty ours are pretty small
oh really
yeah
oh
does it grow along a fence or something
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of
yeah i certainly do uh i planted uh a rosebed last year
and uh they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink
uh
yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh lot of uh oh [laughter] some some plant food once a month
yeah i'm in uh Plano
yeah i've got a well my roses are on the west side of the house i asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their uh front door
because it's right by their entryway and they they wanted roses so [laughter] that's what i planted
um-hum
yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the the freeze this winter
i've got quite a few dead shrubs some [vocalized-noise] and oleander
yeah the trees are all doing really well i've got a nice Japanese maple out front that uh
looking really nice right now
uh-huh
yeah
yeah every year uh there's some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of shrubs
have to go replace them with uh something a little hardier
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of ever- evergreen type shrubs some uh
some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies
they do very well um-hum
yeah they make a nice hedge uh
and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to trim them uh into a boxy type hedge
you can just let them uh grow their natural uh shape
oh yeah oh i've got some Chinese Hollies that are just outrageous
they they are very sharp
do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that
yeah i do that myself too i- i too really don't appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me
because i've got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet
it's what they call low maintenance yard and these uh uh maintenance uh companies call up wanting to uh
uh put put the uh weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i- i don't spend that much in a year
uh-huh
it doesn't take much work
huh
uh-huh
yeah i've got a little electric mower and i- i will never buy another one of those again
it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor
um-hum
it's better for for a large yard
yeah
before i moved down here when i was up uh north in Wisconsin living with my folks they lived on uh three and a half acres of land and uh we started mowing that with a push mower
uh they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big improvement for for us [laughter] us kids who had to go out there and uh mow the the grass every every week
it it still took a few hours even with the riding mower
um not nearly as much as here
uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice
yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing
my street uh is
kind of in between there are a couple of uh neighbors who are are really good about planting flowers and trees
but there the majority really haven't done anything with their yards this neighborhood is is four years old
and you would think that uh in that time they'd uh get their lawns and and gardens established
um-hum
yeah i'd like to see the the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started
right
you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
it's nice when the builders plant trees for you when when they build the house
no uh my builder was Gemcraft and they didn't put uh trees in at all
yeah
the trouble with with builders planting the trees is they they get the weaker varieties ones that aren't as desirable
and uh those include Arizona Ash and in some cases silver maples
yeah that's probably true i've got a live oak in front uh i- i really like the oaks a lot
they're very hardy for this area
um-hum
oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from uh
from a guy who sold trees off the back of a trailer [laughter] and that was a mistake for uh well two reasons one thing it wasn't insured
and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree uh right before summer the heat of summer it couldn't uh take the heat and it died
yeah i usually go to Callaway's or Wolfe
Callaway's tends to have nicer shrubs uh more fully developed
and uh i don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their uh warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years
yeah
really well that's good for trees i don't think they do that for shrubs
i think it's still a a year or less for uh for shrubs
oh it's never too late to plant something un- unless well for trees if they're balled and bur lapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall or winter
but for uh just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine
right just have to take care of them and water them uh so they get established put some uh uh some uh
uh
right right some uh stimulator down
so uh yeah it's never a problem to plant things in the summer
i'm just waiting for a sale
they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet
so
but once they uh drop the prices a little bit i'll be out there uh picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where we're [laughter] where my dead shrubs are right now i haven't even pulled them out of the ground yet
you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles
because they'll look really bad like they're dead
and all of a sudden they'll bud out
i've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful
and uh there are buds coming out all over the place now
i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now
have to make sure they don't get out of hand [laughter]
they they can
right they can get out of control
but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet
but i do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house
grows on the on the brick
on the house itself
that you have to really watch uh to uh keep it under control because they will take over a house if you don't uh tend to it
uh those things grow about an inch a day
[noise]
okay
uh-huh i've never seen that before
uh-huh i've heard about it but i've never watched in fact i don't usually watch TV on Monday nights [vocalized-noise] i guess i'm either just really tired from the weekend and i get home well uh
i have aerobics on Monday nights too i just didn't quite make it tonight because i was caught up at work for too long but
but uh yeah i i usually don't get home until eight o'clock so that's another good reason but
yeah i like Cheers
uh-huh
back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasn't doing aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately um i liked The Wonders Year's and uh
um
sometimes every now and then i'll i'll catch Doogie Howser because i think that comes on at eight on Wednesday nights and that's about the time i get home from aerobics and i turn on the TV as i sit down to eat dinner and i'll catch that
uh-huh
um
oh no [laughter]
yeah
yeah it's kind of cute um
yeah
yeah
i like uh what is it on Tues- oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night
yeah i like that one um
i haven't seen it in a while
um-hum
uh-huh
i know i know it's funny that that women even like that show because he really is he's such a jerk but then it's just kind of funny because yo- you can sit there and laugh and go yeah what a guy [laughter] typical [laughter]
but uh that one's kind of cute i'm real bad i got hooked on a soap opera when i was in college General Hospital
everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didn't gather in the TV room at two o'clock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i
i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm
my roommates watched General Hospital and they watched All My Children and some other soaps and i was going i'm not even going to be near that TV when they have any other soap on because i don't want to get stuck in another one one is bad enough no more [laughter] but uh
oops [laughter] how old is she oh [laughter]
sorry mom
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
yeah don't ever start [laughter] that's just the thing
uh-huh
oh gosh
i just couldn't watch that much TV [laughter]
hum
yeah
course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of TV watching time because they're really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything i've ever seen in my life but still i just don't think i could sit down for two hours
and especially two hours of soap operas i'd that'd be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long i'd kind of be like uh
this is enough [laughter] i can't take this any more [laughter] this is disgusting [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah yeah i think so i mean i guess that's the only one i've ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched Dallas or Knots Landing or any of those things because it's like
i don't want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week
i mean you can watch Coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait i'm missing an episode and i won't know what's going on
and so that's fine and i like LA Law too that's another one
it is pretty good i've watched it maybe five or six times just that it comes on kind of late on Thursday nights and sometimes i'm trying to get things done and get in bed so i can go to work of of course for you it probably comes on really late on Thursday night come to think of it
gosh
oh gosh [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i haven't watched Johnny Carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch David Letterman and things like that in college and Love Connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because we'd get up in the in the apartment
and the guys from downstairs who by the way two of them were from San Antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and they'd come upstairs and watch it with us and we'd all sit there and
you know we'd be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but uh
kind of yeah but they have the three choices on video and it's usually real funny because they'll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didn't work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and
half the time they'll say well when he showed up at the door he didn't really look quite like his video and i just wasn't real sometimes they really burn each other it's really kind of funny but
yeah well then if the other person hears something like that they come back just as bad [laughter] and he'll say well she underestimated her weight by quite a bit [laughter] and they they just got you know they they go back and forth and it's kind of funny um
and then you'll see the real funny looking couples and it's it's it was just entertaining and of course that was
that's been probably oh five six seven years ago since
we used to do that but uh i don't know if it even still comes on but that was always fun [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
sometimes i'll turn on CNN or something like that in the morning when i if i- i get really sick of the radio in the morning because they just they're so obnoxious
and so i'll turn on the TV and just i can hear it back in the bathroom and you know keep up kind of what's going on in the world so i'll do either CNN or Good Morning America or something like that but from time to time
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i haven't watched it since the war started i CNN though was it was a life saver for me back in October
TI had sent me to Taiwan actually they sent me to six foreign countries Taiwan was right about in the middle and all they speak there is Chinese and in my hotel room there was nothing but Chinese programs on and they had CNN
and i just kept that thing on constantly because i was going English language this is wonderful and and they at least i kind of knew what was going on on the other side of the world and trying to keep up with
okay what's the weather been like and what's happening back in the US because by then i'd been out of the country for three weeks already and i was i was you know wondering what's been happening lately but
yeah believe it or not
yeah it was in English they had it in Tokyo too in English but they had they had they had Married With Children have you ever seen that before
they had that on in Tokyo i watched it one night i've seen it here before a few times it's a real sarcastic type show it's kind of funny
um i thought i can't believe they're playing that in Japan these people over there must think we are horrible i mean some of the American shows were some of the worst ones we have and that's what they're showing in Tokyo and i'm thinking
they must think Americans are just really terrible [laughter] if they watch this
i mean
yeah
yeah it was pretty embarrassing
she's like Peggy Bundy oh boy [laughter] and he's like Al Bundy [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
uh
[noise]
okay well i guess i can tell you that tonight is Murphy Brown that's the one i don't miss and i don't know if you've seen that that's with Candace Bergen
yeah
really
[noise]
um-hum
oh jeez
uh-huh
i'd say that's the only one i don't miss or i try not to miss that one and Cheers on Thursdays
uh-huh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually [laughter] with any regularity
uh-huh
my daughter watches that religiously we tape it for her because it comes on at nine here and she has to go to bed at eight thirty and uh so that you know we watch it too [laughter] while we're taping it we watch it
yeah i like the lessons it's a good uh good it's got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one
oh that's right Coach yes that's another one that i try not to miss although it use to be better i don't know it seems well
yeah i was going to say i haven't seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with Christine
and i was thinking well do i really want her to go back with such a jerk [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh [laughter] uh-huh yeah
oh really
really
um
uh-huh
[noise]
i know excuse me just a minute i think Katy
get off the phone [noise] [laughter]
ten
[laughter]
so she's been ge- she's been hearing about the the different calls and i've i've been in the middle of tests and stuff so i keep you saying oh press three [laughter]
so let's see i was trying to think of i don't think i've ever watched any soap operas i thi- my mom used to watch Young and the Restless but i don't i don't watch them
no [laughter] well my my last boss's wife
she oh gosh she would run the tape player from the minute she went to go do her aerobics and she used to do like um filing at the hospital
and i think she did some work at a thrift store so as long as she was gone for about four hours well maybe three she would tape soap operas
and uh she would watch them at night when she came home
i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know he'll come home from work and there she'll be watching soap operas yeah
oh really [laughter]
um-hum
right [laughter]
yeah well she's really she's really into it i guess but i never have g- gotten used to well i just really never have been home i think during that time
and so i never had a chance and even when i was in school of course i always had classes about that time so i never had a chance but General Hospital huh is one to get hooked on if you're going to get hooked [laughter]
uh-huh
no
uh-huh
right really
and i've never watched that i going to have to watch that sometime
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and uh i don't think Johnny Carson comes on until like eleven
so everything really that's what's really cut into my TV watching is the time that everything comes on since it's all shifted back an hour i just i don't really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes
i can't stay up past ten thirty i'm falling asleep anyway so i miss most everything anyway
but uh let's see
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
i've never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh
oh God
uh-huh
that is terrible and the other person has to hear it
oh
uh-huh oh gosh
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh gosh i was going to say i never heard of that one The Love Connection
uh-huh [laughter]
[noise] oh yeah i hadn't heard that one let's see i can't oh gosh that that probably wipes out my whole inventory of TV shows other than um PBS i
right now they've got that Katherine Hepburn one where she's touring all the gardens of Europe i of course have missed the first series of that but that's about the only thing that i really catch on PBS
and uh we used to get Arts and Entertainment in San Antonio and i we get a little bit of the good ones here but we used to try and catch uh some of the stuff they had on there
and like i said [laughter] i don't really watch TV too much any more uh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well we used to watch CNN because that was the only thing on really early that i could an update on all the news but with the war coverage i had had it with reporters
and the coverage and so after a while i just turned it off i said i can't take it any more i just can't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
i i never knew that i never even thought that they would have CNN on in Taiwan
i guess that keeps anybody that's traveling that's American over there you'd think that they'd put it on in Chinese or translate it in Chinese
huh
no i've heard about it i've seen a little bit of it it was kind of [laughter]
huh
i know that i didn't much
uh-huh
oh
they probably do you know if that's all they see of us oh God what a thought [laughter] so next time i think of that next time i meet somebody from Japan they're going to think oh Married With Children yeah that's what she's like
oh golly
yeah because i i can't remember where i've seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking who'd think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if i'm going to spend my time but it was
um a lot of um borderline jokes ye-
[noise]
if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have
plowed everything under and had a rice field
it's so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad
it's steady but it's not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then
a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch inch and a half
we're getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time
well that's where the front had came come from they said it came out of the Pacific run across California who was really needing the rain it should've it should've stalled over them for a couple more days
well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits
isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though
yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area
uh they had a
little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it
how do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that [vocalized-noise] i've always lived down in this part of the country and i'm not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet and
a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm water out of the tap and thaw your windshield
just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that
sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here
well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting
torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground
we get maybe
all winter long we might end up with
twenty five days of really cold weather and of those
by the time it [vocalized-noise] gets lunch time
as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable
uh i think of any thirty five and below as cold
another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the Gulf the wind chill factor
blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during the winter that we've got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out
trying to think where's the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably
if you're drawing a line across a map of the country put the middle of your ruler on Dallas
they get snow up there but it's
it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties
you get much above you get much above the Texas border on in that sec- sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma they've got a little bit longer winter
they're catching
all the
cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies straight across Kansas and Nebraska and there's nothing
the only thing that stands between Oklahoma
and Kansas and Nebraska there's a barb wire fence somewhere around Topeka that's the only thing to slow down the wind
[laughter]
[noise]
so uh how's the weather by you
[laughter]
i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad
really that bad huh
is it is it typically this rain- i don't think it's typically this rainy by you down there is it
oh God i guess you're getting all of California's rain
right
oh they're getting another one later in the week there
there was another one that was another storm um that was supposed to hit them like on Wednesday or something
so i suspect it'll it'll wind it's way to you afterward
it's not a pleasant thought
so
[laughter]
well well i can uh i can understand that weather we're having uh
we are it we had a late um um an ice storm here
about two weeks ago which is you know um and and it's and it's they're calling it the worst ice storm in like the last hundred years
and um and then to the point where about three hundred thousand people in our in our area lost power
and
yeah oh yeah this is this is um well yeah up here in in in Rochester winter usually doesn't you know spring comes about this time March or April
and um this was sort of unexpected it had actually been pretty fairly nice you know in the in the forties and um
it had even been in the uh in the in the low fifties a couple of days in a row and then they actually they predicted it they said well we're going to have an ice storm coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be
and it came in and in one night it basically destroyed
it destroyed approximately one third of all the vegetation in um in like the three county area by us
and about half the city owned trees in the city of Rochester are destroyed
um we ha- uh i uh um my wife and i own our own home and we have a very big willow tree in our backyard
that um that ninety percent of which came down in one night
things like that it was a it it definitely is very um
it was it was it wasn't supposed to be as bad they they have i g- i- i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything this bad this late in the season
oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in the morning you know um we didn't we yo- yo- you didn't sleep very well because ev- all all around you there were crashing sounds and
and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at one point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our house and
things like that and then you go outside and everything is covered in ice i mean um you're talking about the lawn before being too mushy to mow
um in our case it was just the opposite i mean the lawn was just a solid sheet of ice each blade of grass had a small individual covering of ice you know um
maybe you know two or three millimeters thick but thick enough that you could actually see it my car was covered completely in ice it was uh in [vocalized-noise] ice of about a half inch thick at one point
well it
yeah um actually it turned out in our case um i know somebody who when they tried to defrost their car cracked their windshield um
[vocalized-noise] so [vocalized-noise] occasionally it can be a big problem in our case we didn't um
we didn't have the problem because my we keep my wife's car in the garage
so her car didn't get iced over you know it wasn't um
um it was a little bit cold in her car in the morning but it wasn't iced over [vocalized-noise] so i just left my car out there for a couple of days and um within two or three days it was it was actually warm enough that everything melted
um it was it was actually one of the most beautiful sights i've ever seen
because everything looks you know if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet of ice and and and it looks really nice the whole whole place but um
it got you know after the initial storm it got worse as things started to melt because um as things melted branches shifted and started to fall again
so we're still cleaning up we actually left the last people got power i guess yesterday
and we left the state of emergency last night or something at like midnight
so it's it's it's not fun
strangely enough the roads weren't that the the roads themselves were okay um there wasn't
given that um sort of things hit and and for some reason i don't i don't quite understand why they i guess m- maybe the ice didn't have anything to grab onto the roads themselves weren't
weren't like covered in a solid sheet of ice things seemed to be okay um especially given that you know the next day it was forty degrees
um you know [vocalized-noise] everything started to melt and then the roads themselves
icewise were okay it was just that um there were there were power lines down everywhere on the road and there were trees downed everywhere and wherever you drove was sort of like driving through an obstacle course you didn't want to
have to wind up hitting um
you know hitting a tree or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or anything else that was the rough part of it they closed school for kids for like a week ju- just because of that
so
yeah that's what i'm actually told i've i've never experienced a hurricane
oh God
yeah well i guess um but typically it down there though you don't get much coldness right you get [vocalized-noise]
how well when you say cold what do you mean by cold [laughter]
oh sheesh yeah um um it's right about now when they're talking about hitting thirty five and forty degree days we're thinking heat wave
because occas- what'll what'll happen here is with the wind chill it can go below zero quite often which is not not fun i personally hate it i'm only here for school
[vocalized-noise]
uh
so you don't get the wind chill there that's nice
that's nice uh i uh my my goal is to move some place south
so that i don't have to worry about winters any more and just worry about you know an occasional thirty five degree day i can handle but
the the the the sad part about here is that winter starts in
um in you know early Sept- or September October and then it ends in March or April so there isn't that much summer and spring and fall here
it's pretty much you know lots of winter and uh it's a very long winter semicold winter and a fairly gray winter usually so
not uh not fun
is it that low you think uh
um that's not too ba-
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] a little barb wire fence huh [laughter]
well i've only been out uh i've only been in the west once so uh i was in uh i was in Iowa
and it was bitter cold when i was there and that's the way that's north um that's sort of north
midwest though
so way way north of where you are so i i uh my experience wasn't wasn't quite
down there i i i like i said i want to wind up somewhere down in that range where it's nice and warm and
you know when when when you get twenty five cold days a year rather than twenty five warm days a year
which is what we wind up with [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
okay
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
really okay well see i'm the third oldest of twelve children
[noise] and i like [vocalized-noise] so i like i said i
i'm only twenty one i'll be twenty two next month so there's nine that are younger than me my youngest sister is five
and like i s- i don't have any children i'm just engaged and i'm getting married in October and we haven't discussed this at all so um
[laughter] yeah exactly but um now i've noticed that like while i'm at college and when i go home my brothers you know my i'm really close to the younger ones and um
like wh- wh- like when i do go home they enjoy just l-
laying around me you know like if we do watch TV at night they just like enjoy just like laying on top of me or something
they like that but um as far as that goes like we play games i play like Old Maid and Fish with them
and w- we play board games and when it's ni- like i'm from Pennsylvania so when it's nice out
we go outside and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff so
we do a lot of that and in the summer everyone is like
i think there's like seven of us still at home and all seven are in a sport like also they're either in base- the girls are in softball and the boys are in baseball
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports that's it you know
uh-huh
yeah
right yeah we go and watch
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well it's funny because um well my mom and dad both were kind of athletic they both grew up on a farm
but although you know it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such
my mom and dad got into it more than i did i mean they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling you know so
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as as the kids and i found like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff
it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu- you know get into fights who can scream louder and you know everything so it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it and they're not really even participating
yeah
um-hum
yeah it's um th- the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real- we really don't have any privacy when we're at home because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms
but um like i say you know i'm twenty i'll be twenty two next month and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age
and that's i think that's because well the ones that are older all have their own little thing to do
and the younger kids are at home and i like to spend time with them so
i don't i you know
we were all pretty close when we were younger
yeah now that we're getting older people are gett- you know each one of us are going our own direction
uh-huh
[noise] oh yeah and um we you know we had blocks and stuff and
[laughter]
we just did we would make like in the winter when it wa- we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff
we um [laughter]
we would um
[laughter]
clear out our basement and we would like do just even stupid things like we try hurtling our couches and stuff
you know does it [laughter]
yeah we would just run and jump over the couches [vocalized-noise]
yeah to see who could jump over you know we just made up our own stupid little games and like hide and seek well we have a a bigger house than a lot you know our house isn't the average small one
so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that
yeah
[noise] well see they're um we're all
like we're all pretty close together like m- my sister that's closest to me we're only fourteen months apart
so there was always there was never just one alone you know
[vocalized-noise]
right so we were all pretty close where we we always had a buddy to play with you know
no no not at all
not at all [laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
well yeah i'm Catholic [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
no not at all not at all
but see um when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five well i've even cut that down now and um
but to me five wasn't even a lot because i was just so used to twelve you know
[laughter]
but yeah it's so it would be really hard now to have twelve children
we- well
well okay well like my oldest brother he's he's twenty four and he put himself through college
and um there's a sister older than me she's still living at home but she works
you know and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit you know of rent money
[noise] and i'm putting myself through college and like i'm getting married in October my fiance and i are paying for most of the wedding
and then then my brother right behind me he moved out and he has an apartment and he works
and then the next one down is in the Marines and he's out of the house so it's kind of like
they don't you know
i- i think they do
um-hum
exactly like um well i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because
i've always had a bank account i've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade
you know i would work in the summer and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or you know
to to manage money like my roommate's laughing like you know like me you know because
th- their schooling's paid for
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah and see and then my mom and dad like whenever w- like we would go out and we would get a summer job
and then we would start blowing money and my mom said well that's stupid for you to be blowing money she goes okay if your going to blow your money on other things she goes you can just pay for your life insurance
so then we when we all graduated from h- college from high school
[noise] we all got we're still like i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school but i have my own policy too
so i had a poli- you know my mom and dad got it set up you know you know helped me to get it and everything and i have my own policy and then i pay for my own life insurance too
and then
and then like my mom and dad because there's so many of us and because of the way
the laws are you know now if we want to drive we have to pay for our own insurance on our cars
because my mom said that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it if we were in a wreck you know you can be sued for anything now
and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids
if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad and the little kids would have nothing
and i- i agree with her you know i just i don't know
so if you know if we want to drive we pay our own insurance and
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
[noise]
i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed um
but anyway so so as far as w- we really we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of TV
because we both were raised you know that way you know where our parents sort of stuck us in front of a TV to be the babysitter
and we just don't want that we want more communication and interaction you know amongst us as a family
and we both like sports so we figured well what what better way to get out and
you know be together as a family and also you know have it be good for you and plus we like we both like to cook so
you know that's something we spend time together too is you know cooking and uh preparing meals and stuff so
[vocalized-noise] but as far as that that's about all we've discussed for
family
oh my gosh
oh yeah
yeah long way down the road right [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
well do do so you go if you're if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers'
sporting events and sort of like be there with them
yeah
well that's that's good too i mean as far as entering [vocalized-noise] i mean you're you're
participating but you're not you know i mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff and that's because
um even if our kids you know get into sports that we're really not interested in i don't i want them
you know to know that we're still there you know so to speak as a family that
yeah cheering you on and stuff
yeah well that that would be fun boy so you you have a lot of experience as far
you know different ways a family can interact and and do things together as far as God twelve
but it's so if you're not i- what if do do people go off in their own little groups with that many i mean did like some people go to their rooms and
yeah
hum
yeah
but when you were growing up and they weren't and the younger ones weren't around what did you do
oh i see but now that they've all sort of moved off
yeah
so do you think even i mean what did you do when you were younger did you go do the board games and stuff you still did what you do now
um-hum
hurling
oh hurtle oh okay
so you you had a lot of games and things you played even when you were kids with the ones that y-
yeah
yeah no not real spread in age
yeah
gosh twelve is that is that pretty common up there uh in oh okay
because i don't meet the i mean i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more i mean
my my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen but i mean that's his mother you know and and they're Catholic and and i mean that's
well that's it then i think probably maybe that that
but i mean do you see yourself having thirteen kids or twelve kids
yeah
yeah
i can imagine
but it's so expensive man
i would think for your parents it would be it would still be hard even nowadays i mean just to raise twelve kids
would be [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
so well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though you know i mean
you don't expect anything because
there is not enough to go around for everybody so you you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself if you really want it
um-hum
yeah
or manage money or know yeah know you know how to get how to even go about getting money you know how to get a job or or you know
just what you know what when you get a job what your responsibility is are you going to blow all that money how easy it is to blow money you earn
um-hum
wow you've really got responsibilities
yeah
yeah well
so so really i think
sometimes there's an advantage i mean sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent you know it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted
and when you get something you're lucky to get it so to speak you know
so um i don't know um sometimes but now it it is hard i can imagine on your parents you know
[noise]
hi Carol
how do you feel about uh lawn and garden work
[laughter] so you feel good about it [laughter]
what kind of a system does he have does he have a power mower or a riding mower
so you let him enjoy it
[laughter] you don't feel [laughter] you don't feel guilty about it
[laughter]
oh
it's a it's a push mower though
yeah but it's it's power power but you have to push it i've uh i've got to admit that the last two lawn mowers that i've gotten um were uh power driven
they're they're uh you know they're gasoline and they have a mechanical contraption on it you pull the handle and it pulls the lawn mower for you
um it takes me about an hour to do to to do my lawn
and uh well if you if you g- got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh
i i feel a lot better doing it with a
power mower with that with a [laughter] with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard
but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks
and uh
i also have o- other garden equipment like uh
weed whacker or the trimmer to go around all of the the uh fence and everything
does he have those as well
oh this this come- with the blade on it you mean uh-huh
is that a power mower or is that a power edger or is it a
oh
yeah
[laughter]
how often does he do it
all right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
so so the state is encouraging you to do that
uh-huh
do they do something to the lawn mower to to help it uh stay inside or they
uh-huh
yeah
but they don't they they they have special munching mulching uh mowers but that's not one of them
it is not
oh i always thought that it was
yeah
oh that's interesting
maybe there's something i can try this time around
[noise]
huh
does he have the lawn treated
oh well i um i tried it about ten years ago and i've been doing it ever since i've been having it treated
and it makes it grow much faster uh [laughter]
our season though in New England uh is is only three months or so and then it starts getting cold again in Septem-
[laughter] so we don't have um i guess out in Dallas you must have a a longer season
no kidding [laughter]
[laughter] no kidding
wow
oh we i- i don't go that uh that deep it starts getting cold wh- as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass
i know in the summer time i've got to uh i've got to h- actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass
i can't cut it i think it's the recommended three three and a half inches they want me to leave it
so i can cut it
[laughter]
well in the summer time so that the heat doesn't uh burn the grass
and they recommend that i keep the blade very high
so because it's that high i have to do it frequently as well i try to do it every uh uh six or seven days
if
um i rea- i've got a mixture i guess [laughter]
[laughter] it's all different kind- but if i let it grow too long if i let it go like a week and a half two weeks then it starts seeding on me
and that's it gets too long and then it uh starts bunching up underneath the lawn mower and i can't get it out and and it's uh it it turns out to be a real mess so i've got to do it uh
uh no later than once a week
and i uh i don't block off my my uh chute but i don't pick up my grass either
i leave it on the lawn and uh i try to go over it again i do pick up or i rake up uh
you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there
i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper
yeah that's kind of that's kind of like uh the old-fashioned carpet sweeper only it's it's wide and you put it on your grass and what it does is it sweeps the lawn and it only picks up
you know the height that you you set it at so i set it very high and it just picks or it skims the grass it doesn't dig way down deep so i don't have a lot of grass that i uh that i collect
oh yeah works very good with leaves because leaves typ- if you pick them up right away uh they'll sit on top of the grass
and uh i'm trying to find a way how to uh electrify it or motorize it because of this i have to push
but it uh it's it's wide enough to pick up uh like the width two widths of a lawn mower
so you can do it relatively quickly
i [noise] i try to take the the clippings and uh
put them in a mulching not a mulching but uh
to let them decompose
i think that is mul- uh what do they call that
compost pile [laughter]
i haven't been very successful i'm on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesn't decompose i guess i got
[laughter] you supposed to put chemicals on it
no [laughter]
it's [vocalized-noise]
it's not working
[laughter]
it's getting it's shrinking down it's getting small
but it uh it's still grass it's it's dried up grass and it it just stays there it doesn't turn into dirt
what air it out
uh-huh
huh
yeah
i'm going to have to try and do that
[laughter] maybe it'll work
uh the other thing i was thinking of doing is getting some chemicals to try and help the process up uh a little more a little faster
chem- no chemicals in it
yeah
i um i'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because of the uh
um i guess what i didn't realize was that that they're actually putting poisons on my grass
and it wasn't until uh a year or two ago where the state required anyone putting chemicals on lawns that they tell the the customers what they're actually putting on the lawn and what the uh the hazards are
and uh my children are all grown up now but
when they were younger i was fertilizing my grass and didn't realize that some of the the chemicals that are on the grass that are being put on by the chemical companies um stay there longer than
than than a few hours
and yeah and my uh dog was out there playing in the grass and they were playing in the grass so i don't what long term effects that they uh the chemicals
had on the grass but that's bothered me to the point where i'm th- thinking about discontinuing it this year
and try to get more uh [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
hi Frank
uh well to tell you the truth my husband does most of the work yeah i feel real good about it
yeah no he has a um
you know um a push mower i mean it's electric of course um i i think it's not very old about
[noise] um not that old three or four years old maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so
yeah that's fine [laughter]
[laughter]
no well
last uh no i do enough other things i don't feel guilty about that
last year this is i'm almost ashamed to admit it but last year for the very first time i did mow the grass
my first time in my whole life
and uh that wasn't too bad i it was good exercise
well you know it's electric of course i mean it's a power a power mower it it's it's pretty powerful oh yeah
um-hum
that's about the same for ours
yeah
oh yeah uh-huh
oh yes um let's see we've got a
weed whacker we have an uh edger you know that goes between the grass and the sidewalk
um
right um
that one is electric so he's got to plug that in and drag the cord around
and let's see um hedge clippers you know electric of course he- hedge clippers
um i think that's all of the power tools we have
we um but that's that's i think that's about all they make [laughter]
[laughter]
oh once a week um actually though um we just moved
to uh Texas a year and a half ago
and they have a new uh
system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it um
[noise] essentially you know cutting it um probably more like every four or five days and
so it's still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass
and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on waste for landfills and all of that
um it's actually through the County Extension Service
and they put out all kinds of information on it
and then they put up uh they had a few lawns in the area that were like uh samples and they put a big sign in their yard that said you know this is a don't bag it lawn
and let you watch and see how they did it so their grass clippings were never bagged they just mulch back into the grass itself and acted as a fertilizer
yeah as a matter of fact and our lawn mower does that too it's you you shut off the where the bag would go or where it would you know spray out the side
so that it just mulches underneath it just goes back down um right underneath the blade
right
no that's no that's not it's not necessary to have that nope
but y-
y- you have to but you're you're right though in that you do have to cut it though when it's
um relatively short you can't let it go a week or two because if the clippings are that long then they'll just lay on top
they have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down um into the grass
it ta- takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do it every four or five days
um since he doesn't have to bag all of those clippings you know i- rather than taking i don't know as an example an hour and a half to do the whole lawn it only takes an hour
so you know plus less bags less waste
um we tried that but we really weren't happy with it so he does that all himself now
yeah
oh that's true [laughter]
oh gee i- i'd say our grass is getting green right now so i'm sure he'll in fact he may have already cut it once i can't remember
um but it'll be yeah we'll have to start cutting real soon
and uh
then oh well i- on into October November i'm sure
right
let it get that long wow
right
what kind of grass do you have
uh-huh
right
right
um-hum
right
oh really we don't have one of those
uh-huh
oh [vocalized-noise]
does it work for leaves
oh
right
[laughter]
oh well
oh yeah
well that's sounds interesting we uh we don't
well i don't know if we do that very much
i think i remember my mom had one of those
i don't know
right
a compost pile right
it's not composting [laughter]
[laughter]
i don't think so no i think it's supposed to be natural
[laughter]
oh well [laughter]
i think you're supposed to turn it every once in a while
well i think it it on the inside is where it the chemicals you know it starts to break down
and i think if you're supposed to turn it
i mean not not very often but you know go in and and stir it up so to speak to get the
stuff on the outside in to the inside
it might help i don't know
[laughter]
yeah
i don't know i i i think the idea is supposed to be natural so that
you know there's no
no chemicals and plus then you can use it as a fertilizer and not have to worry about
spreading those chemicals like on your lawn or your bushes or whatever
uh-huh
and they're playing on they were playing on it
sure
yeah
[noise]
no i haven't have you
uh-huh it's not the length isn't too long
uh-huh
oh well [vocalized-noise]
really i've heard different opinions about it uh uh-huh one that you know yeah it was too long and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end and it didn't and it kept going on and uh-huh
[noise] really now i've seen you know some different clips of it um
and it it looks good it's just i haven't had the time to go to the movies lately [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh oh [laughter]
[vocalized-noise] hey that'd work for me let me tell you [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh now i've seen another clip of um
the guy that plays in Murphy Brown i don't know his name but he's he played the uh the the character in it that
was very like gross i mean very dirty an- oh i saw the one clip of him and ugh it when he was first i guess he was taking Kevin Costner to
like the site where he was going to be or whatever
that was rather um gross [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah but other than that i've heard the the you know the um
the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful
uh-huh really
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] uh-huh
the styles [noise] uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh [noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh well i guess i will have to see it then
um actually have been to the movies um i think the last movie i saw was Misery
oh very suspenseful
i really don't either but i went with someone and once i was there i couldn't believe i mean it's an excellent movie yeah
it's not necessarily it it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful i mean it's not
no in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off but in the movie she she
disables him but not by cutting his feet um she she breaks both of his ankles
and that i couldn't watch and but you know you could tell when it was coming
so yeah um that was so that he couldn't leave her cause she
yeah yeah i mean uh
yeah well as far as that goes yeah i mean you wouldn't like to see anybo- anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions
and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer and it was just
but she was a killer and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that
so
but [laughter] so yeah we just haven't had the time to go to the movies [noise] lately
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy
um that yeah it looks good and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time now see i
yeah i don't think i want to see that either i know i don't i don't think i could
really
really
[noise]
uh-huh now suppose that
oh well i liked that movie yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
well i guess that's about it [laughter]
[laughter] it was nice okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
Cindy have you seen Dances With Wolves
oh that is a wonderful movie
no oh goodness no you don't even you don't even realize it you know
really
oh i thought it was great yeah
well yeah oh i heard a story about there's a there's a certain scene in the movie where there's um
where they're where they're on a buffalo hunt and they have a particular child actor uh who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo
and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo i can't remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for Oreo cookies
[laughter] and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with Oreo cookies
[laughter] i thought that was really funny
oh yeah
oh yeah
yeah the wagon the wagon driver
yeah
and uh the costuming
yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the
of the actual stuff but they didn't they didn't age it
quite enough it seemed but it was a very good movie
what have you seen lately
oh i didn't see that
i don't i don't like Stephen King
really i wasn't sure because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i- i just don't want to have anything to do with it
yeah i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know
hum
ugh
yeah
it still just seems a little twisted to me [laughter] i'm not sure i would have enjoyed that at all
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah
i know we don't see movies at the movies a lot the last we did go see Dances With Wolves and we went to see Not Without My Daughter but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them [laughter]
oh yeah that looks really good too
and Silence of the Lambs i'm i'm intrigued by it but i'm not sure i want to go see it yet [laughter]
i think [vocalized-noise]
well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects
now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um
strange in other ways
okay
maybe we'll talk to you again
alright bye-bye
[noise]
okay [laughter]
oh i hadn't seen that but i've heard that it's real good
uh-huh
oh
yeah
oh [noise]
well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies we went to see Awakenings
with Robin Williams and we went to see Kindergarten Cop
[noise]
and i really liked both of them i really did Awakening
was it was kind of sad to me it really was and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really don't know that much about it
yeah
yeah yeah
uh-huh but the drugs [vocalized-noise] didn't work for long and they started having real bad side effects
and this is about nineteen sixty four i believe or something like that and there still hasn't been any you know new development in
prescribed drugs that can help it
but yeah there you know it
it was a big breakthrough but in time you know the all the side effects started showing
bad
[noise]
yeah yeah they was actually went back like they were you know
yeah
all it was they wasn't mild you know they was just
bad side effects
but it [vocalized-noise] i really enjoyed it though
you know
oh yeah [laughter] that's strictly for entertainment [laughter] that was just [laughter] it was
yeah
he sure is he is as a matter of fact um [noise]
Sylvester Stallone is that his name i really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie- variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good
you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher
it was really good
oh i've seen that yes
it is it is isn't it yes
yes
yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah yeah
yeah i did too i really did
i enjoy a lot of movies now as far as let's say heavy violence i can't handle
i'm not into that
you know i ju- like Rambo and all that
i that's just
something i just don't want to watch
oh
oh my goodness
yes
oh uh-huh
yeah
oh
i guess i'm a little too scary for that
oh uh-huh
yes yes
yes
it is it really is yes
watching yeah
oh i don't wanna go home yes yes [laughter] oh goodness
yes oh
yes i know uh i have two children i really try to watch what they watch i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know
[laughter] he'll come in mama i think the ghost is in the house mama i hear it
don't you
they're eight and ten
so they're you know they hadn't really distinguished it's just a movie you know i try to say it's just a movie but no mama i've seen it [laughter]
oh uh-huh
oh
oh
oh
die oh [laughter] oh
it's funny how your little minds work isn't it oh
oh [laughter]
oh i guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars people like us you know [laughter]
oh goodness
well well i've enjoyed talking to you
and maybe we'll run across each other again
do you well as far as we could not call in last week
you know from where i'm at
we couldn't call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared
so i missed several days [vocalized-noise] because i was getting quite a few calls
[noise]
oh uh-huh oh
yes
oh
[noise]
oh well my husband sometimes you know he'll receive a call and he's at work
and if i you know if i know the topic i'll go ahead and accept it as mine but the other day i got one about fishing and i thought oh my
[noise]
i don't know a thing about fishing so
i'm not even going to try [laughter]
because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time believe me
but i'm yeah but i'm really not for sure though [laughter] well i'll let you go and we'll talk to you later okay bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter] all right last thing i saw was um i think uh Sleeping With the Enemy with Julia Roberts
my husband didn't like it that much i thought it was okay it was a little strange you know this woman supposedly is um
being mentally abused by her husband you know he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house and she figures out this way to um
to leave him secretly you know she fakes her death kind of thing and he tracks her down [laughter]
so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he's in the house you know after her but uh
kind of had the feeling along that uh why didn't she just tell him to straighten up [laughter] you know why didn't she just tell hi- hey look bucko you don't get away with this nonsense [laughter]
but anyhow um what have you seen
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh so this is where the people have been kind of
well i don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time and the drugs let them come back
oh
um
well how bad were the side effects
oh
oh um
um
um
well how about Kindergarten Cop
[laughter]
you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know at first he was just a big muscle man but he's kind of branching out
uh-huh
[laughter]
um
well there was a movie out it's been on cable i get cable and there's this thing with uh Danny De Vito called Twins
i thought that was just great
i even like some i mean some of the original stuff like i like The Terminator at first you know it was kind of strange but i still like watching him in The Terminator and and some of the other things um
Total Recall last year i thought was really good last summer
guess it didn't last too long at the box office but i thought it was pretty good
and it was
um
um
yeah
yeah and i i have some [laughter] one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks
and i just keep telling her how can you do that and i told her when she had her her little girl i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those you shouldn't be watching them with your little girl
and she says her little girl's into it now
and she wa- she watches these really gross things you know like The Nightmare on Elm Street and the you know that kind of junk i don't go for that at all
i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie and
it was like this h- big house had a basement and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years
you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie
you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff and it's true i i had a lot of things that i i nobody told me that it was all fake i was just sitting there watching it going oh jeez
[laughter]
but i think a lot of kids it's funny get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed
where do we get that from
[laughter]
um
how old are they
[laughter]
oh but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten and we rented Charlotte's Web okay
and he just bawled at the end and just uh she's not going to die and we were trying to say Kenny it's okay and he didn't want to listen to it
he just was beside himself you know this is supposed to be a nice children's movie Charlotte's Web he just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end
[laughter]
oh yeah she's so nice no she can't die [laughter] oh it was jus-
[laughter] oh
you too
yeah this is kind of neat i haven't ever initiated a call i've just been called you know by the switchboard and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it but i normally get a call like every other day
um
uh-huh
um
how weird
i don't know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution [laughter]
it was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures i was going oh well [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water
[laughter]
alrighty bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
really oh that's the way it is up here like today it was fifty and raining and two days ago it was snowing a blizzard up here so [laughter] it just it just likes kind of crazy all over the country i guess
it's seventy five down there yeah that's not too hard to take
yeah
uh-huh well it does that up here well we get a lot of weather that's that's uh controlled by the ocean we're s- we're so close to the ocean here in Rhode Island are you familiar with with Attleboro at all or in Massachusetts
okay
okay well New England is kind of kind of like uh pretty close sits right on the Atlantic Ocean and we get you know a lot of a lot of the weather is driven by the winds coming in off the ocean the northeast winds bring in
all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes we'll get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know
but
yeah it it's not bad uh i i was i was in Abilene for ten years i worked in Abilene for ten years so
i'm kind of familiar with the weather out that way in west Texas but not in not in Lewisville
is that right ev- everybody's sick down there [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctor's visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it
you're absolutely right you don't know how to dress you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because it's real cold and by noontime you're taking everything off you know to to go walk around the site and stuff
and and it's unreal that uh uh you know by evening you can drop back twenty thirty degrees it's just the weather changes so quick you know
and if you don't have coats and sweaters with you of course by then you're all sweated up and warm and that's how i think a lot folks carry
yeah my uh the older i get the less i like the cold up here i'll tell you [laughter] i think that i think that uh you know it just takes it's toll and uh and uh
when you get when you're young you kind of can tolerate a lot of a lot of cold weather and stuff
you're right you're sure right it's it's nice to look at but the last couple of storms we've had the last couple of snowstorms we've had have really been good because they snowed and and like within a day it's warmed right back up and melted the roads and stuff so
we're able to get around pretty good and it didn't stay too long on the sides of the roads but
uh
oh i've
uh-huh i guess you've seen some pretty weather up there too
yep
yeah
uh-huh that's the way i found [noise] that's the way i found Abilene in the winter
[noise]
[noise] yeah there's no see the humidity up here too is really bad in the summertime it's really bad it can be seventy five eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety ninety five percent and boy your just like you're in an oven roasting i'll tell you
but West Texas now was a hundred and ten and i didn't mind that at all you know because it was so dry
uh-huh
yeah that's nice out through there i've got a
i've got a son lives in Riverside and i drove across the Mohave Desert went to Las Vegas i went from route five to Las Vegas by car and that was a pretty nice trip
i was surprised that last year was my first trip out there i'd never been to California and i went through out to Death Valley and
it was like a hundred and twenty five or something and it it didn't feel that hot
it it like strange that it you're right in the middle of the mountains and it's so brown and dry but boy you just didn't feel
it didn't feel that hot
uh-huh yeah [laughter] that's the hard thing out that way but uh i liked Riverside though the weather in Riverside was pretty good in California wa- it wa- i have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona so
that was pretty good but the weather here in New England like like they say if you don't like it too well well just stick around a little bit and [vocalized-noise] and it it will change up and give you something that you may like worse or like more it all depends on on Mother Nature's kind of fickle up this way i guess
uh-huh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this
that's what we get real cold weather where the wind blows down out of Canada is called that uh Canadian express and boy that winds comes down and it and it seems to make a big dip
sometimes it dips all the way down to you folks down in Texas and then it roars back up the east coast here by the time we get it it is hauling some cold weather
yeah
boy that's unreal when you think about it you know that's that must be something uh to
well they say these big icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic then you see the tip of them they look like small mountains and that's only like one third of the iceberg the rest of it submerged under the water
and that's been uh uh a problem you know to to the merchant people that that fish and stuff up here they run into that ice stuff in the winter and it breaks away
i've lived here all my life and i worked uh i've been with uh TI fifteen years ten of it in in Texas five years up here
[noise]
but i've lived up here all my life and i'm
fifty eight years old so i i c-
yeah that's right next door to us Connecticut's not that far away did she like it up here in Connecticut
it's nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because that's that's something that you just can't paint a picture of or
and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors
and uh that that's really nice to look at uh the summers are hot pardon me
no we have a lot of maple up here and oak mostly oak and maple is is a and and pine of course evergreens up as you get up north into the northern part of the
the eastern corner here it's all pine trees and
but uh i guess the hardwoods are probably
the biggest thing we have are our hard maple and hard oak and and the the evergreens
but that's scattered with birch trees and stuff and uh it's real pretty when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors and
people come from all over the world come through New England only like that [noise] week or two when the colors are the brightest you know
oh sure because it's so warm
yeah
uh-huh
well uh yeah th- i- it's kind of one more week here i guess and we'll be into uh into the springtime i g- we got another week of winter he- just about right we'll be out of the out of the winter and into the springtime and
we might get one more little snowstorm in April but i don't think it will amount to much
that's what i noticed when i was there was the ice storms you got around February one time i flew into DFW and it was iced over [laughter] we had to go into Love Field because we just couldn't get into DFW
[noise]
yeah
i think that that kills a lot of germs and stuff
yep you're absolutely right i think it does it kills germs and bugs and the same thing up here if we get a hard hard freeze in the ground we get a lot of a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the spring but if we don't boy they just seem to jump right out
and
yeah
how long have you been with TI uh
thirty two years boy that's a long time
uh you working in the in the military e- equipment
yeah D S defense systems equipment group yeah yeah i was in that
[noise]
okeydoke
down here it's been it's everybody's got colds and everything because it's cold one day and hot the next day
it's just
yep
yeah
well it is it's about
yeah it's about seventy five here today
yeah
no but uh couple of days ago it was in uh mid uh thirties at night and only warmed up to about forty five in the daytime
yeah
yeah
not not uh no not the uh the area you know i am the TI plant as far as you know what they make and everything but the weather no
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well down here they're normally Dallas normally has pretty good weather but uh
yeah
yeah but uh also the pollen down here has been terrible
if if you've got sinuses if you're bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that other stuff that gets in the air boy it's just been driving everybody crazy
yeah [vocalized-noise]
uh either sinus problems or like i say colds or flu or whatever
of course i don't know that that's real- really weather related
i think you know we just h- every once in a while have epidemics of
of viruses going around
i know i had strep throat here about a week ago week and a half ago
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well i'm a hot weather person i'm i can take the heat but i don't like the cold
yeah [laughter]
that
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah that snow is pretty to look at but i i don't like to drive in it or or
huh
i spent uh i spent a year up in Colorado Springs at TI up in Colorado Springs
it was beautiful weather and it it was real strange it could snow
and be sun shining
or right after it got through snowing you could go out in short sleeved shirt and it wasn't that uncomfortable
because of the
yeah it's a it's a dry snow it's not a wet slushy snow it's packed
yeah
yeah
yeah
no
yeah
and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California
out in the middle of the Mohave Desert
and i loved that
yeah
yeah
yeah but uh that was also a dry hot it wasn't a it wasn't a humidity hot
and uh i enjoyed it
yeah
yeah
no huh-uh especially [vocalized-noise]
right
yeah
especially if you can get find some shade
[noise]
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
it will change
yeah
they had a they had a interesting show in uh public channel down here yesterday on uh the uh ice flows and the ice age and how the weather
effected the ice ages and everything and it's real interesting
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah in fact i think they showed on the they showed the United States map a shores of course Canada or North America map and showed uh how far the ice had come down and during the last i- ice age
and i think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice [laughter]
yeah
yeah
right
right
how long have you been up there in uh Att- Attleboro
yeah
well my wife spent some time up in Connecticut
yeah
yeah
yeah she liked it and she wants to go back up there and and uh
look around you know just sight see
yeah
yeah
yeah
what do you all have aspen
you all have mostly aspen or
[vocalized-noise]
maple
yeah
yeah
well
yeah a lot of our trees and things now are are starting to bud out i sure hope we i sure hope we don't get a hard freeze [laughter] t- to kill everything now
but [vocalized-noise]
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah usually down here our worst our worst month our coldest month is usually February but we didn't have have that much of a winter this year this
yeah yeah usually
yeah
i'm i'm kind of sorry that we haven't had a real good hard fr- a long hard freeze we've had a you know we've had a freeze but just maybe one or two days
it it kills a lot of the bugs and the
yeah
yeah and i'm afraid this summer is going to be bad as far as
bugs as fleas ticks and stuff like that
but uh
uh thirty two years
yeah
yeah
uh DSEG
yeah uh-huh
here we go
i sure was Two years ago i spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day
on a jury that was uh a change of venue from Columbus Ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping
yeah it was quite a session that disrup- disrupted my whole summer of course
five days a week but it was an absolutely fascinating experience
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury Our situation was somewhat different
uh in view of the fact that uh we haven't we were a landmark case it was the first time in the state of Ohio that um D N A testing was entered as evidence
and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind uh the uh
uh the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process uh that we experienced That took one full week uh to get forty three people qualified to sit on the jury
And then it was a matter of the selection of uh twelve people after that actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates
and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good
uh and we were sequestered but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country
there was one other person besides myself we were the only ones that had ever been to college hm one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work
uh two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out looking for jobs yet um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked and then some are people who did work
so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men
and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people
uh it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind
uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh
from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything and and yet the judge said well um if you're taking notes you're missing something
and he was right there also but uh uh certainly um i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case
and if the criminal chooses to have a uh three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury
uh-huh
you're kidding
yes and money
[laughter]
yeah
yeah i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup
uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now
uh by the same token we had um uh some people who wanted to had vacations planned
and one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back and then he wasn't selected on the jury
and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins
and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme
yes
right
uh-huh
right well i guess he'd have to be careful whether with entrapment or some of those things
but uh i don't i assume you have seen on television recently as probably the whole country has the beating of the man in Los Angeles
isn't that terrible And uh you know and that certainly uh cannot be said to be uh something that happens everywhere
but the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it's it's horrendous and
it's just a stroke of luck that someone was able to get it on tape and then uh to listen to the tape recording uh at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards
yeah
absolutely
well we just had a case uh
like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid uh was trying to extra extricate um
a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest burned him
they wound up paying him uh the officer of course was fired but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit
and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman
so uh as some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous and we do need an all an overhaul and we just need more discipline country wide it would then we'd need it on that yeah
well it's been very nice talking with you
yes and uh good luck on on some other calls
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
okay um have you ever been involved in any trials
wow
sounds like it
oh it sounds like it i haven't had any actual real life experience but uh my father-in-law's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple of murders and uh
you know talking to other people who have been there and so i don't have any real experience with trials but i do you know i i've i took a little business law in in college and and i've you know try to keep abreast of things but uh
hm i think that the uh trial by jury is is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago hm
right now though it's it's so difficult because there's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial
and it's just that i think they're just tying up the um whole judicial process um there's a lot of things they could do
to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe the uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury
um-hum
uh-huh
jeez
um-hum
uh-huh
gee
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yes yes i agree uh would surprise me that uh when i was in Texas i had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket
and um i went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket
no and i thought my God talk about tying up things for for
yes i mean that's extremely expensive i mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial
i'm like God this is ridiculous [laughter]
um-hum
oh my God
yes i- i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process
i mean some things are just so cut and dry um in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now i mean you know when you start thinking about well they've got videotape and
and audio tapes and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people [laughter] to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial
yes
[noise] that was horrible
that it
yeah
yes i know i mean i only heard portions of that but it's absolutely terrible and you know if you beat a dog like that they'll put you in jail
you know
jeez
uh
yes i- i believe that too
well it's been nice talking with you
okay thank you you do the same bye-bye
[noise]
yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh
much recommended
uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good
even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this show [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah yeah
well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to
fall short of
of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in
and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more
i mean you know ba- basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say more slapstick [laughter]
yeah it is it is [vocalized-noise] and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at
oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies eh the the French movies uh Teti it it
um
no i'm not with you so far [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
ha ha
uh-huh
oh yeah
they have they have a long [vocalized-noise] yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Ame- quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and there's something about it
that's so innovative you know he'll just have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick there's something about the human character in it
and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone
there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature
does does that make since to you
[noise]
yeah yeah did you go with kids though
did you go with kids
did you take kids along
ah
oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them [laughter]
especially to come home and you know [laughter] [vocalized-noise] if he didn't knock real loudly and clearly i would have gotten in trouble the next day i'm sure
oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh um-hum
um-hum
and your cousin's a kid
uh-huh
yeah wasn't it amazing
yeah those
yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get [vocalized-noise] epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head
yeah it it's a little disturbing
the violence in these films part- it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like
i i read an article one time talking about even the [vocalized-noise] the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there
if you see people who are severely injured it's
very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence
and i'm not really sure how i feel about that [laughter]
uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either
but yeah T- Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they [vocalized-noise] i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful
and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater
[vocalized-noise] it could have been you know it was it was innovative it's a it's completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable
cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed
again i didn't have a kid with me
and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with
um and he had to pa- and he told them remember [vocalized-noise] remember you
[vocalized-noise] united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that
they didn't fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him
and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth
the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth
and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids
if they had included all this stuff that
i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that [vocalized-noise] and it would have make it uh
broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought
but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that
i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing
yeah yeah i i i i'm very i'm very critical [noise] i i i'm actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my my father works in films and such and i tend to
tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um
and th- that's what they're for
but i don't i don't remember them
and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something
um-hum
yeah yeah they leave the
yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i don't know what it is
but it just
i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i'm not that old [laughter] i look you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was
okay well um [laughter] thanks for hearing me ramp i guess [laughter] all right nice talking with you
okay
no i'm in California
so they're paying the phone bill
yeah there must be Texas people as near as i can tell no okay i'm from the other coast all right bye bye
[noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah right uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know usually people tell you how good they are and you always
you know end up with uh expectations too high or whatever
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
right
yeah [laughter]
yeah i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's uh not really the way comedies are right now
you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore
uh-huh
yeah that well that's true it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie [laughter]
excuse me
no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh
uh the one about the the French uh the Frenchman that leaves and comes back and he's someone different um
he's uh uh well it's about a man uh
that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife and his wife's all excited but the the guy that comes back is not her original husband
but um
[vocalized-noise] Gear um i'm sure you've heard of it it was a very famous uh popular movie Norman Gray Norman Gear
um
oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up i'll remember the name
but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city
and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown
but uh so this uh French i guess are into the slapsti- i guess so they would like Jerry Lewis yeah [laughter]
[noise]
right
oh uh-huh
right
um-hum
right
yeah uh-huh
yeah i see what you're saying there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than
and how it fits with the character right
[noise] excuse me
no we went uh without the kids it's was a a night out
away from the children
oh
[laughter]
[noise] oh
uh-huh
yeah that that's true i i was thinking about that too i saw that um
that's why i watched another silly movie um [noise] um with my my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles
right yeah i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into
and that is yeah he's a little yeah [vocalized-noise] anyway um and that was just
excessively violent i was worried it's like golly if kids start imitating that
they'll knock each others blocks off
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
right
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah right
uh-huh
yeah it's true
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah right oh
[laughter]
right
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
right
that's true
yeah there's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that you that that you wouldn't want to change something and there's always something that uh
um-hum
oh really
uh-huh
yeah right
uh-huh
right
exactly yeah there there there are a couple movies that hit home like that most of the ones i always remember are the the older ones
i always like the musicals and uh those ones uh those stick in your head
uh-huh
no it could be
[laughter]
[noise]
uh-huh
um
okay well i guess i got to get going got to go take care of the children
[laughter]
yeah nice talking with you are you calling from Texas by the way
oh okay the first person i've talked to outside of Texas
yeah okay well thank you very much bye bye
[noise]
well the roles of women have certainly changed over the last uh decade or two and
i wonder if the the stresses that it puts on the the woman's body is uh all that good for her as it were had had there been enough adjustments in society
to help the woman cope with what she has to go through um
support group wise or or just all the different aspects that men have developed over the years to handle what the world does to them uh how how is the woman's world coming along in that respect
do you think a matter of choice or economics both
uh-huh
yeah that's true
you know that's an interesting point that you brought up about the the fact that they essentially always have been under stress uh i would say more
in the later latter years even those who stayed home had stress but when you're
the one or the two out of ten women staying home on the block uh then the stresses that you do have uh the normal day-to-day stresses caring for children or whatever is occurring
uh you could go to at one time one era you could go to the other dozens of wives on the block or you could meet for tea or whatever and you had that stress relief uh built in
uh whereas now with it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever percentage happens to be in your neighborhood like for our neighborhood we're looking at
ninety percent working women let's say uh there's no place for the wife to go when she has uh those kind of of stresses to be relieved
so
that's right about two months ago Omni Magazine which is a a science magazine are you familiar with that read an article um really restating some conclusions of some some uh
programs or some investigations or research whatever you want to call it into the the actual physical differences between men and women and questioning whether those physical differences
uh accounted for some of the differences in ways women handled stress as opposed to men
and i guess to just barely summarize what the article said
was that in the the womb the differing levels of testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain the base of the brain affected essentially how the brain was connected to the rest of the body
uh now how that has to deal with stress i'm not really sure since i thought most of the stress had to do with you know from the from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body
but it was an interesting uh uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the [vocalized-noise]
for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have
have managed to do all these years and maybe it will take a lot longer before the phy- physical evolution or for lack of a better term will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through
right
right
yeah the subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they need [laughter] that's it would be an exhausted test uh how about the the area of role models or roles as it were when you
you know teach the boy that uh he fixes the car and the woman fixes the meal uh
not not arguing that there should be a role for a sex but should there be
uh a set of not not a specific role let's say let's not say that only the the girls should do the cooking but at any given generation or for any given
uh compatibility if you want a couple to be together shouldn't they have uh defined roles as it were
uh certainly capable of sharing the other role for nothing more than empathy i mean it you know at least they understand what the other person is going through
uh not being a tremendous cook i- i know what the burden of preparing a meal but i don't know what [vocalized-noise] it would have taken to make that meal taste any better out on the budget i give her that kind of deal
[noise]
so i- i wonder i don't have any argument or any problem with women changing a given role as long as there's something on the other side let's say of of any relationship to
to match that i mean you don't want two people doing the same thing in the relationship
so
uh-huh
yeah i
i- i know one that's st- that way but that's about it i'm down to one friend that holds that position still i'm the only one home right now and i i have the kids clamoring for my attention now so i understand what that's like
now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are
i think it's come along very slowly i think that uh a lot of the stresses that you talk about ha- have
[vocalized-noise] have taken a long time to become recognized but more strides are made toward addressing those stresses in women than ever were in men and
i think that
you know women have had stress
you know for the last two hundred years but it's been a different kind of stress different kinds of situations because just being in the work place
is different from being at home but at home you still have work to do you still have things to take care of but you don't have the responsibilities and the pressures that you have in the work place
so a lot of women have a little bit of trouble adjusting to that but i feel like the
in in the last couple of decades the
the roles have almost come full circle because you know early on people were wanting to we were wanting to stay home with the kids
and then they got into everybody has to have a career and it seems to be going back to
a lot of women wanting to stay home with their kids although i don't think it'll ever go back to the way it used to be there will still be many many women who seek careers uh before they seek family
both i think it's it's a matter of both um
ec- economics has a lot to do with it unfortunately but uh i think a lot of choice
has gone into it lately and and most of them o- or a lot of women i know would rather
um if they have children they would rather stay home with them if if they if they possible can
uh-huh
yeah your neighbors
that's true
yeah
right there's no one for her to go talk to and there's also no one to to kind of come in and take over for her and allow her some time to herself for even a day you know because there's fewer and fewer people left or women that left at home to do that
um-hum yeah
um-hum
hum
yeah
right right
yeah i agree with that i it it's something that um
you know i guess science will eventually have all the answers to everything i don't know but it seems like it it would really be
it's it's really difficult to put two p- a male and a female in the same role in the same circumstances
and have them react to have them and their bodies react to the same situation in si- similar ways i think
you know even between a same sexes in a different in the same role there would there would be differences in the way one guy handled something over the way another guy would handle it so i- i think when you put a male and a female in
in and when in comparison you know it would be uh completely different i mean just just totally different
and it you know goes a lot of it goes back to the way you were raised as children you know the males are raised to believe this and be this way and the females are raised to believe something else and be this way
and uh
when when you're raised that way [vocalized-noise]
y- you kind of perpetuate that
oh
those ideals that other people uh force upon you
and so you don't you're not able to well i- i guess you are able to if you want to change them but y- you stay in those roles
for so long that it's it's hard to to adjust and it would take a a really long time for ethnic science to figure out you know what affects women
how and how the same thing affects men i think it i just don't think it's any kind of study they can do in any even twenty or thirty year period of time you know
that's right
[laughter]
[laughter] it would
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
to pick up the slack yeah
that's right yeah yeah you have to it has to balance out
and i guess that's when you get into relationships and people
people are attracted to people who compliment them most often i mean they say opposites attract and i'm not too sure i believe that very much but uh i think that people when they get into relationships you know if there's somebody who
l- like if you got two people who hate to cook they're going to eat out all the time and that you know that's not that big a deal but you know if you get somebody who likes to cook and someone who doesn't like to cook then the person who doesn't who doesn't like to cook probably likes to do something else you know
so i think that people end up i think that that women are more diverse now than they ever were as far as what they have learned and what they're capable of and
and uh what they're willing to do and so i feel like it you know that men have gotten to be that way too they've gotten a little bit more relaxed in their thinking about
uh women and you know what they expect of them so i think that you know it's a slow evolution but i think it's it's it's a good
process i think it's it's working you know
there are still people who men who believe that women should be home you know all day
and cooking dinner [laughter] my husband's in the kitchen cooking dinner saying right on right on
yeah
[laughter]
yes so i- i you know think that there are very few men who still feel that way and very few women who will tolerate a man who feels that way
[noise]
uh
being a former drug user [laughter]
i uh i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it
uh because i know
that uh
[noise] in using drugs i was not a good employee
[noise] and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there [noise] uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets
and uh
a- bu- you're also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp
uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases and
uh i work for a tire company Modern Tire and uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur
and what we do is we'll have a drug test i- if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then he's automatically uh given a drug trest
yes when he goes to the doctor the first time
and so that kind of uh i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so
now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how TEC would handle it they haven't pursued it you know
uh if there's some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines
and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative
so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know
uh-huh really
and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you've if it's something like that
uh-huh
[laughter]
you're kidding
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
the executives right [laughter]
[noise]
the executives
yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were
if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything
i can't believe i'd was so
brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but uh i i
well uh
i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i don't use drugs any more
uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines
um yes
uh-huh
and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad
really it's it's life is so much more enjoyable
uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know
i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing
uh-huh that's right
yeah
that's right
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh goodness
yeah
yeah
oh my gosh
yeah
uh-huh
right
well i would think they would be
but they weren't
isn't that awful
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah that's reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff
and i just you know went oh where [laughter]
let me move as far away as possible
yeah
but i'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and
they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know it's not smart so
so i guess it was just a generational thing
um-hum
that's right and that's good that's the best way to stop it
yeah
well i think we did it [laughter]
[laughter] it's good talking to you yeah bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[laughter] whoa [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
where do you work
oh
uh-huh
right do they do it like you know within hours of
the accident or is it
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah
yeah i think that's probably true too that's that's that's sort of scary
yeah
yeah [laughter] yeah really really
yeah that's that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should
i'm a TI employee and and and uh i'm i'm really gung ho for it in fact
i you know some of the places now um like IBM don't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we we have designated smoking areas
but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really it well it's on the campus of the TI facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's m- it's a factory environment
and uh they they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and i think that's bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way
i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential
yeah
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and uh
[laughter] i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know
then finally the day we declared war was my time [laughter]
no [laughter] and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group [laughter]
right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they [noise] were going to do all them first
but uh-huh
which i thought was interesting
oh man yeah
ooh
yeah
uh-huh
what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind
wow
[laughter]
really
well it's really lucky that you got away from that cause that's
really
downward spiral
yeah yeah that's that's it
yeah
just life in general
yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it
plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share
but that are not endangering your life in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola
and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type
yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals
you know that's really that's really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know
on on a on a greater frequency than than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am
well you well you'd think so but uh
i don't know if they do it -til yet
because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at TI i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four
eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever
so that's scary
[laughter]
oh Lord [noise]
oh
yeah yeah should we move [laughter]
ooh
that's awful
uh-huh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah peer group is the other way now instead of
uh-huh that's
yeah that it really is
okay well i enjoyed tack- talking to you Cathy bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well [noise] i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done
and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown
it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color
[laughter] i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color
covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there're splotches
but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
oh lord
uh-huh
oh yeah
so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried
uh-huh
and it's not scratching your floor because it's so thick oh that's pretty good we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times we have two children
and they just [laughter]
they ruin [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
[laughter] it's just terrible what they do and then i have been coloring my hair and i'm real haphazard when i do it so i've got dye on my bathroom door
and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good
and then we have a two story we did the outside of it one summer that was horrendous i mean i i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that
but i dread that the next time
uh-huh
no i wouldn't think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet
oh we got to do that this summer we're dreading it
[laughter] it's like they're dark everything else is white
now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business
uh-huh
oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do
oh wha- what else can i tell you about painting oh i get it all in my hair too do you do that
spots in it
are you having to repair the walls at all
um that's smart
so where do you live
ca- i'm in Garland
could you try to call this weekend
to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down
you didn't
yeah
well i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a
surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting
it hurts your back and it hurts your arm
[noise]
yeah
but you're glad you're doing it right
uh-huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards
on your baseboards
you don't have any carpet down in your house
see we've got carpet and
i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it
you can't hold it there until it's dried
uh-huh
okay
yeah
uh-huh i see
yeah
yeah yeah that's for sure
well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting process
so uh
the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh
kind of a a light peach color with uh and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white
and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i've attacked [laughter] and it's it's been uh
it's been something else [laughter] to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh
uh well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath
and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see [laughter] it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint
[laughter] every time the sun would come up in the morning i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh we've learned we're we uh
we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway and and we're in the middle of the bathroom now but uh it's it's been quite an adventure
the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and uh
we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up
well it's it's not too bad it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it's really not to bad to get off it it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it it it uh comes off with like a
a mild abrasive pad like a Scotchbrite pad or something like that and wa- and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on that
no not really
but
okay yeah
[laughter]
yeah
oh gosh
yeah yeah probably so
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah i
we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time but i've
i i grew up on a farm so i i've i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it
took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house
[laughter]
uh a little bit yeah yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now
yeah yeah absolutely [laughter] yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh
we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't
buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm alway- i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match
but uh it's gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while
i'm not overly proud of it but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that
and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like like uh i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match
they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time
and i i'm always doing all this other stuff and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that
so uh it it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere
yeah
yeah it sure makes a difference
[laughter]
yeah
yeah it's it's been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just
it really hadn't been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isn't enough time i i've
i find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but uh
i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else so that you could [laughter] once you get done you can always start over and and you can make up all kinds of excuses so uh
uh not a whole lot it they're they're in pretty good condition um
as as far as uh major repairs you know lo- a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh
i guess i- i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they um for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and i i didn't like that very well so i i moved that but uh
most of it most of it's in pretty good shape
uh live in Dallas
okay okay
uh
no no i haven't uh i hadn't tried in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend so uh i was pretty tied up
but
uh-huh
no that uh that's
yeah you know it i get a so- i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences
oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say th- the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much uh
i you know i i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know ev- every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and
you know o- [laughter] the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things
yeah yeah we do it uh
it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's
i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh
yeah yeah they [vocalized-noise]
no there's no carpet in the house right now
um -kay
well you know um
yeah i i've [vocalized-noise] i've seen uh they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths
and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put
well i'm not i'm not sure what what the people of Puerto Rico feel uh how do you feel about uh the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state
yeah well i question whether it's in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth
and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country
uh they do not have any voting privileges though and i don't believe they have any representation in Congress
yeah i don't believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh
uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh priv- privileges like that
i'm not sure how much that uh carries on
[laughter] yeah [laughter]
well i think we've got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish i'm not sure how fluent they are in English
and that's one of the major problems i i see with uh
other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we don't have a common language with them
right i think we'd have the same type of problem say with Mexico
uh Canada on the other hand uh English is one of their national languages they have
yeah uh-huh
so i think they're
yeah
i just see a lot of uh social and cultural differences that could uh pose problems with uh Puerto Rico becoming a state
um
i don't think they're strong enough myself to become independent
uh i think that it's in their best interest right now just uh to remain as is
keep the status quo and uh keep uh stay under the U- United States protection
yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh
military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing
uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth
uh
i don't see it in the near future
[laughter]
yeah well i've never been there i'm not quite familiar with with uh the way they do things
uh-huh
yeah oh i think that you know part of the biggest problem there is that they still really are third world country
and they haven't uh caught up uh economically with uh say the United States
uh-huh
okay
well did you have guides from the area or escorts or uh
okay
okay
right
yeah well they've got that Latin blood they get fired up about every little thing anyway
i think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of uh attaining a fifty first state is what would we do about our flag how do you arrange fifty one stars
[laughter]
what kind of pattern does do we come up with for that
could have a contest
[laughter]
well that would give them them more of an interest in what goes on in this country
if if they had uh uh a a uh a privilege of voting
uh that would give them a vested interest in the government and uh
i would see that as as a positive uh thing for them to consider
probably
uh yeah i really don't see any change in the near future
[laughter]
well Cuba's closer but uh
right
that is a good distance
what is their major industry
is it uh i i believe is it sugar cane or i'm not su- sure exactly what they do
right okay
yeah i'm not very familiar with with the the state of their a- agriculture
right you have to question
have to wonder how much tillable land they have uh being an island
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah i know they must have a lot of tourism too but i don't see as much advertising there as you do in the Baha- the say the Bahamas
with uh say uh uh Saint Thomas uh Virgin Islands uh places like that
right well the Virgin Islands are an American territory
and but you see a lot of advertising for that uh as far as uh vacation uh cruises and re-
okay so i guess um
i start with maybe if if does do you know if the population favors statehood or
what are we you were supposed to whether we favor it
well see i have mixed feelings because um it it the with the financial situation i don't really quite understand what would happen there if they would be a burden to us
or if they already are a burden
so i i really
what uh i really don't care you know i mean
yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders
but like getting back to the their government benefits
they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits
yeah so um also of course they they can they join the they can always join the military service they are considered citizens i believe
yeah they can
yeah that's a strange situation you you're a citizen yet you can't vote
s- so if
yes i went i worked um i went there for a class in a factory
and some of the people in my class couldn't speak fluent English they had a very difficult time with it and they and they couldn't [noise] the ones that could speak
speak it had a really hard time reading it so
yes as well as the the um [noise]
the Quebec people that that speak French
and they're s-
[laughter]
they're supposed to be bilingual
but um
yes what do you what do you um do you do you think they should become independent maybe or do you think they should [vocalized-noise] benefit
yeah i think if i was a middle class Puerto Rican maybe that that would be the um stablest thing to do
they would
yes
so they've been talking about this for a long time do you think they're going to ever vote
whether they want one one of the three choices
i know because i think i've been rea- i read this ten years ago that they were having these big uh
um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would s- down the statehood
it's it down there if you're um familiar with their politics
they uh
it's very uh i- i don't know it's called Latino there they have loudspeakers on their cars and they run down the neighborhood saying vote for you know Pierre he's or uh Pe- uh
Pedro he's the best i- it's really kind of comical
yeah these these people they have the big loudspeakers because they have uh
democratic system just like ours where they elect their mayors and their councilmens it's really kind of funny it's it's kind of an invasion of your p- privacy too they're going down these streets with these really loud speakers
yeah there there's some really poor areas where when i went [noise] uh
it it looked like it was it was always
you couldn't if you didn't know the area they they didn't advise you to go out and uh you know go in the the uh poorer sections of town
but the the big cities where the uh big hotels were
tha- that was that was safe ground to walk around but uh particularly in San Juan we wanted to go walk on the beach at night and they looked at us like we were crazy
says no you can't go at night because uh
we were we our business was on the other side of the island we were only in San Juan it was at night
they don't want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous
um actually we um m- met some people that were in the naval base down there
and uh they didn't particularly like living down there because it was very foreign very different the the people
they they didn't treat them nice they you know um so i think there i what i learned from them there was a lot of resentment towards the Americans
so and it was like they were they're Puerto Rican and were Americans
so that's why they're so um emotional about about statehood yet like you say it's
they can't really support themselves so
yeah that's very true
[laughter]
i don't know that that's a good one
[laughter]
yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is
they don't make decision they don't vote i i think if they voted th- that as you say the um
they they would probably stay commonwealth or that would be the best for them
yeah
but as you say it's two di- two different cultures
i don't i don't know
um so uh you like i say i was reading this ten years ago whether they could they're going to be talking about this in another ten years
i don't see them doing anything
so
i don't know and it's also a long way away
[laughter]
if you know if it was Cuba
yes Cuba's really close [vocalized-noise] but uh Puerto Rica is uh is it's like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida it's another
another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean
but uh
yeah and they have to they have to import a lot of their um
cereals and things a- and i don't understand now why they don't have a processing i guess
i- i uh they it's just as easy to bring the uh cereal in boxes as it is to bring it in in you know bulk grain and produce it there
uh i really don't know um
it could be i'm sure they rely heavily on tourism and even [vocalized-noise] the all the American companies down there with their uh electronics industries and pharmaceuticals are big down there
that's one thing i did notice uh pharmaceuticals electronics tha- makes up i mean enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business
but um i really don't know agriculturally they could have so much and they and they don't they don't seem to uh i don't know if i heard they don't feed themselves or not i don't think they support themselves
agriculturally i found that to be really odd
you know well they see they can't grow the grains i mean they're if the i guess their grains don't do well in the tropics
so like you say they gr- grow sugar beets and sugar cane and that's all export
well yeah that is it's mountainous and uh but it [noise]
it looks fertile and it it um i mean it rains enough they have the climate and the rain
and if not it's like i've been to Saint Thomas and it just starts from the ocean up
and i- and it's very it's like one big rock but uh Puerto Rico has lots of uh
lots of uh mountainous region and coastal regions
yeah i don't know uh i i-
that's very true i don't know if they just
take it for granted that they you know it's an American commonwealth they really don't have to advertise that much but that is an interesting point
but i i believe it's a very popular vacation destination
yep
okay okay
um yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin
[vocalized-noise] okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for Saturday i'll tell you what i'm going to have um
i can find it well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue
and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin i was going to make some uh like
fish chunks and dip it in the fondue i don't know if it will come out
yeah the cheese fondue i make some people like Swiss um i prefer cheddar and i'll mix i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because
[vocalized-noise] for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar and then i was going to make other things like potato skins
it see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable
oh yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party
uh
yeah instead of something greasy or
uh uh no um my uh
girlfriend's do catering and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray i think they try and suggest it
what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry
even banana if you can do it just before you leave it stays nice and fresh
yeah
yeah i like those [laughter] um they they made a couple of those uh they made one for my uh bridal shower and i was pretty pleased i never made one for myself though but they look easy enough to make it's not
yeah
yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
yeah um something i do is a fruit is i'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them
yeah i have two nieces and they they [vocalized-noise] come over to my house they go melt some chocolate chips [laughter] go buy me some strawberries [laughter]
yeah they're you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry
huh yeah no they um the strawberries are coming in season now from they're they're coming up from Florida of course i live in Vermont so
but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from Florida so
yeah
yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from South America
yep they a lot of um oh of uh winter produce comes from South America of course their seasons are switched
so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want [laughter] um it filled
a lot of people try to stay away from this but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding yeah it and it if you if you um well first of all i star-
take about a quarter and a half of milk and i put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat
[vocalized-noise] and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning
i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender
it it makes the uh it makes uh [noise] a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough it's uh i don't know they're called moogoo leaves or something [vocalized-noise] they're
yeah they're real neat i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one i got the Black and Decker kind but uh
it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but
i don't think it pure i don't think it gets it good enough and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar
and i let it pretty much i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little
i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in and it's the the trick is is to have this blender
so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes
seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off
and when it cools a little they you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes French vanilla um custard
yeah
a chocolate powder yeah that cocoa yeah the unsweetened it comes in like a real dark can our mothers used to use it and then
yeah we all used to yeah it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestle Quik i suppose you could use that i- yeah but um
i-
well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red [laughter] and i'm like oh this is kind of groedy
um no actually i found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks i mean something she had collected out of Woman's Day or something
so
i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um
yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the cornstarch
um yeah right in the in the lukewarm milk sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch
and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top
yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I
pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so
yep and then you know if if y- you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more
because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this
because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real
package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less
but i put it in a nice glass bowl and um some people don't like that [noise] that film on the pudding so you can put uh Saran Wrap over the top
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on but um
yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator
but um [vocalized-noise] i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah so that's why i do that
so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe [laughter]
what what is do you have a favorite recipe
oh
oh that's wonderful okay
that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or
right
yeah
oh that sounds good
that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's
oh definitely i think better even than than other kinds of food [laughter]
right exactly yeah
um-hum
oh
yes
right
right that's true or even have you ever seen where they they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat i beat yep
oh i think it would it would be a lot of work but um you know because it's you know you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baler and stuff but but i think they're really neat and you know i think they're worth the time
because they
oh yeah [laughter]
right yeah
[laughter] is that is that good you know i've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate but i've never tried it are they really good
oh i bet it doesn't mix well does it
oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately [laughter] because they weren't in season of course they had to be be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in [vocalized-noise]
oh is that right
oh i guess i didn't really
uh-huh right
well
okay sure su-
is that right i've never heard of that
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think i know what you're talk- is it like a hand held thi- yeah okay
[noise]
uh-huh
oh huh
huh
uh-huh
oh wow that is really interesting are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened unsweetened
yeah
right i have some [laughter] i just want
right okay cooking chocolate
that's really interesting i've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat
well how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own
is that right
oh neat that is just really neat because i
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good
uh-huh
so you put the milk in the cornstarch
and then put that back in the saucepan
huh that's
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
do you do you put it in the refrigerator then or you
uh-huh
right that's true i knew that yeah yeah
[laughter]
well Bo was uh playing football actually you know he plays both football and base- and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip
and there's been arthritis and he's been out for a number of of sea- games and it just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent
so they're saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury
so they had uh they're having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike
uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors
and since that makes him more money anyhow [laughter]
yeah he does it it's pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore
i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever
on the same program they had Michael Jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the Chicago Bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing McDonald's and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike
and then of course he's got uh Wheaties also
[laughter]
and that's that's in a year
that's uh what would you do with all that money
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah i could make that go a lot of places
[laughter]
it's amazing anymore there's a also a program on this evening about the
a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics
uh-huh
yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature
i guess anymore it's just a big business
uh-huh
i think it al- probably also m- is more as you get into the the big schools
the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools they're all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
they actually mentioned a little on the fact that he's started to instigate a program where he's actually uh not necessary they say he's getting around the rules somewhat but it's actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other
students who don't meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position
and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then then to junior college
so at least that's uh some way that they're
you know i- i guess the best part about it you can't just drop off all schol- scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in it's intentions help a lot of people who couldn't afford to go to school
but that seemed like it was actually uh you know if there's a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way
well uh at least it's hopefully still helping the the student
you're not uh going to graduate somebody who still can't read and write
that's way too much yes it has
[laughter]
yeah but that's quite all right i think they just want to have some kind of normal conversation
[laughter]
does it
really well there's been uh actually some pretty interesting interesting topics that i've had i've had things from uh tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three i've participated in
uh-huh
well heck you
uh-huh
wow sounds like you participated quite a bit
uh-huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split
is it well that's good
um-hum
well that's good well it's been enjoyable speaking with you
all righty good-bye
[noise]
oh no i hadn't heard about Bo Jackson though what happened
yeah plays for the Raiders
uh i didn't know that
well
yeah it does he has more money out of the uh ads than he does the game itself
i well i think uh Joe Montana got something like a million dollars for saying i'm going to Disneyland
outrageous prices
yeah [laughter]
uh i- i wouldn't know what to do with it
we just discussing what we'd do with five thousand
[laughter]
uh the uh
achievement for the let's see how are they putting that uh the school let's see the academic repo- board review board uh the dean's being it more involved with the athletes
yeah i was watching that
yeah well uh
some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them though they do it just for the love of it
uh
well that's not necessarily true though you know uh
i'm an avid uh basketball fan of Bull
and i know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits
or you know and so you know he's doing it because he wants to
yeah i heard about that i haven't heard much about it though
yeah
you don't thin- yeah i don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though [laughter]
yeah -t's yeah it's helping the kids
uh it's happened too much
yeah well we veered from the subject [laughter]
i hope so
[laughter]
it's happened to me more than once
yeah almost all the time
i haven't had anything on fishing i've had uh
oh arts and crafts uh football basketball and baseball
child rearing or child day care
and couple other things i can't remember
yeah well almost everyday the [vocalized-noise] the lines are open
uh half-and-half
oh you know uh i had to start out doing it i done it about five times and then uh here lately they i've been letting them catch me
all right well you take it easy bye
[noise]
oh go ahead i- i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was
uh
uh well there there's two things uh
the one i'm interested the most i guess myself uh
would be the the Freons i mean for air cond- the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad
yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be
no i heard about it though
was that before i didn't see it was that before they actually did that or it was w-
because of that you know
right
are you d- you don't work at TI
oh okay
where do you work in research or
oh okay
no okay yeah
yeah
uh well i'm kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh
i- i'll do that in a minute i- i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage
you know not not using
no no no
really oh i'm a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day uh
uh
i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane i don't think you'll have any trouble
oh yeah yeah
no i- i think uh i uh work on my own cars and uh
i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline
uh oh ye- i- the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was
what did you see the advertisements uh
when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that
i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know
did you see any of those uh i it was
it must have been channel thirteen i don't recall although i thought it was on CNN oh i
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it c- i saw it regularly
and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh
how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know
oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh
yeah
uh it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know
yeah oh yeah well i live in Arlington and there there there are no buses i mean there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so
well i know it it's uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh
you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say
have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know
because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car
no no you're right i- i have seen them but uh they have a battery car
uh i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it
and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that
yeah i- i think uh there could be a lot of peo- i thi- people close this is really we're
were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think
yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the SE building too which is uh but it's a solar
uh it's for uh they g- got some money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever
no i'm actually in the south building but uh
i was uh i'm the facility so i've been in all most of the buildings anyway
oh yeah well the the solar area is right
right around from the auditorium now
and they they've got several different uh areas where they're called solar lab
it's right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there
yeah but the solar project you know TI's been into it for years and i guess it's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels
yeah
i've seen some i think then again i'm surprised now i didn't think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show
there was nothing uh and there was no [vocalized-noise] place for
air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles
there
hum
i didn't see did you go
oh
i- i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they're they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh
very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old V8s they're all brand new engines uh of course they're burning gasoline of course
now and uh
whether you know that's one way you know uh
uh f- on air pollution i- i- i don't know if the automobiles are are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have
gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they
the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that i mean if you're you're you're knowledgeable on that
oh well i'm not an expert i just had a little i've i've seen a little pollution in my time it's uh
the the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a [vocalized-noise] repellent and uh that was really quite dangerous i'm not certain that that was
that's that's really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is is uh
is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease
well the you know that that's another arguable issue and i i've seen the uh uh uh assuming you can buy into global warming i [vocalized-noise]
well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those uh all th-
uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit
yes and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer
which actually happened it it ac- yes it actually happened uh
it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was or [vocalized-noise] which is the national
anyway research people and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough
and it's it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but
th- th- th- the the the [vocalized-noise] the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh i'm uh member of the American Meteorological Society and
yeah i do
but i'm uh i on- i do that in my formalize
no i'm a planner a production planner
but i- i i'm in the active reserves as a weatherman so
uh i- i keep up from time to time but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is
but um if there is
uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and m- stuff on cars
well do you have an older car
i ha- [laughter] i have been working on an older car but it to yeah
well i'm restoring one [laughter]
i'm not having any problem it's a seventy
and uh
but did you have another ques- you said you had another question
yeah
no i didn't see that that i know that the uh that's
well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose that's that's the ultimate uh pollution problem
well
well it's interesting that the the Chernobyl accident uh actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went
um covered
a a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i- i think it's drawn in uh i think
gets in there because i can't think of the other trace but i saw a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but i- i- i guess
i can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains
that that's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and
but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution
well it that's the thing is that i think i think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel
burning fuel the problem is is it's like Los Angeles people don't people don't want to use mass transit so
but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus
well my boss drives forty miles one way each day
and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles
and and they don't think it well i guess they do think something of it but
um not enough to
you know you consider how much um
but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the
out of downtown so we get away from the the smog my my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley
before Los Angeles uh wh- when the valley was clean
and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and
yes yes
well do you know
General Motors apparently has one that they're they're testing i think it's
no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing almost
but they
suppose
huh well the Road and Track was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh they apparently think they're close
well th- there's still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this
there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research
yeah well do you work in that C building
oh well i'm at
oh well i'm in i'm in the C building been there for all my life
huh
well that's been a [vocalized-noise] i know the focal plain array is they were taking space to for a long time
well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon
you know
who wants to yeah i mean we want to not pollute but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from [vocalized-noise]
well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol
they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but i- wa- it was showing they i mean uh
an article
no i didn't i didn't go so i wish
they've done a lot
well there
well they uh it's interesting though because my cars are older and so i didn't have to if you live in Dallas County
you have to have your have to have it checked and it's great i had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of trouble getting that pinned and so apparently
[noise]
well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports
and uh but when i got married [laughter] and had children and everything it seems like i keep all my activity just chasing around
fulfilling my obligations so i haven't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose what about you
oh really
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter] oh no that can be awful
uh-huh
oh that's good
uh-huh
do you work out on like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh i bet
um-hum
um-hum
hum
[laughter]
doesn't sound like low impact [laughter]
well
well that's good
so are you moti-
well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise
but i like to um [noise]
play tennis and play racquetball i- i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in uh the shape that i was satisfied with at least
And uh then i have given that up but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself i don't feel
good and i get you know when you get out of shape and you don't if you're easily tired
and so that has made me but i i'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out i just if something like uh [noise]
i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed
and i wouldn't enjoy it but if i have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun playing and then you then you get some of the
um good exercise and some of the desired results but you you're doing it for fun
but i really admire people who can go and work out and
um-hum
uh-huh
well that's nice
um-hum
yes
it is kind
it is family and it's fun it's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and
and all and also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation
you know like a sauna or [laughter]
you know uh hot jacuzzis or whatever they have that kind of is kind of makes it fun and stuff you know you can relax that way afterwards and things
but well i guess it's getting late
and i should take off but uh i appreciate that that helped me helped motivate me [laughter]
think someone can do it [laughter] maybe i should start thinking about it again
well
yeah i bought one i went to the i bought the low impact first i thought shouldn't out of the blue just jump in
so but i haven't done it but i'm going to try it well you have a good night we'll see you bye-bye
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh well [laughter] it's funny this week yesterday i started exercising seriously
this weekend i cleaned out my closets and uh [noise] a couple years ago i too got married i haven't have any children yet but this weekend i cleaned out some closets and i found a bathing suit that i had bought
[laughter] tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me
so yesterday i went to uh a spa i belong to a private spa and went in and and got with a trainer
and uh he checked body fat content and we set up a program for me to work on and i went back tonight also
so i've been two nights in a row and i i'm going to take it pretty seriously i'm going to start going every night just you know even if i- i like tonight i only went for thirty minutes but i at least did something
last night i did [noise] about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips
and then i did a hour of aerobics
and that was really tough [laughter]
and i was sore this morning when i got up but then tonight i got into a a it's sort of like an aerobics class
but it's only thirty minutes and it's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt
so and that was thirty minutes was definitely plenty [laughter]
so
no it was a lot of sweat but
i've been trying to eat correctly also
so have you started exercising at home or
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah
well i don't you know a lot of people i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it and she walks around talks to people and and
i don't really get into that naturally i'm married so my husband goes a lot and we'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave
but yeah and swimming is a is a part that i i'd like to get into as far as my you know just aerobic activity
they say that swimming is real good so i'd like to try that as well and that's probably something that that you could do you know family included
um-hum
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah i agree
yeah
okay
yeah
well try it or or maybe just exercise at home i bought a tape and i'm going to try doing that
uh-huh
yeah that's me
um-hum
thanks a lot bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i have noticed a lot uh more women's roles at work which i like in management
which that's good i- i guess to have a woman's
viewpoints and uh
in a way things are handled at work especially in personnel type jobs
which i think
is probably better on the hand of women for uh
any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that
women probably understand that better than the men do so i think that's good
[laughter]
yeah
i think
[laughter]
i think that that's a good benefit i think having women
uh in in higher up positions stuff like that
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
right
and how to treat them [laughter]
right right and who wants to be treated which way
[laughter]
yeah
right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure
right
[laughter]
they couldn't do anything about it
right right
[laughter]
that's exactly right they can just watch it
i think it's uh i think if they want to do it
you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it
that's right and i don't
right that's exactly right now they're trained and everything so [noise] let them do it if they want to that's that's the way it is in a lot of jobs you know like the firemen
you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be firemen policemen
and stuff like that now they get to be all that
right
that's exact- and i feel the sa- exact same way i don't think that's right
right you're uh you know it's the best person qualified i think and and that's the way it ought to be but it's as we know it's not
right
exactly same with a doctor in a hospital
[laughter]
that's right
she got that scholarship
right they need to give the scholarship to a woman that's true that's true with any case i hate that but but that is true but
right
it's yeah eth- any ethnic problem or race
um-hum don't want to hurt anybody's feelings and get everybody covered
um-hum
um-hum and now everything's his you know uh his and her and everything you have to you always have to say it like that you can never say
you know his you know and that never has offended me when you know when someone's talking and they say you know
his job or something like that or
that's never
i mean i understand that they're talking about the job [laughter] not the person in the job that's that's always
that's always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it
but
yeah she is she [vocalized-noise] i
i don't know i- i can't say that
that i- i well i can't say that i did or didn't vote for her because i didn't get to vote this time but
i don't know that i'm i guess i'm ready just hard to see a woman in such a
i guess powerful position
right right
right
i know that's true and
right inexperience also that's something that bothers me is uh even though she is you know the treasurer forever it bothers me that i don't know that she doesn't have
that much background i guess in
well it's hard to say i don't know something about it just just kind of bothers me
yeah she i mean she seems on the outside
uh good and everything but
but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having i'm not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models
you're just always used to men i mean that's just something that men always did
right
that's exactly right and
probably yeah and in Dallas you know we had the uh
Annette Strauss and she's a
uh first woman mayor so
do they
i didn't know that
oh does she really
oh Lord
[laughter]
[laughter] big combination of both
she's got covered all the bases didn't she
yeah
right
that's really good i guess
right
yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that
you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that
so that's going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just
yeah exactly and that's
that's
that's sad to say
that that that that's true though
so
um-hum
right right
i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here
yeah [laughter]
yeah
yeah yeah
that's right
that was a good that was a good leadership
that women
that's what they say that's true
[laughter]
[laughter] that's true well i hope
you know that they
whatever these leaders of ours do that everything's for the good that just like like you said it's with man or a woman it sh- however they're going to be able to uh take care of us
i don't know
yeah i do know though in our company we don't have a lot of
upper
upper management wom- i mean we rarely have any women that are upper management
i don't know
[noise]
i don't know that's really that's really well it's it's so uh
i guess we're we're kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of men always did the you know the engineering and all this and the technology and men are so i'm i'm sure that's has a lot to do with it
right right
[noise]
that's right that's exactly right
so but a lot of more women are starting their own businesses i've noticed than
and that's that's pretty interesting
oh does she that's pretty interesting
yeah there's a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarell- or a cheese company can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i- i just think God if only it could be me [laughter]
all right well what do you think about women's role's in the last generation what uh what changes have you seen
well yeah yeah i would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than men [laughter]
we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings
well i've noticed that it seems uh some women are i guess what i call the feministus
you know or you know very
strong uh you know women's libbers and others that don't want to be and it's it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know
yeah
i think they should all wear signs you know or something
but uh
i- i- i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background
the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not
[vocalized-noise] i can't figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go
if you can stay out of it although i guess
although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go
now it's kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now it's it's i'm happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don't have to go
i always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over to the Gulf and let her fight but
well they couldn't be worse than some of the men
i think it all depends on mental set more than sex
well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it
but i do object to you know someone hiring a woman just because they have to meet their quota
that's
that's really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it
yeah i- i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know
the right sex rather than qualifications
yeah that's true i hate to [vocalized-noise] hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female
you know
or a Black woman named Rodriguez
well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate
much with
whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now
or with uh anyth- ethnic problems uh i think so- society tends to overcompensate and we go we sw- we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in
oh that's true oh yeah
God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know
hey sweetie or something
right a wait person
what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female
i think i'm more scared of her not because she's a female but because more for her po- [vocalized-noise] her political beliefs and what she says she's going to do i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position
although you see more and more uh
more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics
and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector
i think her background totally bothers me
that could be yeah
yeah the governor was you know the governor he did this
and now we got the governor she's going to do that
wonder what they'll call if she was married and wonder if they'll refer to him as the first husband
oh yeah Houston got a female mayor
yeah
she oh yeah she's a she's a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district
oh yeah
so i think you know i- i'm not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or be- or because she supported the gays i really don't know because a large you know there's a large population down there of gays
yeah
yeah she seems to be interesting i- i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Leland's wife is
taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female mayor in Dallas one in Houston we got a female governor and there's two or three more governors in in the in the state that are females
and there's quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them you know i would i- i- i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards
yeah but i think we're bred that way you know i think i think it's part of the
of the of the male mystique
and uh
course the reason yeah i think it's going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here
in the southern states than it will be up
in the more liberal east and west coast
this is you know
we don't have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the
the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road
and of course that's changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the women you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD
the greatest force in America is mothers
if you could mobilize the mothers you got them
yeah
just depends on who's going to exploit us when
is that because they're just not uh you just don't have any women that are there or no one has
ascended to that level yet
i've noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well there's no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there
just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn't automatically mean y- it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that part
yeah
we have several here in Austin that have uh
i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture
uh place she builds library furniture
and she
and she's ta- she's taking over and it's uh it's it's a million dollar a year company and she's having a ball doing it
yeah
yeah
i've got several uh matter fact i have some friends that own machine shops and they have several
[noise]
okay Art you say you own a TI or you own a uh an IBM compatible
uh-huh
oh you're in school
uh-huh
wha- what do you use to to download into the system can you p- hook up a a floppy to it
oh it's built in
oh that's pretty good um
um
uh-huh
uh [noise] i do i do uh word processing on it primarily uh the main reason why i'm i'm hanging on to it is because of the business that i'm in the the home computer business i have a
a store in my house where i've got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system
if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product
uh oddly enough no uh because i do different things with it at home i i do mostly play and at work i do mostly work uh it's [laughter] you know you you you can put a game on an IBM compatible computer uh but uh
you know i i don't normally do that at at work uh and i i typically deal with uh
Lotus uh WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet
and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas
and the mainframe has a lot of uh software out there where i use to
interface my computer with
no um
there was at one point in time where where it was continually down it it appears at though whenever i wanted to use it it wasn't working and this was about
seven ten years ago
and they made a dramatic effort of trying to reduce down time down to nothing and today uh i can't say that i can remember the last time it went down uh several months it's it's just up all the time now
they take it down like on Sunday nights like for a couple of hours to do maintenance or whatever but uh unless there's something dramatic that happens with the telephone system uh usually doesn't break down and i think what they're doing is they're using satellite somehow
to uh to transmit the signals to have a backup some to back that that system up so that there is no no down time
analysis [laughter] i don't i don't know how they fixed the problem but they're uh you know the whole theme of of what they were doing was was to measure and record and and uh reduce down time
and the other big thing is uh
quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction
how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes and that's that's uh that's where they they were heading and
uh the system is fantastic so it's it's not slow if anything the the PC is now slower than the mainframe
[vocalized-noise] we're transmitting from from uh New England to Dallas Texas and i'm getting responses in in split seconds
yeah
oh well that that's another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro
and use the mainframe for
corporation uh type programs like payroll and uh financial data bases and we also have uh
uh a message system
which is a worldwide network within within the corporation
where i can send telegrams to any TI site
and they've also hooked up to some company to allow us to do E-mail and allow it to convert it
to other companies so that th- other companies can recognize our E-mail and now we're getting into faxes as well
right off the PC
yeah that's uh the technology is really [laughter] really blow you know going going crazy with this
uh originally i didn't think it was i thought that what ended you know we ended up doing was uh doing all of the secretarial work and the secretaries had nothing to do
uh and and that i guess part of that is true [laughter] uh i do all my own typing i i i don't give anymore uh paper to the secretary to type up only because it takes me longer to write it
and redo it and then give it back to her again than it does for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it
and uh i i do everything i do my only typing do my own foils uh it's just you know it's just so much easier for me to do that
uh-huh
yeah and
the the files may be disappearing but the secretaries are not the the people people in power are are afraid to give up that status symbol
and uh although what they're doing now is is they're maintaining secretaries but they're piling more and more people onto that one secretary rather than get rid of the secretary [laughter] they're they're just you know they're finding justification by adding more people to her
well i don't know like back in in my particular office there must be at least uh twenty twenty five people one secretary no typewriter it's all computers everybody's got a a PC sitting in front of their desk
oh uh i i have a laser printer i have access to a laser printer in my office but i don't have one tied in to my system yet uh i'm i'm networked into it but it's so inconvenient for me to to
to run all the way downstairs that [laughter] that i don't use it
yeah
well i think what i see is a different direction i don't know if you are you familiar with uh programs like Harvard Graphics where they have uh
uh like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor
and and transmit it just like a view foil
so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have
um
the the mainframe as being the monitor in other words if you've got foils you pull it out of the mainframe and then use the telephone speaker system to communicate with
and and we use uh
we do teleconferencing that way
so that that everybody's looking at the same foil because we're pulling it off the network
oh yeah i can remember at one time the the uh
secretaries actually had to be artists and [laughter] and technicians and today uh with the laser printer
they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and it's it's so easy to do uh
with the with the programs that are out there now
all right okay
i believe we have
okay nice talking to you
take it easy
[noise]
[noise]
uh yeah i have one of these little Zenith laptops which uh the uh everybody here at school has to buy one
and
oh yeah i'm a student uh at
at Harvard Business School
and uh
tremendously useful thing it's uh the the portability and the compactness of it are uh pretty nice it's uh you know enough that you can kind of throw it in a briefcase or uh slap it over your shoulder and carry it around
uh it's got an internal three and a half inch floppy
yeah and uh it also has a forty megabyte hard drive built in
and uh you know the batteries carry it for at least four or five hours
and so
you know i use it um
both in school
to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we're studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well
i'm i'm curious what you use your uh your home computer for
uh-huh
uh-huh
does it does it cause a problem for you to use a different computer at work than you use at home
uh-huh
yeah
[noise]
right
uh-huh
are are you at the point where the the mainframe appears slow to you relative to your personal computer given the the ratio
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's
um-hum
you you don't think that they went and did a uh what is it an Ishihara uh quality analysis
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
that
that's tremendous are are your computers at work net uh networked at all or is that
um-hum
uh-huh
huh
that's tremendous
it's clearly a uh
a uh
productivity enhancement
uh device and allows you to do
[noise]
that that's been my experience also i've actually i guess i've been doing that since probably when i was in high school
many years ago and uh
uh it it it's gotten to the point now i think where the uh secretaries are are finding other jobs to do because you know the typing and to some extent the filing is just not there anymore
big paper files are disappearing
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
i guess there's there's a fear that one day if the computers ever stopped working
there'd be a bunch of people staring at the typewriter with no idea what to do with it
huh
do you uh if if i assume you all are networked to a a variety of of laser printers
uh-huh
huh because what i was what i was going to ask you is it seems like the next big jump will come with color printing you were talking about doing your own presentation and foils it would seem that color capability would be the next big sort of leap in presentation
yeah
right
huh
a
wow
interesting
yeah that's uh
that's uh
pretty powerful
set of tools to give to people who traditionally have had to go through a whole production process just to get the [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
[noise]
huh
well uh Frank i think i kind of need to get back to some other things so i i hope we've talked uh
covered enough of of this for for what this is all about
yeah it was a pleasure
thank you
bye
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
we've my husband's retired and we vacationed a lot and i think i've had a lot in the meantime i'm not sure i would have picked that one either [laughter] shall we have a go at it
[laughter] [noise]
um
i think one of the facets of living in a small town is that often times
you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family
i would think so
yes i have
i did t- yes
um
uh the last trial i sat on
at the end of the session the prosecuting attorney called us into a private room
and more or less instructed us to find her not guilty because even though they knew
and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever
which we did find her guilty against his instruction and she did flee the state
but [laughter]
but she was guilty and
we just didn't understand why he was doing that
my husband sat in on a jury trial a murder trial that lasted for two weeks
that left him uh i mean in the very beginning he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh
guilty uh
which surprised me that that uh through the jury discussion they were able to convince him
against his original opinion so maybe that speaks well for juries
that doesn't seem fair does it
uh-huh
uh-huh
the only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in uh Chicago where so many judges were
guilty of so much misjustice from the bench
that after all they're
only people too in that
they're subject to corruption just like any other human being and they do have a lot of power
maybe we both agree then that we need to keep juries and
i think so [laughter]
i think we've reached a decision [laughter] nice visiting with you [laughter] bye
[noise]
uh-huh
sure
okay trial by jury
uh-huh
so that might lead you to a biased uh decision perhaps if you were uh-huh
on the other hand um i don't know if course the judge as all the expertise in that field and he's trained for that and and i'm sure there are certain
rules that are set down that he goes by uh along the way to make a decision
but
perhaps the jury can um
give their uh input as to what they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there
uh have you ever sat on a jury trial
yeah i have too and i found it real interesting but
but we weren't given any opportunity to make a decision as to what would happen we just said whether or not we thought the party was guilty
and he took it from there
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh that would merely make for some
odd behavior on the on their part
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i i remember the one that i sat in on we had quite a problem coming to a conclusion and and we came back with so many people this way and so many that way and the judge told us we couldn't leave until we
came to a decision and we just could not we were split and he kept us there one evening until seven
uh and everyone wanted to go home and so they were willing some of them were willing to change their uh decision just to get out of uh out of the jury room
no and i i couldn't believe they would do that so maybe in a way it should be left up to the judge because uh maybe the jury isn't
uh going to give them an honest decision
you know i i don't know i guess if if we had more power
we're just people off the street so to speak and
we don't have the uh background to maybe make that decision
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh it seems uh sometimes it seems uh rather
i guess rather uh odd that one person would have that deciding factor
he would be the sole factor uh determining a person's outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes
uh has a lot to decide has to decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case too
i think so
[laughter] we could go on
i think we have
thank you bye-bye

[noise]
the home that uh we bought back in the early eighties
was uh w- w- typical tract home and we were
uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but uh it's not too bad
some of the things that we didn't uh think about
when we bought it turned out uh
worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill
and some of our neighbors down the the lower part uh get their yards flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the
on the uh grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from
from the concrete uh the shopping center near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our neighbors so so that was a little thing that i'd never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way
uh another uh calamity i guess that befalls some purchasers that i didn't uh think about when i first purchased this house was
what can happen r- immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a street and a little little uh business area
and uh some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later a a uh shopping center built up behind them and it was a grocery store that had that stocked at night at about three am every night
they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldn't stand that noise
then oddly enough after that they uh uh i- it it closed down now that grocery store isn't there and hasn't been there for about six years now so
uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and
little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape
and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there there's not even a parking lot so it it's a nice uh two or three houses on either side of us is nice grass and trees and
and then across from that is a a major four lane street and then across from that is
is uh the parks of the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and trees and parks
and we really didn't didn't uh
i mean that wasn't our consideration wh- when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold
so it turned out to be pretty good and
Dallas
yeah it's uh it's a nice area as it were about the only two things that uh didn't work out too well for us well one of them's nice in in a way we're on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a
U shaped drive and we're the first house that they actually started turning
to make for a turn on a on a cul-de-s- not a cul-de-sac but a turn on a ninety degree turn on the street which meant that we're not jammed right up against our neighbor's house
there's there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways
so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the the ones down the street
but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so i- it was a bit of a drawback but uh it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass
and uh we did also end up in a in an area that we didn't we didn't realize when we bought it that uh the soil is that uh black clay and it
it tends to uh go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that uh most of these houses get no matter how much watering we do
so we have to contend with doors that sometimes sometimes the during the year don't uh
j- close just right and uh things of that nature
yeah that's true there are there is a little s- little segment up near McKinney and up near um
uh they said out near Wylie there's some
some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it
but there are some housing developments that uh the guy that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little little pockets of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all and had i only known you know maybe i'd have looked over there
uh what about your house
[laughter]
um-hum
it's true that there's always that chance i guess [laughter]
hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
nothing you can do
that's right there- nothing you can do
yeah we've got
[noise] we've got one that's done that uh we've been pretty fortunate most of our neighbors have had many more um
i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some
some uh name brand windows uh one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs and they have the the
different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them tilt in so you can clean them or and it's a real strange
mechanical beast but uh they haven't lost their seal yet so it's i guess there's a qua- some quality in it
so
um-hum
hum
goodness
yeah that's
that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad
it's true
goodness
yeah and it'd be nice to do it with with all the same kind too
hum
and those held
that's interesting i didn't know they could do that
yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it
it can fog up and not go away quickly enough
well i hear my kid calling me i better go see what he wants [noise] okay bye
[noise]
um-hum
[laughter]
uh
yeah
yeah
oh
oh no
[laughter]
oh good [laughter]
oh that's really nice
where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in Dall- uh Rowlett
uh-huh
oh that's really nice
oh [laughter]
yeah it probably will
yeah we have that
uh-huh
right i guess that's just Texas though you have to live with that
hum
uh-huh
[laughter] really
well we bought uh our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said it's out in Rowlett and it's it's real nice it's four bedroom and it's kind of a tract area too we've got people behind us and on both sides of us
i don't really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land [laughter]
but uh it's a it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess uh hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we
we bought when it was down a little bit but we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldn't sell for anywhere near what we've got into it so
it uh hopefully it'll turn around
sometime
yeah oh i think it will eventually out here they're building more new houses all the time though and people can go and buy a brand new one that's never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess that's what they would choose
but there uh w- as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and wa- moisture
gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now they've got so much
and the builder's gone bankrupt and the glass company's gone bankrupt so we don't really have any recourse and just hope they break or something [laughter]
yeah but other than that we haven't had any problems
um-hum
oh uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
w- we had um our insurance our home owner's insurance actually covered some of it because i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so
they replaced like seven of them
and we just had to pay the deductible but
they wouldn't that insurance company went out of business in Texas because they had so many claims that they couldn't make a profit and so now none of the other insurance companies will will consider covering that
which i can understand it's really not
damaged
oh yeah
but i bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad
just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced
yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in
that's over a year ago and it's it hasn't had any problems yeah seemed to
somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the foundation puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open
right
[laughter]
okay well it was good talking to you [laughter] bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay we're rolling
i uh what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy what would you say
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum um-hum um-hum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh
how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
well i sort of one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working
uh you know it's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt
uh i couldn't you you couldn't do it otherwise
yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt
it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund
they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the [laughter] job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy
um-hum
really
huh
yes yes i know i was actually i th- i was thinking of trying to get a job there i heard of it
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
yeah yeah
well my my real feeling about
about the purpose of undergraduate education is
it's really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it
but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults
i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to
be fostered in as you become
you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society
and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them
yeah and want to develop that
um-hum
um-hum um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
the same patterns of behavior you mean yeah yeah
exactly it's kind i find it kind of sad i really do
um-hum
yeah right
um-hum um-hum yeah in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems
[laughter]
yeah the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of th- thirty thousand students
[vocalized-noise] and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're
they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they
they i don't see them getting
i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school
and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution
but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get
pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years
yeah yeah exactly and if you're alienated
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah yeah
yeah it's sort of a a a rare select environment [laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah
right right sure
yeah it's a top rated institution and now i
um-hum um-hum
well i
i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick
schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research
and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors you know you're going to see some TA you know uh
so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hm
yeah you won't get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description you'd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and
yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time
so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job
but oh well [laughter]
um-hum
[noise]
i'd encourage it
it's a good general e- ed- education for a
a bachelor's degree
and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a
any post graduate program there but you get a
an excellent
wide
uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but
maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there
um
well the
for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that
that stage in their life uh other people it uh it's
uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um
it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think
more than anything else in this day and age that's got to
be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of
how much you're gonna pay
no matter where you go to school
and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're
probably going to be paying off or have been or
uh-huh
oh that's good
oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated
or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts i mean you could have uh
yeah
exactly
it's it's staggering when you think that just
here in central New York is uh Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south
from where i am and uh
they're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now
a year
at just a small
i mean they they they are s- it is a select college
oh yeah but you're talking incredible tuitions now i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh
i get i- i just couldn't ima- i mean it's more money than i make in a year so [laughter] you know it you know me being one person with a above the median
income for New York state you know i'm a s- i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and uh
i e- even as a
somebody making twice what i was making how could you
put half of that into
to your child's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's
my God i can't imagine
yes
i'd
or
or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of
leadership quality in their own
and that yeah the s- it's the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh
you know i- i agree with that because i see people
that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and
they do the same old things they did in high school
and
same patterns of behavior same
uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like it's like frozen time you know
it is it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that
um or their experiences haven't been broadened at all that you know its a
it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear
all these different sides of the story
that you never thought of
and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for
different point differing points of view you know or different opinions
yeah exactly
yeah
oh i
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
right
well your education's a lot what you make of it too so
yeah
well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being
i work in a in a labora- an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh
MIT graduates that are in there
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that i think i've ever run into even even more so
uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i- i mean i have to ad- confess to that
yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and
you know
certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that
but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it it's a
i- i have more re- i have a lot of respect for MIT master's and doctorate uh
degrees but but their undergrads are like
i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them even graduated
but uh
i don't know
right
right
nope
the
yeah
no
it's interesting that you mention that i didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all
all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange
instruct professors from other
schools but
uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as
doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future officer corps and so
i hear horr- horror stories from
friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day
i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh
would invite me over to their house for extended
study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and
no no and that
no
right right publish first and then [laughter]
right
yeah
yeah it's [vocalized-noise] there's a lot of factors that people
don't ever ever consider
in in their selection of a college and uh i don't know maybe
i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that
[noise]
so
i really haven't seen any movies lately i the only two movies i've seen were uh
uh King Ralph which really was depressing wasn't any any good
yeah
and
well it's not worth the whatever five bucks or four four fifty whatever you pay for you know to get into the movie but
yeah yeah or i saw Chima Para Diso uh Chima Para Diso
it's a foreign film
it's a an Italian film about uh this guy who uh
who from when he was a little kid like ten years old
yeah
italian accent
yeah
yeah it's it's about a movie about you know this guy who was running a a movie
you know movie studio whatever he ran he ran a machine that was pretty good didn't you think so
i thought yeah i thought that most Americans might not like it because you know of it's it's not that good of a quality film but i mean it's the meaning behind it that i liked
uh-huh
i di- i thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person you know from when he was a little kid to little older to little older to except the last the the very last you know the last person the last actor that played the kid
you know when he had gray hair he didn't look anything like him but you know up until that point they did a really good job of keeping you know an actor who
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
yeah i hear that's pretty good
oh is it
yeah i do
well it depends on what mood you're in too you know
like for example Tequila Sunrise i liked that
uh i don't know
yeah is that supposed to be something like that one
yeah
that's pretty good
well what have you seen that that
uh-huh
no i don't watch that show
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
maybe you expected too much out of it
uh-huh
Wild At Heart
about what
uh-huh
so he just gets in trouble everywhere
um
yeah
yeah
i don't i don't like to look too deep into movies if it's good it's good if it's not it's not
[laughter]
yeah
i want to go see The Doors that's what i want to go see
i'm twenty one
uh-huh
right well i mean i i you know i'm pretty familiar with the story of Jim Morrison i mean i don't know everything about it but
uh-huh
uh
i heard i heard that it that what what is it Siskel and Ebert someone told me that Siskel and Ebert said that
one of the two liked the whole movie but he doesn't like the ending so he wouldn't recommend the movie and he didn't like the ending because
of the way Jim Morrison's life ended and it's like that's ridiculous i mean that's a true life story How can you not like something that really you know is if it happened it happened you're just telling a story
uh-huh
Val Kilmer
uh-huh
the real story yeah
right
yeah
right yeah Oliver Stone isn't it
yeah
but he's a good director so i mean he should still be able to
uh-huh
oh i liked Platoon it was all right but i didn't see Wall Street
yeah
well i think i'll go see that this weekend or next weekend one or the other
because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didn't have it playing home
for like spring break and
yeah i'm still in college
uh my uh roommate took a voice over course
and they told him to sign up for this and he asked me if i wanted to do it and i said sure you know it's like just you know to help out whatever you know the the more participants you have the bigger
uh you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and and
i guess they wouldn't be called dialects but they're pretty close sometimes
[laughter]
right
yeah
well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh
uh it's a it's called UAB uh university something or other i don't know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre for a dollar
and and so you know like every other day or or so they have like movies for a dollar Sometimes they're even free i think uh they showed uh Chima Para Diso free
uh but i missed it so i rented it the other day
uh-huh
yeah i liked it but i didn't i didn't know if the Americans would like it so much they might you know look into it and say uh this is low budget film and it's not really that good but i mean i like the story
[laughter]
right
yeah
yeah
right
they were they were i mean i you know i i go to Italy every summer ex- i missed last summer but i mean it's like that you go into the small towns especially you know like in where he was in Sicily
and the southern part of Italy everything is like that you know and no one has any money you know you just barely get by But everybody is like a big family and it's like it's just like that so that's why i liked it i guess i'm a little biased but i i- i- i- i- thought
yeah
[noise]
so what movies have you seen lately
oh was bad
oh that's disappointing i was thinking about going to see that
yeah
wait for it to come out on videotape i guess
what's the other one
oh say that again
what's that
uh-huh
uh-huh oh Cinema Para De Simo oh okay because you're saying it with a you're saying it little Italian oh are you Italian oh okay that's why go ahead
uh-huh
yeah i saw it too
yeah it was i really liked it my wife and i loved it yeah
uh-huh yep that's true yeah it had a really uh i thought the story was really nice and i thought uh the guy that played the projectionist i just thought was superb you know he was great uh and the little boy was good too
uh-huh
yeah
yeah yeah they did well i think that's the guy that uh it was like his story
i think he was like a Italian director or something like that and i think that was himself he was he that was his own story
on what's made him successful or whatever yeah so of course he picked probably all these really good looking young people you know yeah yeah i liked that too yeah um we um my wife and i are planning on trying to go see um
uh Silence of The Lambs tonight
yeah it's a suspense well i guess it's ranked number one now it's supposed to be pretty good suspenseful yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that yeah see because i i'm not really one that likes real sus- i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time
yeah that's true yeah but uh
yeah well that well that was that's with uh who's what's his name's in it uh
Mel Gibson
and uh what's his yeah that was a good movie too that was good i
yeah yeah something like that except it's it's supposed to be really you know suspenseful yeah so i guess but we're you know it's been rated pretty well and every all the critics like it so and every word of mouth has been pretty good on it so
yeah we're we're going to go see that probably tonight
[noise] uh actually let's see we we uh we've rented a couple movies lately you know because you get them on videotape we rented uh just last night we watched um
David Lynch's uh movie Blue Velvet
which which is that it it sort of has some of the some of the music behind it [vocalized-noise] did you ever watch Twin Peaks
[noise] yeah well that it has some of the mu- we've wa- we watched Twin Peaks because uh uh a little bit so it ha- you know and i think she had seen part of it before
friends of hers had rented it and she'd seen part of it but we thought we'd rent the whole thing and actually it's a pretty good movie but it's not great you know
they said it's supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn't think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don't know i we also
yeah i think yeah that's probably true yeah we also saw Wild At Heart which is also a David Lynch movie that that that had been out now that was a weird movie
that wa- yeah that wa-
it was it was about uh a guy uh Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley like a like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie he's like a real violent uh
twenty year old and he uh he's in love with this girl that's about sixteen or seventeen and they leave he's involved with like a murder and then um
he they go to uh
they go to like Louisiana and Texas
and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but it's sort of
yeah he gets in trouble everywhere he goes it's real violent
and uh
you know which is like what David Lynch's other movies were about you know the so i don't know i just i didn't think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies
yeah but i didn't think it was that good
yeah that that's sort of the way i feel too i don't know what else we just saw something recently
yeah they say that's pretty good well how old are you
twenty one oh see you're young so you you see i'm thirty one so you see this as like a mythical thing you know so you're like
yeah uh-huh
yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't
yeah so i think uh but i think it's supposed to be well done
uh-huh
right yeah [laughter] yeah
uh-huh that's true yeah i guess i guess uh i well i was watching uh Arsenio Hall the other night and uh
the actor that plays Jim Morrison's one of the other uh
uh not Val Kilmer the um
Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band uh was on was on uh Arsenio and he was talking about it you know and uh he said that uh they tried to stick pretty much to you know
the real story and and and for to for all of them to get an understanding of how their characters were they c- they watched older videotapes you know of their them in interviews and things like that so they tried to make it pretty you know close to the line
but uh they also said that whatever the guy that directed it
i don't [vocalized-noise] he uh he's very he really liked The Doors so it was very much his impression too you know so so if you have
yeah yeah and he's a very strong willed person and his his ideas whatever came through you know with however so they said if if you um
yeah so so if you like his view and his direction in other words then you'll really like the movie you know so probably if you liked his other two movies uh those are like Wall Street and Platoon then
yeah yeah if you like Plat- yeah if you liked Platoon you'll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think
so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good
yeah
uh-huh
yeah oh you in college
well why are you participating in this study
yeah um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] the more participants the better it works out because i'm a voice researcher
right uh-huh yeah that's true
yeah that's what they're yeah that's what they're really looking for
i think just how we speak also looking where we pause and where we don't things like that yeah but that's pretty that's good um what do you get many movies on campus
uh-huh right yeah
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah yeah because my wife and i saw it in the theatre we really liked it
yeah it was a great that's a i think that's that's one thing too um you know you can't get [vocalized-noise] so much caught up in the expense
as as you do a good telling a good story and i thought that was that movie really told a good story
and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you don't notice that it's a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have
you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
but see i really think yeah i- i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised
well do you have a lawn
oh good so who cuts the grass
[laughter]
well i used to own a home and when i owned my house i had a small yard and a small front yard and a small backyard then i cut the grass
but i sold it so now i live in an apartment
so i don't have to fool with any of it no
oh then my wife and you would probably get along well um-hum
[laughter]
yeah we talk about um
Laura talks about growing uh right right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box
and i think that's but i think uh a- after we um
after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden
yeah
yeah th- yeah th- and that's the big problem with being in an apartment is we've talked about it and even uh Laura even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots
you know that we could put on the front porch and because the apartment complex actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps
and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty
um-hum
yep yep
yeah well we wouldn't have to worry about that [laughter]
right now we're going through we just it just rained all day today or it's been raining most of the morning drizzling off and on but yeah
oh really this is what is it i guess your growing season's just about to begin oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's a [vocalized-noise]
yeah see we're a little bit later than that but that's right that's about right about the same yeah
but i think um i think you you though must have much warmer weather through the winter so that's
um-hum
yeah
yeah and then July and August yeah
um-hum
hum
right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done
by um well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in uh in October the begi- very be- first week of October
but normally everything's done by September end of September means you're basically done growing anything
um-hum yeah because it
oh gee that'd be nice
um-hum we don't even grow okra up here
yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah
well i think it it it it's getting um a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the um
first you know first the big wave of Tex-Mex food came by you know and so we're we're big into tacos and stuff up here now and and taco salads and things
which they probably Mexican people don't even know what a taco salad is but i think it's now it's moving up too because uh just a change you know just something different
plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the uh the mid Atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes
i think it's our Irish descent
yeah but i think it it's changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldn't have known what it was when i was a teenager though
well we were going to probably just going to start well because we're going to be moving we're talking about just putting throwing tomatoes in
you know and then uh but also things like tulips i think uh i would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now you know
um-hum
yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our sister-in-law Laura's
brother's wife you know was talking about you know putting strawberries uh moving their strawberries because they just moved
i it's this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers
and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them i think but they're going to let them bloom this year in the containers
um-hum
um-hum would you have to stake them up d- aren't th- do they grow along the ground strawberries
uh-huh
yeah
huh
oh
see i've never grown strawberries
um-hum
yeah
um-hum just water
um-hum well they say aren't maybe you're supposed to cut them back cut them and [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah rotationary thing
oh that's interesting see because i've never really grown strawberries lot of tomatoes but never really strawberries
uh
yeah
[laughter]
hundreds of thousand you can't even give them away [vocalized-noise]
i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes
so whenever somebody would come over your house they'd always bring some tomatoes well but you grew your own tomatoes
so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day
it's really funny
uh-huh
oh yeah
um-hum
well that's makes sense though
um-hum
um oh you are a big gardener huh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow
because that's a when i had my yard it was you know it was it was really a hassle
uh cutting grass was just a terr- just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it
oh
yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah
[laughter] yeah that
[laughter]
my uh my brother went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he he just had bought a house he lived in an apartment before
and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy one and he said that that you know basically th- they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing
the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it
so you know of course he w- couldn't buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the uh one of the Aames or
the the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with four wheels you know with four wheel drive
it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it one year he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller
because he said it was just too dang heavy
[laughter] yeah plus i think he lives at a small hillside too so
yeah c- trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh well it's probably his his his personal time while he's cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else
it's probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you you know you're on your own
yes we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a pretty good size front yard
my husband it's not a job that i enjoy at all
so you don't have to fool with any of that anymore
[laughter]
well i'm big into the plant i like the the flower beds and plants a lot better than i do the lawn
so
yeah i had used to have a garden until the kids got older and we don't have any more room in the backyard so now all i've got is flowers instead of vegetables
hum
um-hum
yeah it's nice to have nothing is better than going out there and picking your own tomatoes or different vegetables and things to eat
um-hum
um-hum
um
yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because i've done some of it before
you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesn't dry out
and so that your plants because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times
once a here in Dallas you have to water sometimes twice a day because it gets so hot in the summer
[laughter]
um
well we've got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere all of our neighbors are out scalping their lawn for the first time
yes we hit our we'll hit our last spring freeze
it snowed here as late as May before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth
and so we're all everybody's out planting and buying and
seeing what died
um-hum
yeah it makes it nice for gardening when it's when it's like that because we can grow a lot of things
even through the winter that uh y'all can't grow we can start i can start a garden in July i've done that and and plant some of the uh
sturdier crops broccoli and things like that you have to really water it a lot when it's when it's young like that and it's in the heat but then
then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful second crop
of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes that's the only some peas and different things like that that's the only time of the year you can grow them
because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer
um-hum
yeah
um yeah but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker because we can grow sometimes there have been times when when i've grown stuff out i've grown broccoli up and through November
and still have it producing and okra okra will grow real okra will grow to be six foot tall it's just
yeah you probably don't have the right temperatures and stuff probably not too many people eat it up there either it seems to be kind of a southern delicacy
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
maybe so
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
oh well what's your favorite plant if you were you know you were talking about your containers maybe you were going to get those started what would you like to put in them
um-hum
yeah tulips is just kind of late because you have to you have to force them
if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges
um-hum
yeah they'll work that way and th- they're kind of pretty they've got little white flowers and
long as you
no
they'd grow kind of like a vine they they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would
and and along those is wh- that's where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them when you plant strawberries you plant them like
six to eight inches or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you co- you put them eight inches apart all through a flower bed
and by the next year you'll have pretty much a solid bed of strawberries
they're real simple that's why i like them i just put a bunch out because you just put them out there and you water them
the bugs don't least h- at least here the bugs don't particularly bother them
and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year
yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they don't last forever
it that can help but you just get to a point where they're just not productive anymore
it's just a kind of uh just the way the plant is
yeah
yeah i like tomatoes but i always end up with when i've grown them i- i end up with the little cherry tomatoes
just thousands of them and i can't figure out what to do with them all
[vocalized-noise] yeah because everybody else is growing
the same kind of thing
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah some other things that'll grow good in those containers and you can you can mix and match the flowers with your your vegetables and grow around them marigolds and impatiens
they do real good especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when you're on a porch area part of the time
i mix all all my flower beds are mixed up i've got onions behind the irises and [laughter]
[laughter]
all back and forth and around yeah because they're going be they'll grow now from now until the about
middle of June then i'll have all the onions and they'll be out and then i'll put in some flowers
some annuals for the rest of the year and some color
yeah i like getting in the dirt i just don't i hate mowing [laughter]
it's just too hot and it has to be done too often
yeah
yeah with ours it wouldn't be so bad we had a self propelled mower but the self propelled part broke
and so it doesn't and then and then it weighs a ton
because it's
yeah and it's so it's supposed to pull itself along and my husband it doesn't bother him and h- i'm got out and mowed for him one day just to be nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home
and i said what is with this mower i can't even push it around the yard
and you know he's like well i get more exercise pushing it around
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
too many trips around the yard with that thing huh for sure
oh gosh
oh yeah
that's the other thing with my husband he gets
he he's one of these people he didn't care about the flower beds and stuff w- i guess we divide it pretty well that way but he he gets real picky about the grass he wants to get out there and he cuts it on diagonal
and goes all this back and forth and you know and gets the weed eater out and trims all the little bits around the flower beds and all the little bits around the trees that he didn't get
he'll go out there and spend four hours on the lawn
i guess
[laughter]
no nobody's going to bother you
okay
[laughter]
um drug testing doesn't bother me
no uh i've been drug tested twice at TI and it doesn't bother me
uh
[laughter]
why why does it bother you
i know i understand uh
well that's true i- i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift
so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy
do yeah okay
that's true
feel bad yeah i don't drink anymore but i can remember [laughter]
[laughter]
i can remember the you know there's nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse
than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didn't work for TI so but you you know really and truly th-
there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right and you cannot perform well
that's true
course through this i think that they've helped a lot of people also uh
a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at TI do you work for TI
okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and that's probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff
the drug can use you [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
that's true
that's true
yep
well
you can't i mean it and you [vocalized-noise] you just run the risk of
of of
getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it's not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that
oh i didn't know they took you off the job
wow
who can afford that [laughter] my God i can't afford to miss a day let alone six
now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the pres- wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that
they didn't
okay
yeah
now see that i wouldn't agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit
here and there too without you know if if it's a case like that because look how many people take their husband's or their wife's
medication you know but that's a really good example
yeah yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or or that they should listen
i mean because i- i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wife's medicine that just doesn't sound right does it
so it seems like they should be able to bend [noise] the rules oops excuse me a little bit
on that but you but i don't know because i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know
you know
ooh
oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes
so does alcohol show up in these tests
so so it wouldn't show up yeah well it's not that's true see there's the there it is right there it's not illegal
and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this
you know they wouldn't be testing
which doesn't make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can't work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that
and so if it was made legal
[vocalized-noise] that doesn't make it any safer on the job [laughter]
get hurt yeah
[laughter] have you had to do it yet
oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think
the with the January that they started it up i got called
so i was one of the first ones but but y- did you get tested when you got hired
okay so you were well i- i got tested before i got hired too so
but
hum
[noise]
[laughter]
i'm not young anymore [laughter]
[laughter] i quit
i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't sm- i don't smoke i gave everything up
so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i [laughter]
oh i have a lot of friends that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something
you know and and i'm even afraid to be around it
because i'm afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if if you're if a room full of it
into my bloodstream
yeah and with my luck there'd be the notice Monday you know go take your test and that would scare me
how can you prove it
no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely
so
well this has been interesting
but
huh
sort well sort of i mean i- i agree with a lot of what you said
lead on
doesn't bother you
well we differ there
it bothers me
i just feel like it's an invas- invasion of my privacy
you know i you know there's a lot alcohol for example
i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job
than if i go out on Friday and
i don't know say t- take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night
not saying that i do but i'm just
i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted
i- i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know in- indicates that they're
they're obviously not all there they're
you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but
i think a lot of people are going to go out and
you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place
and they're going to find they're going to go out and drink instead because they know that it's their job on the line
and uh
you know i've been i've come to work hung over in the morning and i know i'm worthless
[vocalized-noise]
but
and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you
but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i d- do agree that drug abuse should be punished
but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time
in such a way that doesn't inter- interfere with their responsibilities
you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business
yeah yeah i do
i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't
they they don't know how to
use drugs for recreational purposes without
it becoming you know a dominant force in their life
i mean yeah it's it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on Friday night and maybe
you know i don't have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever
that's fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it
and and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it
you know you're you're always doing it
i don't know
i mean i- i work for TI so i don't do drugs you know
right
it's too big a risk yeah
but you're without a paycheck during that time
and i don't at least that's my understanding is even
you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work
i was that i was told that uh
somebody had uh some woman had
had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them anyway had uh
come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling
and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know
i mean i've always been yeah the first time so what i'll go explain myself and and
that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just
you know there there were no
oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah
well i think
i don't know anybody personally either
i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recrela recreationally and there's such a big difference
yeah i- i don't know
it's it's kind of i've also been
you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but uh
who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse
you know
yeah but
everybody covers up you know it's the good old boy thing
i don't know
i don't think so they don't test for it i mean
it's not illegal
well that's true
no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance
and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt
yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on some given day i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and
you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so
no see i was i've been working for TI for almost eight years
i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did
because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends
spend my money and you know i
if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's
that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess
you know
i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still
no i don't smoke i quit doing that and i've tried to quit drinking but it's
the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't
a regular drug user
but uh
i- i understand
i understand
i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me
get me in trouble
so see it didn't use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say
okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that
you can't but at least you've got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you don't have a job because you tested positive
that you know that's that's devastating how you know i can't live without my income for six weeks there's no way
exactly
so i don't know
yeah opposing viewpoints there
i said opposing viewpoints
for the most part
[noise]
so what kind of music do you like
yeah that's same here
do you
yeah
uh-huh yeah that's about that's about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here
it's uh gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody it's uh one hundred percent listener supported
and it's a twenty four hour station
yeah they they get a lot of support here
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah that's the good thing about them they do no advertising that's it's really nice just music
yeah i li- i like PBS
uh PBS here you can't get it unless you have cable
and that really upsets me because i won't pay cable prices because there's it's it's useless having cable i think
it's uh it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there
yeah exactly
i've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but
i've avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS
because they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature
yeah
[noise]
yeah
um-hum
yeah i- i had cable before i uh came up here
and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss Discovery Channel and A&E and CNN
you know i'm having CNN withdrawal pains [laughter]
every once in a while um
uh occasionally down in Charlotte
yeah it it's it's pretty good
um yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i been into Boston a few times uh i was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and went out to the um
Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and
they're good they're really
oh really
yeah i Boston's okay i mean i wouldn't want to live there but it's a nice place to visit
yeah it's crowded i know that
it's murder driving in that place
yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic
[laughter]
um-hum
well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i'm surprised we're not killing more people than we are
seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year
um human factors
that's um well it's sort of difficult to explain it's
it's industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the h- from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it
and and
yeah it that's very similar
yeah very similar um
uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff
yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing that's why it's it was the uh professor who brought this thing in he'd gone to a conference
down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i'll do it
why not
hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call that's okay
you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place
um-hum
where's she at
yeah there's
yeah there's not too many not too many big ones around here
uh matter fact we don't have any big ones [laughter]
after you know after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta you come here and you know they people think Charlotte is the big town you know
and it's small [laughter]
yeah
uh Charlotte oh what about
quarter of a million
oh it's fairly good size i mean it's it's not it's not small but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards
course everything's small cons- compared to Atlanta
yeah my my brother and uh sister-in-law live there i like
yeah Atlanta's Atlanta's a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five
but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay
but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it's more east
uh along I eighty five
and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day
i never managed to plan my departure right
oh yeah
yeah yeah it's scary
it's scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day
yeah oh it's a busy it's a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there
amazingly few
because uh i mean if you're flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you can't avoid it
it's the hub city
and uh God
um-hum yeah
yeah that's super it's getting even better too
yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it
all kinds of good stuff go
yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty
[noise] what was it
eighty six
so it's been it's been five years for me
yeah it just doesn't stop
i mean it
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure
yeah exactly
couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't
because it's really going downhill up there
well you know i- i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius
and then i- i- i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election
because it certainly wasn't sustained
well
yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway
you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him
you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything
hopefully
no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking
so
yeah well you can't
you can't trust legislators anyway
[noise]
yeah we n- we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation
[laughter]
i like all kinds of music actually
i'm kind of partial to country western i like that
and i like mood music like you know when i'm in the mood for that i like semi-classical
the real classics i'm not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing
uh-huh
oh huh
oh that's fantastic
well we have a similar um radio station here
and because of the uh people i guess being pressured to have advertisers
you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like
compromised
and they do some of it at like certain hours but it's not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so
you you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know
uh-huh
we have that on TV we have two public uh broadcasting systems uh channel two and thirty six
also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming
yeah yep same thing
uh-huh
it is it's expensive
no and the the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices
and you're if you have it you just have to pay it
you know that's the hard part
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
yep
see we have cable here
and almost everyone here has cable
and it it's uh it's good because you don't need the outside antennas with your TV and stuff and it gives you a lot more um
of the other you know of the widest uh uh television that's available to you
uh-huh
yeah that's what i like
yep right and i love that
uh-huh
[laughter] do you go to the theatre for for music uh
have you been to the opera ever
yeah
oh that's nice
i've seen Man of La Mancha and uh a few of those you know that in Boston and uh i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did
i've seen a few musicals and i uh go to Atlantic City once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when i'm there
especially like when they have special singers and things and La Cage au Faux that was excellent
uh-huh
oh wow
well we're only about two hours from there yeah
no
right in fact i
sure is
isn't it awful
oh yeah i- i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show
because even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning
and that's really i think that's a very serious thing you know i'm surprised they haven't had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that
oh i know it's true it's true
so what are you majoring in
oh and and what is that
oh
oh i see
yeah we had someone from uh do some ergonomics in our area do you do
cover some of that yeah
oh oh oh
oh well then this is right up your alley what they're trying
yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
really
sure sure
yeah it's true it is in in fact i have a friend of mine that moved to North Carolina
she's um an emergency room nurse she does the operating room
and uh she's been down there a couple years and she really loves it
i don't know the city
all i know is it's down in in North Carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her
you know what city she was in i didn't but she said it's really nice
[vocalized-noise]
no
[laughter]
yeah
oh wow
really
what's the population
oh that's that's pretty good size though
yeah
yeah
yeah
i- i liked Atlanta too i have a sister-in-law that lives in Atlanta
they she uh she in fact went from Massachusetts to uh Florida then to Atlanta and she really really likes it
yeah
yeah yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
[laughter]
the airport's something down there
oh my God i- i swear those [vocalized-noise] planes going or coming going or coming
it is it's um
yes
unbeliev-
in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldn't believe
the traffic
it is
i know isn't it
unreal
uh-huh
yep yep
i went there to to visit the Underground when that was you know the Underground City
and i thought that was really neat
that amazing
oh really
is that right
course i haven't been there in about uh eight years
so
yeah
five years
the the growth in that place is phenomenal
they don't stand still that's for sure
we're having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and
credit unions and all that kind of good stuff
and it's starting to effect you know the economy
because of uh the uh businesses that have their money tied up
every place you go you know the
uh-huh
yeah yeah
it has i don't know what they're going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick
yeah
yeah
sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isn't what really did everything in
because he wasn't really paying attention to business you know
you can't do both things well
no true but uh
yeah
that's true
yep that's true
yeah [laughter] somebody has to watch the store though you can't really you know without overseeing
sure sure
look at what happened just in Washington alone God
it's mind boggling
[laughter]
no
well it's been interesting talking to you
but oh yeah right [laughter] i hope to hear
[noise]
so what kind of garden do you have
oh
um well that's n- nice little garden
oh do you get get a good crop of plums
oh hadn't gotten any um yeah
um yeah sounds nice i used to we we had some wild plum trees growing in a field when i was a near my house when i was a kid we used to go out there and raid it
that's great love plums
yeah
yeah it's same around here too makes you wonder what they're what they're sending out i mean [vocalized-noise] yeah where is it
because certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff i mean they use the junk for that it makes me wonder gosh if they're using junk for that what are we getting here [laughter]
oh really
yeah i i've gotten to where i won't even buy juices anymore because i'm afraid of what's in there
well i don't do very much gardening i- i would like to but i just don't have the time to do it or keep it up right i- i try to get into some flowers and stuff i just
placed an order again for some bulbs and waiting for those to show up and
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well i started
yeah i started some about uh about a month ago and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to them and that was the end of them
yeah th- these two cats it's hard to keep anything around [laughter]
yeah really [laughter] th- these these cats are just about as bad as kids [laughter] i've got one that can even open the cupboard doors and get in inside the cabinets
yeah she's yeah she's got it wired now she jumps up on the counter and stands up reaches up for the door and pulls on it till it opens and then jumps up in there
i know i i've been seeing all these weird things they send in and i uh i says gee i ought to get that
um you never know [laughter] kitty cat what do you think about being a star [laughter] i'll buy you buy you lots of cat food with that [laughter]
yeah you believe that [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah
yeah
yeah and all that stuff well i'm i'm pretty easy as far as yard work i'll go out there and cut it and i'll edge it if it dies it dies [laughter]
[laughter]
no i uh i'll take my chances with it course now where i where i'm at now i don't have to worry about the lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it
it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we've had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that
yeah i guess i- i guess we're really into spring now
i don't i like winter yeah i li- i like cold dreary weather
yeah i it it's
hum-um no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota
it's just great up there
no this is another one of those winters that wasn't
yeah it's i don't know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here [laughter] but uh they didn't get a lot of snow in the mountains either
yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course we'd had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up
because those i mean those those summers up there are brutal
terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it's uh it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i
i- i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me
yeah i i've been thinking about it [laughter] only problem is i- i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there
yeah yeah the uh i mean there's still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know
yeah i
that's all right that's just [noise] another one wanting to get in on the conversation
oh i meant to ask you can you hear me okay on this thing okay good it's it's a it's a it's a headset so it makes it a little easier
oh no i don't i'm a i'm a student uh
[vocalized-noise] just about everybody i've talked to has been with TI i guess that's i guess that's the same with your husband
yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago
um came in late too it was like eleven thirty at night and i answered it and
i said yeah well you know i'm not doing anything so i took it and the subject was discuss the weather and find out how your weather compares to the caller's weather
well the interesting thing was this was from another student at state right across town from me [laughter]
i mean yeah gosh what's you weather like you know well i don't know let me look out my window yeah it's kind of foggy tonight [laughter]
[vocalized-noise] oh that ice storm yeah
yeah i talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester and same story they uh they really had a lot of damage from uh ice and all that
yeah yeah that's pretty bad
oh
oh sounds like that young one wants some attention
oh oh that's okay [laughter]
yeah Rochester's a nice town too they they said that they had had uh lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out
that's too bad because i
yeah yeah that's too bad because i i i had a an old an ex-professor who
uh is up there in Rochester
and he told me about how much they had worked to beautify the place
and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now it's all been wiped out it's a shame
oh well such is life [laughter]
yeah exactly it's like me with gardens i can go out there and plant a garden and then watch the bugs and
uh-huh you get a get a frost or something hail that's even better
yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean i've had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons
and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever
uh-huh cantaloupe's difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean they're they're easy enough they'll grow easy enough but you can't get any flavor
yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah
and then i said well i'll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know
uh-huh it's like oranges and everything else but anyway
oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldn't buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh
uh we have a vegetable garden with a we have some onions potatoes uh broccoli spinach lettuce radishes
yeah we he p- we plant quite a bit and we have the you know peach tree and a plum tree and
so
uh well we just planted the plum tree this year so we haven't uh haven't gotten anything off of that hopefully this will be the first year for our peaches we're hoping to get something off of that so
oh
uh-huh
yeah we uh i i love plums and peach i just love all fruit you know
and it's hard to come you know the i don't know the fruit we get down here at the store has just been pretty lousy lately so [noise] yeah it's like
yeah like where does all the good stuff go yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of it
uh-huh
yeah
what are we [laughter] yeah yeah hat's in the juice [laughter] this is what i would put in juice
uh-huh that's so true yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah we got some bulbs but we haven't gotten them planted uh my husband's uh been growing uh lots of flowers from seed and
all of his own plants under a a light he put out in the garage to help keep them you know alive and get them a good start so we hope we have a lot of flowers this year so
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah we don't have any pets so
[laughter] yeah like my husband says we just have two kids it's hard to keep them out of things let alone pets [laughter]
[laughter]
oh no that's no fun
uh-huh
oh you ought to you ought to send a [vocalized-noise] videotape that and send it into America's Home Videos yeah
that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so
that's right
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
that's right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you don't have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and
so that's it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you're always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it's
[laughter]
oh that's nice
uh-huh
yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out
you know in their front yards doing their yard and
it's a perfect day for it
yeah i i love spring i just love it
do you oh not me
oh i don't i i grew up in Wyoming and it's cold enough there for me so
uh-huh
oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina
oh winter that wasn't huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems this summer so
uh-huh
that's right they need the the snow for the water so
uh-huh
and just dries everything out
uh-huh
oh well it sounds like you need to move back there
[laughter]
yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany
yeah but it's hard to make it being a rancher or farmer
what Brittany
okay good hon sorry [laughter]
oh yeah she she was wanting
uh-huh yeah i hear you just fine
oh
yeah You doing lots of these calls you work for TI
oh
oh okay my
uh-huh
yeah he works for them right now he's been there almost six years now
oh wow
[laughter]
i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah
oh [laughter]
[laughter] oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather
[laughter]
[laughter] i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and
uh-huh
yeah yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything
yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so [laughter] we really had a lot to compare so
oh i she's talking to my husband i think so yeah so
oh yeah that's what she said they they were going to ha- the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area
uh-huh
oh yeah it really is
yeah it seems like you work hard and something else goes wrong nothing's forever i guess
oh that's what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and
uh-huh or hail [laughter]
yeah it just you know
uh-huh
oh my word
oh was it
we trew grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were just tasteless you couldn't even eat them
yeah
uh-huh
yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah nope you don't it's hard to pick them
oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so
so
uh-huh
yeah they're all
[noise]
okay i guess we're on the air now
uh i haven't had too much experience with uh judges and jurors
i've uh served on a jury one time and uh i think one of my concerns after that experience was
uh finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone
[vocalized-noise]
um
yeah i'm inclined to agree you do need a uh fixed and clear sentence there
yeah
yes
um-hum
yeah i think that was a logical decision there
um-hum
w- well yeah i think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence
uh but that was that was fairly quick i think that is something that we need in this country i know the last time i was down in the Caribbean
uh we had visited the island of uh Saint Thomas which is American
and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it
at the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of Tortola and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place
i've never uh really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question
um-hum
yes
i don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that though it's it depends on the the tr- they can ask uh points of order of law
and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript
uh but uh asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror uh well it was a traffic situation uh there were three points of law that had to be made
and the County Attorney did not make the points
but the uh defendant took the stand on his own behalf
unfortunately [laughter] he made the points himself in his own testimony
um-hum
um
i work for E Systems
okay
[laughter]
okay
[laughter]
oh i know Hal Ammon quite well
okay
well say hi to Al or Hal the next time you see him
and tell
yeah well tell him that Bill Mayhood sell h- said hi
okay
[vocalized-noise]
all right
thank you good night
[noise]
[noise]
right
yes i- i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness an- and uh and two murder trials
and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death
but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes
i think
depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory
for example uh armed robbery
uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past
um
certain types of uh
you know homicides
yes in in homicides related to other than i guess what are called uh crimes of passion uh for example you know as you as you very well know
the great majority of homicides are
people murdering other people they know mostly people they know
so in those instances uh that's uh i think that there is some leeway there what wa- is interesting in this regard is the recent case in New Hampshire
uh the schoolteacher
and the life sentence uh she received
yes
and it came very quickly surprisingly
uh i guess it was uh they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not
um-hum
um
[laughter]
well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some
uh people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of uh uh that that judges should have the
uh
the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i um
if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and
uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions
well that that that and that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before
i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury
they can ask questions
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum [noise] may i ask you a question
why does your voice sound familiar to me
that's [laughter] that's
probably why it does i work for GTE
[laughter]
your your voice you know when uh i didn't recognize the name but the more i listen to your voice i
uh i know i have heard it somewhere
and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic
[laughter]
but uh because i work for
uh Hal Ammon
yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE
[laughter]
so [laughter]
i [laughter]
i will and which will probably be the uh Monday as a matter of fact
okay Bill i recognize the name now i and uh my name is Jim Moscow
and uh so i've heard the name
and uh well back to the topic i guess we've talked long enough Bill
but uh all right well thank you for calling and nice and have a good weekend
good-bye
[noise]
well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News
and i try to look at it if i get busy [laughter] i don't get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been un- haven't been touched but uh
[noise] well not in the morning but um if the well i have two s- children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll
you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or [noise] sit in a chair by the window or something
um-hum
[laughter]
well we i don't take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at
like the [noise] nine o'clock PM and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it
well [laughter] he didn't have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
uh-huh
well i wouldn't think th- i would really say that that's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates
and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from
um-hum
[noise] yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any
um-hum
no i don't
hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um [noise]
[noise] yeah my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to
to keep an eye out for it but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio
um-hum
uh-huh [laughter]
[noise] do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television
um-hum
um well i am we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel
um-hum
well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the um anchors
are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer
a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people
um-hum
yes i have and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more more likely to get
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
oh really
well we you know like [noise] all of the stations seem to be pretty good it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into Houston so we had a
a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and
um-hum
um-hum
that's true their job
[noise] that's true so that really effects how they report the news
[laughter] with is he the sports
yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes it's nice bye-bye
[noise]
well do you have time to read the paper in the morning
you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we've been taking the Times Herald for ages and then
uh dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject
went outside picked it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to
to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines
did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage
well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time
[laughter] and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland
Garland Daily News i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some- but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this
as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial
and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and
yes
[laughter] yes and i- i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a
a ploy which was um i- i find that fascinating that uh
i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now
[vocalized-noise] it's on eleven ninety
[noise]
well when i go to work i listen
yeah
well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything
and and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the CNN uh i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm i'm inveterate switcher
that ninety eight point seven i'm i'm eclectic approach
well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so
well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then
they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i- i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations
[vocalized-noise] i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that
yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i- i- i grew up in Alabama and so i- i have some prejudices
but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i'm not sure i i'm
totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases the- there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and
and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have
have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own
where'd you move from
[vocalized-noise] yeah
it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so
twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago
and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too [vocalized-noise] anyway didn't he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds and that's interesting is that's that's what the TV stations do they're trying to get ratings
and i think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings
and some well it's like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight li- is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes
okay well good talking to you good night
[noise]
have you been having any uh good weather lately
oh i'm in Texas Plano uh-huh
yes i do
yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so i'm taking care of that but uh yeah it's nice and sunny out
uh not lately [laughter] but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too
uh-huh
no i'm from Wisconsin originally uh i don't know what the weather's been like up there but uh typically in March it's still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold
w- we had a real mild winter here though
[laughter] okay i can believe that uh-huh
no i've well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i'm sure
i think it depends on what part of the state
but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend
and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive
yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing
yeah
you know i've been here about thirteen years and i've gotten qu- quite acclimated to the weather i the summers don't bother me anymore at all i don't mind when it gets over a hundred degrees
[laughter]
yeah
sure
i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again
[laughter]
well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh
i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our [vocalized-noise] or uh share of hundred degree days
no i never have
i've been close uh was in Detroit one time just right right across the river from Windsor
yeah i believe that
i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there
they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there
so it's stayed cold for the entire week
um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold
we don't get too much snow here
well i can live without ice [laughter]
yeah the snow is nice doesn't usually last too long here
yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here
other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or two
we
uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon
what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment
yeah
that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down
that's right we didn't close at all this past winter
yeah
well we usually have to make them up though so [laughter]
uh well i work at the main set in Dallas [vocalized-noise] yeah uh-huh
i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago
much rain
yeah Thursday
i didn't get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson
yeah i don't think we got uh i don't think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people
so they usually get uh worse weather [vocalized-noise] than we do
in winter too
yeah
an- we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year
no i sure haven't
it's i think it's supposed to be nice though
seventies eighties i guess
i've been checking on my plants seeing th- the roses bud out already
yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it's supposed to
waiting for the wai- waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter
but uh like i said i stayed in today because i picked up a cold the other day so didn't feel like going outside and doing much
uh-huh
yeah we we really h- didn't get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now [laughter] and they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not
uh-huh
well you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you d- than you do outside [laughter]
okay
yeah i don't do well with potted plants outside i tend to ne- neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don't put them in the sun they don't grow [laughter]
i don't know but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready t- to go outside and do some outdoor activities
okay
well
uh
i haven't heard the forecast for the ne- for uh [vocalized-noise] coming up for this weekend or next week so i'm not sure what to expect
i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice
uh-huh
i'm not sure what the overnight low was
oh yeah
guess i'll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect
anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for March
have to see what uh April or May have to offer
sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February
well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes
well it leaves a mess then when it does melt [vocalized-noise] everything thaws out
lot of mu-
well today was really nice the past few days have been rather chilly uh we had a lot of rain recently i'm in Texas where are you
oh you are do you work for TI oh i see
yeah so then we've been having just about the same weather [laughter]
yeah
have you been doing anything outside in this great weather
no
yeah i know we had a tornado wa- watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened
are you originally from uh Texas
the
um-hum
well i lived in New York for a long time so Texas is Texas weather is quite uh different for me
yeah we did w- uh they're always mild to me compared to New York winters have you have you ever been to New York in the winter
uh-huh
right
[noise] right
yeah the only thing i don't like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer
yeah [noise]
yeah like New York was really humid you know you
but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was
i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties
and it was
pretty pleasant except for the humidity
uh-huh
well at least you can plan you can say well uh i'm going to go to the beach next Wednesday and you'll know that it's going to be hot enough to go
but i- in New York you really never know you can plan [vocalized-noise] t- you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something
uh-huh
yeah
ye- i'm sure it will in Dallas Texas
right
have you ever been to Canada
um
uh-huh
uh that's supposed to be really cold weather in the winter that's why New York gets so cold because it's so close to Canada
uh-huh
goodness
uh-huh
was it snow- snowing
um
you know uh Christmas really doesn't seem like Christmas to me unless i do see the snow and the ice
it uh it's just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights not necessarily not the ice i should kee- leave the ice out of it but the snow is real pretty
uh-huh
i rem- i know one Christmas when i was in Dallas it sn- it snowed and and there was a white Christmas but i don't
i guess it's been about five or six years ago
um-hum
yeah
i just think it's really really pretty
i remember one Christmas here it was sixty degrees [laughter] that was so strange to me having lived in New York you know
yeah
yeah and people drive like the s- street is dry
yeah
i don't think TI's closed down in a couple of years for bad weather
oh
i look forward to one of those days [laughter]
not
now that's true [laughter] d- you say you work in Plano
oh you do i do too
did i get what
two days ago
uh i know it sprinkled some
uh-huh
i believe it it it uh [noise] it rained at night or something because i saw puddles of water outside but i did-
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
well March is th- the month for high winds
and it's been rather windy here too
uh-huh have you heard the forecast for the week coming up
yeah i haven't either yeah it's probably going to start getting summer
hot [laughter]
yeah
well that's nice
oh you plant oh
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
[noise] yeah
well it probably they'll probably do okay now i have a friend that's planted some uh
planted a garden some things like collard greens and cabbage
and uh they're coming up really pretty
you just need a just need a good rain [noise]
um-hum
yeah
yeah well i live in an apartment so the only thing i grow are plants inside and i don't do v- very well with those i think the temperature in here [vocalized-noise]
yeah but i guess i just don't know what i'm doing [laughter]
sometimes i- i'd sit the plants outside on the patio an- and i'd forget about them and it gets too hot out there an- and they you know
burn up and so forth that's happened to quite a few of my plants
yeah
um-hum
uh uh-huh
well good i hope hope it's nice too
yeah
i hope it's as nice as it was today
seems like it was extra cold last night though
but i know it was cold i had to turn on the heat an- get quilts yeah
yeah
uh-huh
you know the summer really starts in Dallas tha- i remember one one year seems like it started about the end of February yeah hot
um-hum
yeah but it up in New York it's cold till about June
um
yeah one thing about the snow in March i- a- at least it'll melt it melts quickly up there
that's true [laughter]
[laughter] i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music and they're none of them are recent right
so i like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is [laughter] and the Moody Blues and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson
yeah
but not all country i don't like that when they start i don't know i just like Willie Nelson i guess because he's such a character
[laughter]
yeah [noise]
[laughter] my truck is broken down
yeah and there there's a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano i think he's dead now [laughter] but he plays wonderfully
i like that
very badly i've got a piano [laughter] my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons
and i was [noise] the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me and it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it it is real relaxing
yeah
oh so do i forgot about that i said so do i i forgot about jazz
yes we've got about five of those i love them
uh-huh i'd never heard them before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it
yeah
i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can jus- see the things that they're trying to show with music my my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the
the pieces that have that person
you know on it huh i mean i don't even know who did which ones but he does
yeah
were you in the band
so was i
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
i like the Moody Blues
did you like them
so what type [vocalized-noise] Simply Red i've never heard of that
is it just instrumental
yeah
yeah
well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we're going to go to Commerce and see a friend and then i'm going to go to Sulphur Springs yeah where are you
okay so we're in Garland
yeah
yeah yeah just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else
for colleges
well they're not c-
they're not going to recruit me anymore i'm through [laughter] no more for me wh- what do you do
are you going to go to East Texas for that
that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial
this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June
and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed
well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman
this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh
getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced
yeah
th- the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen
hopefully [laughter]
yeah
the death [noise] penalty
no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody
[noise] you know
uh-huh
yeah but then when you're uh when you're picked see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it's so hard because you know
everybody is wanting to go on an- and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh so you like [vocalized-noise] a a variety sort of easy listening because y- you like country but then
um
oh uh-huh yeah i- i like some of his songs though they're they're not so
they're not so sad country all the time they're just kind of sweet sometimes you know i mean they're not th- the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know [laughter]
yeah my truck's broken down and my house just burned down you know but
no
uh-huh
are d- you do you play the piano is or you just like it
[laughter] yeah
[laughter]
yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be
that'd be kind of fun i think
[laughter] because i mean i play the flute and
not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so
but um i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the wh- when i i don't play i like jazz music but [noise]
what's that
what's that
yeah i like a lot like i like uh th- the New Age music like with um uh the um um i don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection
yeah i love those too they're just so relaxing
yeah
yeah
isn't that nice i mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know and uh
i- i- it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it uh it's mostly relaxing and you don't uh because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like
[vocalized-noise] there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or but uh
yeah
yeah
yeah oh okay i see what you're saying yeah
i i can't identify them either i just like them i couldn't i know which ones come next but i don't even know their names most of them i don't know their names of the song but i i can identify them but i like that and i like um
course i- i like classical music and uh
i was in the band yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so
i'm used to pieces i- a- and i played classical flute i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that so i c- i can relate to it i suppose but uh
and i like i'm like you [noise] i like the older stuff too because i like Chicago and i like i like um uh
let me think who
um i like Hebert um oh you don't know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws is a flute player he's a jazz flute player and i like um
uh Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is yeah i like Chuck Mangione i'm trying to think of all um
uh what's his name plays the trumpet
um
yeah yeah i like Moody Blues i- i like mostly the older groups i think
oh [vocalized-noise] but we do have i like Simply Red we got Simply Red i thinking of all our CD's that we have what i really like and uh
i like Breeze i like the group i think just because they all sort of sound they sound l- a lot like r- uh Simply Red if i'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that's it's easy in listening
um
no it's it's got people singing but [noise] it's it is instrumental but it's it's got people singing but it's got a like a whole bunch of people singing you know um [vocalized-noise] how many people are in [vocalized-noise]
on he can't hear me i- i don't remember how many people but it's it's got me- men and women and it's not
it's it's nice i mean it's pleasant you know music it's not what's it hurts your ears to hear it but it's not as it's not like uh Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it
you know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything
yeah
[laughter]
oh you must live in this area
we're in Sherman
oh okay you're going to Commerce for East Texas or something oh okay
oh okay well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas that's why i was just wondering yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area
[laughter] no more huh [laughter]
well right now i'm just a homemaker but i'm going to school uh for legal assistant and that's why i know so and uh just nothing basically
no no i- uh no i don't go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but i'm really interested in legal [vocalized-noise] you know in the legal environment but i don't want to be a lawyer so i said well i think i'll go back to school and
see about being a legal assistant [noise] so
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's how it works
and this is the man that was in front of you oh well they'll weed him out [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jur- the jury
you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know an- and know some of the different things about it but um
th- they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime an- and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all so but
yeah so see there there they would have a doubt about you th- you know because if that's what if that's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you're always going to say
you know not gui- you- you're not going to want to have them have that cri- uh that punishment so
uh-huh
well especially with something where you have to f- you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about
[noise]
what do you think about um
the way the criminal justice system handles trials
[noise]
yeah
uh-huh [noise]
yeah
[noise]
yeah
yeah
well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of
you know and held over for trial
yeah i don't know i- i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however
yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it y- give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong
or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could
um-hum
it's not so much that i that
i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges what bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything
someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know th- the parole system uh it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior
no it's not
um-hum
oh i think they're all overcrowded
they've uh i think i heard Fort Worth that uh
they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowd- they're not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do
well no i mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates
so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you know
there
yeah
um-hum something that is working and i- i- i really like the system of house arrest
where uh a someone's wear someone wears a bracelet
like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed i mean th- some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time
they're instructed uh
so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts
and uh
they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house
and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it
so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well that's a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while
they're
you know paying back for whatever crime they've committed
oh yeah
yeah
um-hum i've i've really i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it but
w- something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail
and they have a job in jail and they work
that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes
i mean they're in jail for crying out loud what do they need cigarettes for
um-hum
um-hum
oh i think that's a wonderful idea
more than that more than that
i know
the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them they're working when they get out of jail they get handed all that money
that really ticks me off i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages
should go like i don't know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board
[vocalized-noise] figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year
and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money
to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that they've earned while they're in prison
should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with
exactly absolutely that's the part that i really think we need to change
has nothing right
absolutely
yeah
um-hum i think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah in some cases tha- i- it would work that way in some cases it would work the other way
the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time
uh-huh
yeah i think that's probably a much fairer way
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
it might be more it m- would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it
the thing that i- i don't really like i- i don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a
[noise]
well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers
but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say
the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income
to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen
okay now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven
okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it
ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then there's another thing that i disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve
and i don't know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that
okay i see
okay
i don't know much about the Grand Jury how do you feel about the in Texas i noticed since i've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial
well we know there's a few out there
um-hum
yeah it's
yeah would be pretty hard well i don't think you know i don't think that
if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be
and i think it's not only that it's a waste of our money we have to have a trial for this person then two weeks down the road we have to sente- sentence
excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again and that's more money spent
no
and it's not working either
it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders i know i don't know how you all are there where you're at but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded we just built a brand new one two years ago
and it's overcrowded
so now they start turning them loose
they turn them loose
yeah
well the way i- it seems the way it's been working here's
go ahead
it seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life
yeah they [vocalized-noise]
yeah and they
they keep
yeah
all right
all right
yeah it would allow th-
yeah instead of being completely penned up
and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock
and that would give you know at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people
sometimes it's pretty messed up isn't it
um-hum
yeah
[noise] well see and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like and there's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong i came from California
and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang and they clean the city parks
and they clean the city streets but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much
and they're not you know they're not doing anything to support themselves while they're there
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well
um-hum see now i also believe in
yeah
yeah to help
yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
and something else that i would
and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement
you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and they're working they're getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no
no uh
regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect
but it's
but i sure don't i- i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself there that
yeah beca- well th- see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure there's
maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge d- just doesn't care you committed this crime so i'm just going to throw the book at you whereas the jury may have a little
shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it
yeah in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you you know two to three years and then
yeah
well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there they have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in th- at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and you'd have more than one person's input on it
and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence
and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty but i don't have to deal with it from here
you know so the judge takes care of all of that
yeah it would uh s- yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more respo- you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person
[noise]
so what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or
Bengals
yeah
uh i w- uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl
[laughter]
two years ago was it
yeah i- i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win
anybody who plays the 49ers really
yeah
yeah that's true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders
yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was
and uh i pretty much like them ever since that
and they haven't they haven't produced since then but
but
least i've stuck with them i'm loyal
yeah
yeah what other teams uh do you like up there
or do you not watch much football
oh really
every Sunday and Monday
oh that's right
yeah me neither it's kind of like they they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time
did you know that they're playing a game today
yeah
they're playing it right now
yeah i think it's uh ABC that's carrying it [vocalized-noise] it's either ABC or NBC one or the other i think i'm not too sure one of the major stations it's uh Barcelona versus New York
yeah the temperature's just not right
yeah
we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season
but it takes a good while for it to get cold
but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm
and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina
and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland
so the coast was completely [vocalized-noise] we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year
yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else
and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow
and so i mean i- i had never done that before and it's it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah
yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow
yeah
but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it
you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true
well right now we're having nice weather i- i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now
yeah especially at this time
yeah is it very windy up there now
yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been up been with us all day
well
yeah this is the first time i've talked with someone up north really mostly i've been talking with people in Texas
seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas [laughter]
yeah nice talking to you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i uh i'd have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals
um-hum
oh that was sad wasn't it
yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago
[laughter]
yeah well uh it's kind of hard to uh to know what to do with some of these teams and they're either extremely strong or very very weak and uh nothing much in between
oh you like the Raiders
um-hum
uh-huh
no [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh well that that and that's the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is is in the supporting them
and staying with it and hoping that uh you know the next time is a better time around
well um
oh i love football
oh watch it uh e- every game that's on i watch uh
yeah and Thursday nights [laughter]
[laughter]
no there uh
well let's see i never use thought about football too much yet uh
yeah right uh uh
yeah that's the World League
yeah what time is that supposed to be
oh are they
oh
hum well uh
i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer f- from the the the World League
yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather
rather than just be played at a- anytime during the year
um-hum
huh
ooh
uh-huh
oh is that right
yeah
[laughter]
is that right
huh
i would think uh that if you were real cold and you hit uh hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more
well that helps doesn't it [laughter]
oh yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah right right
[noise]
what kind of weather you having right now
oh my well our weather's suddenly turned cold again uh our weather is so unstable
you never know
yes and uh this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before uh before i got out of church it cooled off again
so much so that i uh stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and uh the coat i had on was just too light in weight
yes very strong winds
well been awfully nice talking with you
[laughter]
yeah right right most people seem to be there out there
right [laughter]
okay well good talking to you
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay the topic that we have Victoria again as I mentioned was
what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess
if i were to look at with four grown children and having been th- all four of them through public schools and colleges
i guess the public school system i would have to say is that
we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more
we need to we need to probably
try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could
and the other thing was we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here
and it's too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with with real
um you know young young kids i'm talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old
drug problems
[vocalized-noise] go ahead i'm sorry
uh-huh
yeah i lived i lived that's just outside of Washington i lived in Fairfax county that was really really a nice nice area down there and
my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and
they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess
ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time
and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with with TI with my job
and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better ed- education in Texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one
uh relationships with the with the uh the facility okay and and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if if that makes sense to you
and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and
but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost
well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it
oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and and it's so hard to compete and and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country
wanna go jumping into a an education field when the when there's you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level
and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but I think we should pay them a little more money
um they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don't really believe that i think it's a lot more than that
when you figure the hours and time they put into the school and stuff alright and even if is only a hundred and eighty days a year lets pay them for the hundred and eighty days a year i mean [vocalized-noise]
no no they [vocalized-noise] that's what i mean at one time we we used to able to carry that over to the kids of course i
i can see the teacher's point too where at at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i'll give this kid a little extra help or something
in the long run i think it would really be worth while
what what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you're finishing up this year huh
well that's great i i wish you all the best in in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing and it's good to talk to a a a student rather than
most of the folk i've talked to are are industrial people th- like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things
well i don't know what else we can do about this school situation Victoria and if there's anything else you'd like to add
you have a nice day and i'm going to say good bye for now and if you're ever up Rhode Island way around TI look me up it's Ray Smith at TI in Albrough Massachusetts
have a nice one Victoria and good luck in your future bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
exactly [laughter]
smaller classrooms possibly
exactly
i would [vocalized-noise] when i was in school um i was supposedly in one of the best school systems in the country in Fairfax county
and i'm i think back and i i don't feel like i i could have learned a lot more and don't feel like i learned as much
i've only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i've i worry about the children that are in
the other school systems that aren't as good um i don't know any particular ones but you know when [vocalized-noise] when they say one of the where i went to school was one of the best counties then i think [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i know um i know with um i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who've thought about
going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there's a lot of other things I can do and get a lot more money
uh-huh
exactly
and and i mean their their day doesn't end you know when schools out
uh-huh
i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day
i'm an interior design major
yep so
exactly in May
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
i think that's about it you too
alrighty you too thank you bye bye [noise]
[noise]
okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders
that's right across the country i don't think i could [laughter] i don't think i could
i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh
yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan
oh i see
uh-huh
i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they
they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the 49ers are about to do
i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh
sure
you're exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellow's name uh
Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death
and
yep but
they had nothing to back it up and
and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this
this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and
it's it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know
but i like uh i like the Giants i- i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure [laughter] they'll get away with it again but
they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like
yes
yes
i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i- i kind of well i- i guess that's the rules and
and the way the and the way the the play-offs are run but i
i don't know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but
i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i- i think
i'm not sure that they can repeat okay
yeah yeah
no
no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh
who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one
that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess
i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i w- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year
because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there
yeah Reicher or whate- Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing
and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course
i'm being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams [laughter]
course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad they're now they're talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them
but uh yeah they they really
i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and
i think they just could have handled it more professionally i- i- i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess
they've had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard
boy just kind of [laughter]
i've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when they're only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and
it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean y- after a while guys get tired and we just didn't go anymore so
yeah sure
but they played like professionals exactly right
yeah
yeah they they really didn't do good at all for us up here and that's that's too bad because they were they were some good play- they are some good players on the Patriots team you know and
i think they need to get rid of Grogan he's been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager
he is eventually
because he's been
he's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally
it's just their strength will beat him you know sometimes
sure of course no one does i'm sure they don't you know it was
that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper
is that right there's a there's a fabulous career
oh sure because they're they're tenure is real short
anytime at all yeah but ye- yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if he'll ever come back and play [vocalized-noise]
well i would have too i that's the s- that's that's i don't understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball
you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if you're not up for three innings or whatever but
yeah the key right there yeah
some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i- th- that's surprising i- i was i had not heard that in the in the
yeah they
no i'm i'm sure they p- well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip
may be a real problem but i- i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would
well Steve i'll tell you i think i still think Joe Montana's the best quarterback that ever handled a ball
and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or w- was better than than Joe Montana is now
because i of course [laughter] another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know [laughter] this is the black and blue league up here in the corner
but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him
he would be on par with
with Joe Montana
because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad
yeah that's a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fab- he he still is he's got a he's got a lot of years left in him
no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Den- simply because Denver is not not the
doesn't have enough depth i don't think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the 49ers
yeah that's that could be true too
yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win
yeah pardon me
oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans uh that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and
it's unreal the in-fighting it was it was just it's every day in the paper was like you know it was like a saga like a like a
like a soap opera it you know who's fighting with who who doesn't want to go out on the field who doesn't want to catch it's unreal i mean you know that that's really detrimental to the team
well Steve it's been nice talking with you
it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so
well like i say i- i guess i'll root for any football game because i really like the sport and i'm glad that was my topic today so
you uh you uh take care of yourself and if you're ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my name's Ray Smith and i work in building twelve
okay come on up bye-bye
[noise]
pro f-
okay
yes [laughter]
that's one end to the other that's true
yeah San Francisco i go with so
well i'm not originally from Dallas so uh i kind of i moved around a lot when i was well up until last year and uh so i've i've kind of picked teams all over the country
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think that's true
well the only thing that San Francisco may have done differently is that they've done a good job in the last few years of of getting rid of their older players and and bringing up n- a bunch of new people
you know
right
Campbell Earl Campbell
um-hum but it it worked for them but uh you're right they they kind of
exactly
um-hum
yeah that's right
well i think i got to agree with you there
they did a they had a excellent game in the Super Bowl uh i was real impressed but uh because
um-hum
um-hum
well as hard as it is to repeat anyway uh and as as close as i think the New York Giants were to the rest i mean
there really wasn't a a dominant team this year
and uh you know if if if like San Francisco was dominant for two years uh they had a you know they had a chance to but uh i don't think New York's going to be able to do that
right
they've got i mean they've got some excellent players uh
hum uh i might go with Bu- yeah
you know this may be really out on a limb but i might go with Buffalo as as good as they were toward the end of the year got into the Super Bowl and just just missed
think they'll be hungry next year
yeah
Reich uh Reich or yeah
think it was
no
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah i can believe that
yeah well
[laughter]
yeah i think that's probably would be best for the area
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well losing is i mean i'm i'm originally from Saint Louis and Saint Louis Cardinals when they were there were uh a mostly a losing team but
th- exactly and and yeah they never they never did things to embarrass the town and that's what i think would be would be bad about New England
um-hum well that's true
well he's going to he's going to kill himself
he's going to end up paralyzing himself or something i mean i worry about that guy
oh yeah
yeah well the only thing that might save him is that in the backs of their minds they may think that they don't want to hurt him permanently
and so they may let up on him so i don't know
right right
well the last i heard i didn't read it in the paper but i heard it on TV was that they were still saying that he's out permanently you know yeah
yeah well they were they were talk- i think i was watching uh the NCAAs and they were talking about uh you know this is one reason they say that
that athletes get the money as quickly as they can you know get all the money th- you know
right and it could end at anytime
you know it was weird when i what i read in the paper was
uh the
uh
the the baseball career was over permanently the football career might not be and i don't understand that i would have thought it was the other way around
especially yeah i mean
yeah um-hum
and you don't get hit
[laughter]
or you're not supposed to anyway
that's right
it it may have been a misquote but that's sure what i got
oh yeah
yeah i was i- i was kind of surprised that uh that the Royals let him go with a football career as long as they did you know
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
well that's uh i agree with you there i mean he didn't have the surrounding cast that Montana had there's no doubt about that
i don't think he'll do it in Denver though
i'm not even yeah
well i think it's it's not only depth i don't think that they've got the spirit or whatever to go out and get the people to support him i mean
yeah the coaching staff seems i mean they were they were fighting each other coaching staff and Elway and
oh yeah that did it to New England a couple years ago didn't it
didn't it do that to New England a couple years ago
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah
yeah it has
[laughter]
yeah it worked out real good
you too
all right i will
all right
y- you take care bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh books
mainly i read the Bible these days
[laughter]
good that's great to hear uh and Christian literature uh i've kind of i used to read a lot of uh novels
but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading
and i i been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has it's getting to where a just really want to read it
do you
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
right
have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's
uh This Present Darkness and uh uh
i forget the t- the other well he uh he's also written a lot of children how old is your daughter
five okay he's written some children's books as well and they're all spiritually uh oriented yeah uh
Frank E Peretti P E R E T T I
uh-huh yeah do because uh i love to read his his uh children's [noise] books just [laughter]
yeah oh they're good they're great and it's uh like uh uh usually about a family of um
archeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods
[vocalized-noise]
yeah it is it's real exciting
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know so
uh-huh
well it's hard for me
[laughter]
uh-huh
i know it and and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats [laughter]
uh-huh that's right
uh-huh yeah i've read a lot of his too
yeah can't put them down [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh yeah
uh there's another guy
oh what can what is his name
oh durn [laughter] you would well you know when you're recording you can't re- remem- uh
oh Dean uh Kratz or Kranz or
y- who

uh follow for her you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the Bible to her she'd [laughter] never understand any of it
that's right
it is it is real hard to to follow and understand and
uh
i've got a Bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are that's that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who [laughter]
yeah

yeah
right
right
a lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays
i know it's it's really hard for me i work two jobs and
uh have my daughter and teach Sunday school and go to school myself so it's it's hard for me to
sit down and read but when i do i just
just love it
[noise]
i think we have too thank you very much you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay so you watch L- David Letterman
well see our favorite TV show i i i live in a dorm and our favorite TV show is Cheers
okay well we try it like here they show it like every day
and then like on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on
but we watch it like every day but i like late night we don't watch uh what we do is we stay up -til around one thirty and then they show the Twilight Zone at one thirty
and so we just stay and watch that
the what
yeah
i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned
yeah it was really it was really
oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but
but uh so what what do you like why do you like David Letterman
so the
wait did you watch Saturday Night Live what he's got what
hey i got long hair w- wait [laughter]
uh i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair
and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what
he goes do you want to dance i go no no he goes oh oh i'm sorry i go yeah you better be i go you better be so
but okay so d- wait do you watch Saturday Night Live yesterday
yeah
no oh you missed Wayne's World Wayne's World was pretty cool
so uh let's see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV
because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know
what
yeah
[laughter]
well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework so it really didn't matter [laughter]
[noise]
yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too [laughter]
[laughter]
so uh let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring
yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know
yeah i know
and and in North C- see the the the thing is [vocalized-noise] like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know
it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know
so but uh let's see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek
okay well i used to hate Star Trek
i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it
but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind
because what happened is [vocalized-noise] like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like
the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes [vocalized-noise] sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time -til we do and then and then we watch football
which basketball
college or
well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there
we got Duke and North Carolina
but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday
uh they go s- some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right
i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching TV and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf
and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes
because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit
okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play
and that's it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's it's like that i mean it's was it's just
but when i went home that's all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my God and TV in Argentina's really bad
uh because um i wanted to go to school here
yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there
so and i also uh my father works for IBM and we came up here we well we came to the United States in nineteen seventy six seventy seven
and uh we lived here for about seven years then we moved back and so then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college
he goes okay so he goes but do it fast so i did my undergraduate in two years yeah
so but it's [vocalized-noise] it's just you know oh well we've been talking for five minutes that's the only obligation we have
and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks
okay
all right nice talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
yeah
uh-huh
oh really yeah that's pretty awesome too i watch it every now and then that's hilarious
oh serious
oh that's cool
uh-huh
[laughter]
Twilight Zone rules man Twilight Zone rules

really uh kind of annoying but that's cool
kind of annoying to like in front of TV like trying to do homework you know
trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like
In Living Color or something i don't know
cool yeah BS that's the way to do it
[laughter]
cool yeah works for me
no unless
i watched through the war you know there's only one
[laughter]
i know i guess they think that people don't watch TV but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over
it's like oh man
yeah
oh
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
uh i haven't seen it in years but i used to
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]

oh that's cool how long did you live there
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
huh
[laughter]
that's cool
[laughter]
oh really awesome
that's cool
groovy
yeah no doubt
okay
yeah you too
bye
[noise]
[noise] okay
um-hum kind of like a domino's effect
no
no no
um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it
or within i think people just started
you know no- not being as careful with the loans that they were making
whenever
y- you know whenever they gave them out
i think maybe they didn't check into them enough
or maybe because everyone else was doing it they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so
yeah
um-hum um-hum
um-hum [noise]
[noise] i'm not sure
um-hum i know well [laughter] i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion
and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it
no i don't think so
and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make
and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make
and i think if they would be more bound
to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened
um-hum
um
[noise] i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it wasn't making it wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still a- you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile
no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big [vocalized-noise] you know how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open
and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this
um-hum
um-hum
i- i don't know i thin- i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it
um-hum
[noise] oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just rea- i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back
you know and they just they just wrote it right off
i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back
um-hum
um-hum yeah because we- we're you know we're talking about some companies that have just
like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more
they just totally wrote it off their book
hum
um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing
um it it's just it's just for you know safe purposes
you know in case something would happen um
yeah [vocalized-noise] as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something
um-hum
right
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
i think it could happen yeah
um-hum
i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again
because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future
but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans because i mean you're gonna have to take some risks
and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance of it [vocalized-noise] possibly happen again but not until you know late you know in the future
um-hum
[noise]
all right
uh feelings on what caused the S and L
crisis
[noise] i guess i don't
have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where
loan were made that appear to be
a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during
the Reagan eight years
uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued
right i- i don't have a a field for whether or not
this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome
uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever
uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years
where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since
of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour
maybe
uh-huh
yeah
it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people
making loans and business decisions
on a
get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but
if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making
business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or
i- i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move
you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on
or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i
i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing [laughter]
it
okay
well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk
oh okay
uh-huh
okay
well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and
nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up
it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your sense that that we now understand how bad it is
or is there more to be heard yet
so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet of the problem or whether it [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
to be caught in the land slide
do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the the regular banks
it seems that i recall reading for the last
oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks
of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela
uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south
resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done
the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans
i have this vague since that that could happen
that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
um-hum
and so you think that it's just gone
okay
do you think it is necessary to have the
federal guaranty program
like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors
which i don't think is what it was meant to do
so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected
the possibility exists for for these sorts of
of problems
um
so your since is that the
that uh the
the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money
and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected
and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of
of dollars being protected
it it seems like um [noise] there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts
uh it's if if you take
ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred bi- billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts
and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's
and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought
you know that the for
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got
accounts in thirty five different S and L's or
thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was [laughter] intended to be the issue there
uh-huh
i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means means i'm not worried enough
uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things
uh-huh
well perhaps if there are regulatory
um
constraints put back in place
it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
uh [vocalized-noise]
[noise] do you are you on a regul- regular exercise program right now
[laughter]
oh well i'm kind of off and on
right now i'm kind of off
okay what type of exercise do you do
okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much
you find that uh to be boring
yeah
well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
but i
yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on TV
it's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now
i used to jog somewhat
uh-huh well that's good yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when i go visit them uh i'll get on that thing every now and then
um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something
i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day
but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a a program up consistently
no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two
yeah it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on
have to have the right type of uh shoes too that's very important
but
yeah i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don't get very much use [laughter]
uh-huh
ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program
so i'll i'll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that an- maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week
but uh that gets old too in a very short order i'm i'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh
uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
yeah
so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program
i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going
uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine
lifting weights and uh working out like that [noise]
and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
i found that to be uh very helpful
uh i need to i haven't started yet but [laughter] it's a thought
sounds like something i should do
uh-huh
how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking
okay how far about how far do you go walking
okay
yeah that's good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging
it
sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
but it's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is
um-hum [noise] do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV
okay which uh shows do you watch on TV
oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda [noise]
okay
right i w- every every now and then i'll watch uh ESPN i i get cable on TV and they have uh a couple of shows called Basic Training and um what is the other one called
uh-huh
Bodies In Motion that's that's the name of the one i was thinking of
with Gil Janklowicz
yeah well he's he's he he he's not bad and his assistants usually aren't either [laughter]
they're always in in in Hawaii someplace on on the on the beach
yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday
yeah every morning
it's on ESPN uh at what time i can't remember what time
it's uh
-ell i can't remember offhand what time
they have that show on
yeah every now and then
[noise] um-hum
[noise] well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday
Monday through Friday
case you're interested in that
[noise] i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there but uh i haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that i made
so i'm kind of bad about that myself
[laughter] okay well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness
so all right good night bye
[noise]
yes and i hate it [laughter] how about you
off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've um
had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off
uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics
not [vocalized-noise] not really
y- yeah and time consuming i mean it's
it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year [laughter]
hum-um
[laughter] yeah a lot of things do that i have a neg- i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill [noise]
yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse
yeah i can't ride a bike so
oh
yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend
uh
you had any injuries from jogging
i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body a- and that you know
you can end up getting hurt worse [noise]
um-hum
yeah that's not quite so so easy yeah yeah
i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts
[laughter] well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months
so
[laughter]
yeah
yeah well don't let it collect dust you
least exercise while dusting it off
well [noise]
yeah that that'll be good
um-hum
oh
um-hum
so are you gonna do that
[laughter]
well that sounds like something good to do then
yeah
nice way to start off the spring
get back in shape
well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics
[noise] well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i jus- surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i tr- try to workup to three miles
yeah it takes it's ju- tha- it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but
my walkman broke so i'm upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud
yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it [noise]
no i- i just do it on TV i have a cassette
um it's j- a it's a ta- i use tapes
Ri- or Richard Simmons [laughter] [noise] Sweating to the Oldies [laughter]
uh-huh
there was one guy i used to watch on ESPN i don't know if he's still on it anymore or not i don't i don't know if i get ESPN or not
but um well yeah i used to watch o- watch one on the air but that was back
that was yeah
yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute [laughter]
[laughter] but uh
yeah yeah but then that was back when um you know the high impact and
do they are the- yeah ok- they're so they're still he's still doing it then huh oh i'll have to tune in [laughter]
i'll have to check it check check it back up then b- the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body
i haven't watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so
i'll have to okay thanks
now that's a thought
[laughter] well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that [vocalized-noise]
[noise] well they're gonna beep us pretty soon
[noise] uh-huh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye
[noise]
why do i think so few people vote i
i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um
for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people
figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal
um and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact
and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our
minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back
and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin
um and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go
the way that it didn't go
but they also had very low voter turnouts especially like in the Hispanic community
and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system
and so they've chosen not to participate in it
and i think that's part of it
what do you think
oh
i've i've heard people say that i know it's it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference
as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them that they don't want to have any say
in uh politics
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
well
last November was my first election in Dallas i've only lived in Dallas a little over a year
and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for
and
i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet
and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here
so what's the point in voting for these people i- i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board
um-hum
yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the candidate rather than his uh
job performance issues
um-hum
yeah
i'd i'd say
yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young voters that don't know what the Railroad Commission does
and so they go you know w- who who what does it matter who i vote for
i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices than any place i've ever been
well a lot more confusion you know i i- in other towns i've never been called upon to decide all this long list of judges i've never been called upon to decide
you know [vocalized-noise] we're we're voting for Railroad commissioner and and uh Land commissioner and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor
we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject
well it does
um-hum
but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
th- th- the big problem i guess with the mass media is you know
uh you don't have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and [vocalized-noise] soak the message in
i mean anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less they're not going to care about it
or or if you can't dramatize it and put it on Unsolved Mysteries then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it
uh the the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line
it w- it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly
worth it to me i think
i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest
uh-huh
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
hum
so you have to go a little out of your way huh
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah i would also like better
information on
on what on you know what am i voting on and and who some just general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers
and i didn't see much of it
like you know i s- you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on
as far as you know what what is the duties of this political office and uh and what are the characteristics or wh- what are the
issued statements and
uh spoken goals of the uh candidates
i'd like to get
yeah
um-hum
yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of
better informed decisions
but still uh
you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct
uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my congressman last fall didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice
and i think uh
in some districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it
that uh you know why vote when it's decided already
that sort of attitude
yeah
well we used the five minutes up
okay
all right bye
why do you think so few people vote then
um-hum
um-hum
what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that don't want to be called for
jury duty or or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother
hum
okay and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections uh even down to the uh school board type uh elections i guess there are so many
that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in
um-hum
[laughter] right
well it's a shame that uh that even the politician who wants to give give out good information about himself
uh has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side
such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information
uh and then once you get off the candidate's personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that
there's there's very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things you'd like to know about a candidate and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it weren't true to begin with [laughter] so
i would say that it's much easier to deal with the the the public the uh media that's that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet
than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can
listen to either side of a given issue
uh and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that T- uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know
right
right
so hence more apathy [laughter] i guess or confusion
um-hum
hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
yeah a lot more appointee's i guess makes him carry a lot more weight
that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together
so hum
um-hum
right
do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in
did you go early in the morning or
after work
hum that's interesting
well wh- in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we
i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in in line
and i wait longer to to watch them set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down Central and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were
because normally i'm i'm at work before seven so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote
uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our city wants to vote on
they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles
so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here
and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here
and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want
um-hum
um-hum
right
probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular
uh Railroad Commission for instance does
if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened
you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small publication that uh
uh League of Women Voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that
um-hum
right
that's true
with so many elected officials i guess there's just so many people to go around [laughter] in some of those cases
hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go
yeah at least [laughter] bye
okay capital punishment oh i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion
uh-huh
applied at all
well i ju- i just feel like
there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know
yes yes not
getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years
there has that's right
uh-huh
yeah yeah
uh-huh
that's right that's honestly right
they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways
you know
but they sure are just
because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance
you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
time uh-huh
yes i just i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole
you know
uh-huh
um-hum yeah you get it back yeah
yeah
but it's
i- i know yeah
same thing yes
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] uh a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know thank goodness but still i- it could
yes
uh-huh
and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is you know i- i haven't kept up you know anything like that
uh-huh
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes the victim is really
seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness
uh-huh
uh-huh
or you know plead insanity
you know [laughter] and a lots of things
oh yes i think ye- uh-huh
yes i
it just just doesn't make sense i just
uh-huh
uh-huh well like i said i live in a small place you know
but uh
[noise] even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now i'm raising children
it ju- it really is
uh-huh
see them yep
yeah [noise] it really is well we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon but i've enjoyed talking to you
[noise] bye okay bye-bye
[noise]
in the way that it's applied or that it's applied at all
so i how do you feel that it should be applied
and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced
yes
that's i agree with that completely i know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people
because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and
how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars
and it's
well they certainly are living off our ex- at our expense
i didn't
yes
um-hum
and and be paroled and and have served the sentence that's what that's what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in
cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to
you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something
and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out
even if if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something
yeah
i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesn't
you know i- it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective
there's [noise] should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is what's going to happen
and i mean it sounds horrible it i i hear myself saying this and
but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed
and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system
and it's like i said at our expense
yes
i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that
something
really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens
yeah
i think i think Texas is wha- Texas the southern states seem to be
somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know California had it for a long time and then they um took it off the books they repealed it
and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison
and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty
for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson who's come up
you know it's been denied fortunately but
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death
and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California reverked revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know
it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people
um-hum
yeah
and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior [vocalized-noise] criminal history you know where he's raped ten women
and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't find anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again
and so they say well this is you know i- i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal
yeah well
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too
they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again
i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in in the Dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself
and i- i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in Texas and it wasn't that way when i was younger
we could go around and boy
yes ever you can't even
when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them
um-hum [noise]
well good talking to you too bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay so what are your opinion on it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
n- not much i'm twenty eight so no i really don't remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right
i was born in sixty two so when did it end
yeah
so i was ten and i don't remember a lot about
anything at that time in my life very much in great detail
no i didn't
but i- i did read the book i ha- do have i have six years of college
so i did read and study about the Vietnam War though so i am pretty fa- you know i'm more familiar with it than
mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that
i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there
and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on
i don't i don't know i don't really i'm tired of pacifist though see on the other hand
i'm a pac- i'm really struggling with it i'm a pacifist physical pacifist i'm a Christian
and i believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms
and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so
in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying
i don't think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
still have a problem with uh you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but
and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but
you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you
i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and
and then shoot them
you so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord and i will pay
so i think God ultimately in charge of
what goes on in i know like Mao Tse Chung in China he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and he's gonna be accountable for them
and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he
he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China
because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing
and that now he build roads so then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that
now you see what i mean it's like now
uh-huh
well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also
so if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them right
is that right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah but then again yeah i'd say it is wrong to invade Kuwait and i'm not saying President Bush made the wrong decision i think i'm lacking in my
i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the Vietnam War because i'm going to interpret that
through the Bible and i've kind of always i have been a Christian five years and i've kind of avoided that
that those the war things and how God approaches that
because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel
right
right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah
i know
but then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them bless them you know
and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like
but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it
would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you
what can we do to rectify this situation
and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldn't
because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because
if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because those are that's
the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory
um-hum
no well i believe personally i ho- i [laughter]
this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that
and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes
and just say i bind you in Jesus name your [vocalized-noise] i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on
and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal
there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that
do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein
but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe
means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things i- [vocalized-noise] i don't have a problem with uh
national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this
but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and
[noise]
well let me preface it i'm a i was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty nine and seventy
and i'm in active reserve now so
uh i'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have
um
it's it was an interesting
in that i think that he gave the American people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians
uh i are you old enough to remember the war
yeah uh
well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and
and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame
i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf
well they
well
what what's your perspective on it
yes
well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers
and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether it's in a uh you know Chicago or
uh or or Dallas i- i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley W- Price hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injustice in Iraq and Kuwait
the difficult i point is is to where do we step in and and i think that we
that's that's the part i have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your
when you're looking at Vietnam and you say well
is fifty eight thousand lives worth it
and i don't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives
well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles
how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy
if your brother or your sister were being beaten
by the authorities do we step in well
in some cases we would and i- i think that's what makes it so difficult
but
yeah but but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep
and the question is who are my sheep
and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry
but
yes uh they did the
i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes
and the question is who was he going to pay it to
uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i
i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there and and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our
in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and
and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would
that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and napalm them you know if
and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when Schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we l- we learned a lot from Vietnam
now it was it was it was in general bad but and i don't know the problem is now i'm i'm concerned a little bit that that now that the Gulf War is on that we're going to think it was a good war and it was okay
to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that [laughter] whether there's a connection there but
in any event
well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land
that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's
and
and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to Heaven we're going to ask God [laughter]
why did you do it that way
what do you
yeah
well and i- i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted
what do you do turn the other cheek
yeah
[noise]
well the problem we're having down here in public schools is is financing for one thing
uh and and the uh
the tax districts they're in the process of of rearranging the tax tax districts
and uh some of the more rich schools are those are those schools that are financially well off are going to have to support those that aren't
especially in the minority n- neighborhoods
and uh there's a lot of problems with that
a lot of debate going on with that
yeah restructuring
right right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's a problem down here it's uh
uh not no not too well
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think uh someone that really wanted it
or i really don't unders- or i guess i do understand people that i guess that want to teach teach it's
it must be inborn in them or something because they're certainly not going into it for the for the money nor the prestige or whatever
yeah
yeah
yeah
i think one thing too that's hurting the teachers
as far as recruiting teachers is that the uh
they've lost a lot of their their authority
in the classroom
[vocalized-noise]
well i mean uh they
no more punishment per se
i i'm speaking mostly of elementary
uh
you know it's
if some if a teacher
does anything that uh they're liable to have a law suit against them for
for uh cruel and unjust punishment or whatever
it's uh
and of course you've got the drugs and the other problems that you were much more prevalent than when i was going to school
yeah
yeah
yeah
and uh also you know this is purely my
my thoughts because i am i'm a Christian and i think when they took prayer out of school that uh
uh
i think it hurt
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
and
yeah yeah i do too but uh
yeah
well i- i believe in freedom of but not freedom from
if you understand what i mean
right
but uh we've like i say we've been redistricting here in Dallas has been a a major issue for i guess the last year
yeah they uh
they the voters voted one way and it
and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes
and the city council is divided over what the district should be because
they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation [vocalized-noise] representation
and uh it it's just a big battle
but uh
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah and also
the cost of it you know not not not great not uh public school but i can't imagine having to
raise a kid now and and have to look to college
uh in the next you know fifteen years or so later they go it's going up
yeah
yeah
yeah i- i just don't see how a person could
could put enough away enough money out of their paychecks to pay for our kids schooling within fifteen years
yeah
yeah
yeah most kids is probably just going to have to do what i did
either course the service i'm at i don't think gives a education uh after service
yeah
but uh that's how i got m- my education such as it was was going into it is service and then
coming back coming out in three years and
getting uh two years paid for
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay and i'm i'm glad to have met you oh are you [vocalized-noise] with Texas Instruments
oh okay i was wondering
i guess this is not just Texas Instruments wide
cause i worked for Tex- Texas Instruments that that's
[noise]
so what do you think of uh public schools today
uh
so they can't decide
um
oh
and and and the restriction is it sort of
sort of scr- screwing around with whoever is getting what money to what school
yeah [noise] we actually don't have we have we're having some problems of our own up here with teachers
but um we are we are apparently i'm i'm fairly new to Rochester i've only been here a cou- a few years
and we are supposedly Rochester public schools are are one of the model
the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country
they have very specific programs that um
that are being implemented at the moment that everybody is watching
you know to make sure that they're all they're all working and uh
for instance they have a mentor teacher program where um
there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go around and and help other teachers learn how to teach
and things like that but they're having a lot of problems here because um
because they also pay the teachers i think much better than others places in the country
they they pay them well
oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers
but they're having a large problem negotiating contracts they have been in con- they have been without a contract i believe for over six months
or something like six months
and they are now putting in you know some sort of federal arbitrator i think or something because they just have a horrible time getting the
you know getting their contracts straightened out
they have been good and they only walked out once or twice i believe they keep getting you know they th- they'll go all the way to your table they'll have some proposal and then
someone won't like it for some reason or some of them will say vote it down and it just goes
but
yeah so that that's [vocalized-noise]
that that's always i'm i'm actually i'm a PhD student at the moment
and um it's always occurred to me that that um
you know i mean so looking at it s- all so i have some bias in this
but it but it's always seemed to me that that that those people who
should be paid the most i think or paid sig- you know significantly more are are teacher types because they sort of hold more of the future in our hands than almost anyone else yet
yet i don't think that uh it it it's being done
i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're lacking in some very specific areas
that that need to be worked on i will
yeah
how wha- do what do you mean by that
oh yeah
um-hum
that's true that's true
but well i think that
yeah i think actually in any there are some places where some teachers are just afraid to teach you know are they going to
or they go to work where they're just baby sitters i think rather than teachers you know they're job is to make sure that
no kids get killed in their classroom for that day and
nobody else get's out so it's hard to imagine a
you know i mean i- i- i can't imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student
i'd be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the day and just being happy
so i- i sit back that the that's one of the main things that sort of happens to be sure up you know in or educational system maybe
[laughter] do that means you have to have a
metal detector and and uh outside the school or something
i'm not sure
well possibly i think it does um
i'm not sure i think it does some uh
it it it it may sort of lead to some
uh it it it may just be another form of sort of regimenting you know in kids which i which i think is good actually to have some kids sort of sit together and
you know just say things and sort of do things together so possibly
possibly i think that um
uh i'm i'm i'm actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer
in school but i think some things might be a a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view
i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today
i w- would i would agree with you and uh
i think somewhat
although i do understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so i
so
i don't know how you resolve that you know
i also i mean i think that our i think that our schools look a lot worse nowadays
relative to schools sort of in other countries as well i mean sort of like compared to the Japanese school system
i was in a panel that would that addressed the issue of you know science and how our kids they're just very very far behind in science because
a lot of them just aren't going into it because they just don't know anything about it and how it's got to be upgraded now is all
[noise] i think so [vocalized-noise] you i- i- i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting
oh well hopefully they'll resolve it soon
well i hope it all works out
yeah i- i- i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and i've yet to have any so [laughter]
so [laughter] i'm not quite at home with the issues yet
but i'm sure i'll it will hit me a little harder in a couple of years
oh i can't even i can't imagine it
[laughter]
my only hope is that uh is that whatever i'm going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think
and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach
because that typically is very otherwise i can't imagine it
it would
no i
i- i don't i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education
um on a lot of financial aid and where i am now i'm i'm only in graduate school because they waive tuition and
they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never
be comfortable again
well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for
that's that's actually a great way i think i know i have lots of friends who are doing things like that
i think it's a great way i couldn't i'm actually deaf in one ear so they wouldn't take me
um but that is a real a real i mean that's a real good way to do it i think i think that you know [vocalized-noise] these people are sort of getting the money and doing something for it so
i think it's real good
anyway it's it's been it was nice meeting you
and
no i'm not i'm just like you a person on the uh phone
thing
oh no
[noise] well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um
wh- when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasn't a state income tax and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so [noise]
i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what i was accustomed to
well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax
and um we've always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so
i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your gro- groceries and
[noise] but i think i mean i i don't enjoy paying taxes and it's hard but um
i think that's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and [noise] excuse me and have
and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess
what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share
and um that makes you feel bad
right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didn't have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um
it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed [noise] he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people
are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax and that's not fair to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing
the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because
i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
oh no [laughter]
[laughter] uh-huh
[laughter]
um-hum
uh-huh
right
yes
um-hum
yes
well it is and um and sometimes i think um
well for myself that the income that we have we're paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind
this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated
um just by our society yet you know they don't pay you um
what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over and [noise] and um but some of the people that make
a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would i guess because i'm not one of them [laughter] i wish that they would um you know realize that they
they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else
in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the
uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes they've earned it and yes they've that's great they've you know had such great fortune here
but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else
um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that
because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we don't [laughter] the industry here is able to to um fund
the state because we have oil here and things i mean that's what i've always heard is that um
big boom
[noise] yeah there's something about um the industry in the state that um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had it's enough money it was really nice that they had uh
but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would ha- have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community
country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that
um-hum
yeah it's true and i'm you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um i'm
i'm comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but
i'm i- willing to pay for that for my children and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess i mean i'm not going to be the kind of person that's going to grumble about the taxes even though we're paying pretty high percentage um
i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and
and not anyway well [laughter] i guess i better let you go
yeah it was nice talking
no no they just define it to you and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw but [laughter] yeah [laughter] anyway well good luck to you bye-bye
[noise]
um-hum
yeah w- did you move from the the Northeast
um-hum
yeah i thi- yeah it's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to [laughter] [noise]
no
well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i don't think there's probably any really
pu- that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also
and that it's mostly sales tax so it's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff i've lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and
we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we're there it was like eight hundred dollars and we're like
you know what happened is my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now [laughter] you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a
a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since we've been married we've moved a lot and so it always seems like
you know we're always paying in taxes for something and so th- it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but
i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked [noise] for accounting firm
and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the
resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places [noise] they don't have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can
you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if
i can understand maybe why the rich people don't want to pay you know a large large percent because i- you know that's not really fair either if they've earned their money
by themselves well you know people [noise] just kind of given the money it's kind of depressing sometimes i think
yeah
well yeah that's true
yeah
yeah
[noise]
yeah
but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really hasn't been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i wouldn't think
yeah
um-hum
don't you have to why people just kind of deba- expect certain services then then they don't really think they should pay for them or something maybe i don't know
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
[laughter] well it was nice talking to you i haven't ever i need to i've never initiated one of these phone calls do you call in do you get to pick the subject or do they kind of
[noise] oh i see
yeah
okay you too bye
[noise]
hi
okay you wanna start
that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans
uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something
master charge
but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing
uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house
well now i agree and uh i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion
here
uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile
um-hum
uh-huh
well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget
very simple
just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like Columbus Day President's Day
i mean they g- they get all these days off now give them
what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year
and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get
now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays
well now don't forget the mail is something else again that has nothing they're not civil servant people
no no they have their own budget they go by
no you know that's why [vocalized-noise] the price of mailing a letter keeps going up
you know i could
i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter
yeah [laughter] they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail
well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments
how do you feel about that
well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a g- a giveaway
no that that's true i- i understand that France still owes us money from World War I
and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off
and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week
uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts
to help them
uh-huh well uh i've got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas
well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world
uh that's
asking for trouble people are too different
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run
so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world there's too many societies involved uh the language barriers
uh oh sure th- somebody said years ago well let's make it English uh an international
uh language
that's a big laugh we can't even make English a a national language here in our country
we've got too many uh uh
uh immigrants
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day
a [vocalized-noise] well yes yeah but uh
my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century
and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger
he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia
and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you
[noise]
okay
hi
um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back
if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period
and
that's just
um-hum
well
[laughter]
i don't have a master charge thank you [laughter]
right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that
yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own
or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt
then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight
if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us
that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford
which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds
but i feel like the generation after us w- oh man it i would be so good
it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with wh- what they could afford to save to buy
and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer
uh-huh
[laughter]
but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans
and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it
i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it
and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans
don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just
so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know
but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy
including new vans and so
so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van
and that's where Americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled
what
[noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
i know [laughter]
yeah
i know
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah that is true
because i always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it [laughter]
you don't even know it's a holiday [laughter]
but isn't that federal in the federal budget
but isn't it part of our in- it's not part of our taxes
it's not
that's why it keeps going up huh that's another topic
[laughter]
those stamps are valuable now
[laughter]
that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that
that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because
i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to
be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order
and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money sys- we already have new bills printed for [vocalized-noise] US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them [laughter]
and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh
but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know
that's a lot of power for one or two people to have
and so um i guess because i- i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like
you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it
i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i- i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna
but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as a giveaway and it was something that
i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them
and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back
it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but
because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things
our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back but because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks
use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation
you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know
do you understand
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
[noise]
[noise]
right long wh- long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially
that's my opinion my opinion's the latter
um-hum
i know but what's yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah um
yeah different
ethnic groups [laughter]
yeah i know what you're saying
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh hi
you mentioned model railroading that uh i've been watching a program on the Public Broadcasting Station here uh about model railroading have you ever seen that
uh well it's been very interesting
uh-huh
yeah
wow
[laughter]
[noise] you should have taken the larger one huh
well uh my uh brother had a Lionel train set he was a a bit older than i and
so when i came along i was interested in uh fooling with the train and since he w- was past that stage why he didn't have any objections and
uh in fact i started doing a layout uh in our garage at one time but
i got about as far as sort of painting some uh streets and things on a piece of plywood and putting up a few things and it got to be hot summertime when i gave it up
but uh i've always enjoyed uh the train and
you know fooling with it and all
he has it
yeah i mean since it was his i couldn't very well keep it forever
but uh actually i have had an idea not long ago uh hope to build another house some day and i was thinking i might uh incorporate some sort of a display space and ask him if he would
let me put the train up you know not not as a working type of thing but just to
uh-huh
yeah i don't know what year his was bought but probably around
nineteen forty forty two maybe i'm i'm just guessing but something like that i would think
uh-huh
oh really
yeah i don't know i don't know if i don't know if he knows i know there's some uh booklets and things you know showing different models and stuff
that are quite old that were with it but i don't know if they were original or if they were picked up you know in later years
um
[laughter]
yeah that's probably the way it goes sometimes [laughter]
oh
wow
[laughter]
it has a prominent spot huh
well i think those things are neat and and as i say i watch that show and there are some uh really interesting museums around that uh have good displays and uh
i said that well if i ever took a trip i you know might ignore some of these museums because a lot of them are called childrens museums or toy museums and
that wouldn't really catch my attention but if i knew that they had you know really good train layouts i would wanna go and see what they had
um
wow
huh
it might be
well um you mentioned another hobby sailing do you have a sailboat
um
yeah
uh-huh
oh that'll be nice
oh
yeah
yeah and just be right there huh
yeah well uh we're not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um
hire a sailboat with a captain since we're not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean
right yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down i've always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um
been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i- i think i would like the sailboat
um
which do you think is best American or British Virgins
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah that's neat
ooh
[laughter]
that's getting up there [laughter]
everything
yeah that's why i think it would be neat um
sounds good
[noise]
[noise]
good morning
yes
i- i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and
i- i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it
uh
i've always had that hobby ever since i was a child
and uh
i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout
and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia
and there was uh there was two basements
there were two two separate furnace rooms
and so i took the smaller furnace room and now it's full of trains [laughter]
[laughter]
um
do you still have the uh train set
he has it
um
put it on display
well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable
yeah
well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment
and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in
nineteen forty two and forty three
so some of the pre-war models are quite valuable
well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three
and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now
[laughter] but i'm not going to give it back [laughter]
and i had a uh
post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT1 locomotives
and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs
so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now
so it's it's sitting on display on top of my bookcase
yeah
um-hum
well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays
there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway
and uh
they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long
uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel tr- and American Flyer trains
and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings
and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there
and uh it was in business for a long long time i don't know it it still maybe in business
yeah
yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife
and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay
and uh starting next weekend i'm gonna have to go down and uh
fill out for the summer season
we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer
about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia
they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isn't as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront
but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district
so that's quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them up and
show them Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh
Franklin Square
um
well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins
uh that's uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh
if you have a l- even a little bit of experience uh i've seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis
where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla
and charter a boat for a week
and they take it out and have a grand time
uh it's fairly sheltered waters right there and uh
you don't need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot
um-hum
uh i've been there several times uh the first trip uh
we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five
and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season
and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas
and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home
i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins
uh there's uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can
you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot
uh
the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh [vocalized-noise]
which is very easy to get into and there's some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving
and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner
uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive
like uh i think they're probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now
[laughter]
and uh
it's there kind of a nice place to visit uh
uh it's better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else
well i'd recommend it
[noise]
okay [laughter]
uh well we probably have about three months
approximately
um-hum um-hum we live on a it used to be a farm but we don't farm much we uh but we do have a garden
oh i wish i could be doing that [laughter]
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
you right
yeah
you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah you've had more freezing this [vocalized-noise] or this yeah winter i think
more bad weather
um-hum
[noise] um-hum um-hum are you do you work or are you retired or you
uh [laughter] uh my husbands retired but he's not a gardener he he he's been helping me more but he really isn't re- uh real crazy about gardening
but
uh-huh
uh-huh [noise] uh-huh
oh uh-huh
um-hum
huh
oh yeah
but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside and
and i like i like my garden too [laughter] we didn't have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too that which takes quite a bit of space and
we we didn't have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much
corn last year
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
hum
um-hum um-hum
oh that's great
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
we don't we don't usually cover ours we did a few different times [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise] sometimes we've covered with the plastic and other years we've tried newspapers and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring
uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it's down and then it stops
and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden
with
so
oh i do i love it
[laughter]
i'd rather be doing that than housework
[laughter]
uh
[noise]
not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with
that type of thing with the the yeah
uh
uh-huh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know it's just the it's just a lawn [laughter] if uh-huh do you eat any of them
oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad
oh it's delicious and it [noise] goes [noise] real good on dandelions um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum uh
uh-huh this is the use the greens and you get them when they're young and tender you know before they've grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy
but uh they're kind of fun to
to try get a get a few and throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes
yeah yeah
[noise]
i don't know
but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back and he's been having trouble with so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass
and we have we have hills i'm afraid of the hills [laughter] but i'm getting on to it i just pretend they're not there and i just go ahead and do it [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's great
great that's a lot of people don't have that much space even
that
uh-huh
so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also
uh-huh [laughter] well you never have enough room do you think
no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or
uh-huh
roly-poly what
is it a bug you mean
a worm a cut worm not a grub worm
oh
um
um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they would be
you find them under bricks usually and that
they're not a slug
not a
yeah yeah yeah
oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm
they're not a hard [vocalized-noise] huh
oh are they black then
but they roll up i can't think of what kind they would be
uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i i can't think of what they are
what they would be
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens
uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah
yeah [laughter] you keep trading them [laughter] yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they're they're big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they're just beginning to come out the end bud
oh
oh
oh they're such a nice bright early spring color
um-hum um-hum
um-hum and they're beautiful too yeah they're beautiful
uh-huh
oh my
yeah no we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah we're ha- it's raining today
well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn't plant anything it's just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even
and uh
uh-huh
um-hum
it's probably very pretty
uh-huh uh-huh we have some people that have done their lawns an- and uh
[noise]
so do you have do you have the long [vocalized-noise] i guess not not if there's see i was raised in New York but i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you
do you do you do you do your own gardening
[vocalized-noise]
huh see i got mine in well let's see i put in pepper plants this weekend
and uh
yeah i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen and
i enjoy tinkering with it you know it's pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes so you know we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but
yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that
but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks
as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze then i'll finish it
yeah we've had just a few you know that freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April and it's pretty tough
no i work um
i'm only forty years old i have to work
[laughter]
well
[noise]
i i really enjoy it it gives me time outdoors and you know i'm a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house an- and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and
getting ready to start for the Spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn it's a lot of work you know but it's
yeah it is
uh-huh
oh yeah
we're going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so
but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side
and then i put uh like a black plastic it's really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that
and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week
and it's pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting
oh
oh you have a spring how nice
uh-huh
oh [vocalized-noise]
uh that's pretty nice [noise]
but you actually enjoy it huh
get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around
i un- i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or [noise]
[noise]
with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and i haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet
yeah i try to
no i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i can't manage
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
well mine's full of dandelions now so
no i never have i don't know how to prepare them
no huh-uh
really
huh i've never eaten dandelions now i've tried dandelion wine
but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat
yeah
all right
yeah
i'll try that i sure will
oh
oh oh
yeah oh
so you all are into
so you all are into the lawn big time huh
yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre
and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends
no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work
yeah it's pretty nice
i have the room outside i need and i don't really have all the room in the house i need but
no
yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the are they called uh roly-poly bugs that's what my son calls them anyway
roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball
i don't know what they're called
they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no
you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist
and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball
i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see
i i don't know
yeah under bricks or under
wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up [vocalized-noise] been laying around no
a slug is actually kind of slimy an- and these are just he plays with them all the time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio [laughter]
no
no they're not real hard
they're like a water bug of sorts i don't know what they called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up
but i'm plagued with those
you know i think it's be- probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know
yeah i got fire ants too
and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then
your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we're not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh
yeah
yeah
yeah see mine are up and bloomed already
and they sure are pretty i like them and the Snap Dragons are starting to come up
yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh
tiger lilies
and they bloom in you know late June mid July and they're yeah they are they're real nice but they're they're nice and green now you know they're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches
they come up real pretty every year no problem
is it still pretty cool up there yeah
well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or
okay
yeah see we i have Bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but
Bermuda seems to be yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good down here
in Carolina and i've had Baltimore Maryland so [noise]
[noise]
i'm a non Texas Instruments employee and i alw- i always feel like when i get someone in Texas that you're probably employed by [vocalized-noise]
yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not
oh i see
uh do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished
um-hum
no i don't
oh i see
uh
in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine
well gosh i couldn't direct children i doubt that i can direct a machine are you in Dallas then
north of Dallas
yeah we uh just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the Dallas Fort Worth area without uh stopping for any reason whatsoever and i
we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around Dallas Fort Worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system
right [laughter]
[laughter] there is that time of day isn't there [laughter] uh
shall we get on to nursing homes
okay
[noise]
uh my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years
so uh i feel like i have uh
my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in
in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so
and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because
well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home
sh- yes yes she wasn't at the time
but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about
well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and uh
fo- to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different
hum
hum
um-hum
um
i'm fifty seven
[laughter]
right
um
um
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um
in our locality we have a lot of uh government services like the Home Health Care and etcetera etcetera which i'm sure they do in cities too
but we do not have the staff to draw fr- from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with th- we just don't have those people
they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice
um-hum
um
yeah
um-hum
hum
hum
hum
how long
how long were you able to maintain that
oh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh
um-hum
um-hum your mother was not living or
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
um
um-hum
um-hum
i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and uh and i don't know i suppose that would have been my excuse uh
but i don't think had that situation ex- not existed that i could have done that at all i'm not
i
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
well i think my sister is an RN and lives in Knoxville Tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to Jean's and it did take when she first went into the c- care center
she just completely gave up uh just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in
and that went on for almost six months and uh finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center
and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her
and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but
still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and um
i don't know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i've started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so
uh even though everyone knows that's the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept
no no and certainly it's very expensive there's no question about that
but we had a severe ice
wow that's great you're just getting all over the country aren't you [laughter]
oh really
yes i am i am [laughter]
well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was TI employees in the survey i- i didn't i was the other way around i th- i didn't realize there were outside people in the survey so
um i am not positive um i- i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even near that division i'm in even even in a completely different site so
i know that that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call ce- certain people back for like the second phase or something i'm but i'm not really sure i mean i know d- you know why they're y- gathering the information right
oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system
that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do
you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that
right that's exactly right
direct a machine huh
um i'm in Lewisville which is just north of Dallas just about thirty minutes north of Dallas yeah so
did you
[laughter]
sure
yeah
yeah we really do we really do unless you're doing it
first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening you know but it's that way anywhere [laughter]
there is there is it's that way anywhere you go
yeah that's fine go ahead
oh my goodness
oh really
uh-huh uh-huh
oh wow how wonderful
uh-huh
you sound like you've gotten very lucky you really have
yeah
good
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a um dia- he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and uh had diabetes for all you know many many years and
you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and
by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't
couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were
you know in the situation of a a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at fif- i'm know it it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was
it was just a horrible situation for us to bo- you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself
and uh we ended up opting for um a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine
a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it
and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because he was
so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just
too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just
it was just very hard but i guess you know there's there's there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and
you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you you end up with serious problems
you know
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
well you know
that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman
who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in [vocalized-noise] to- you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal from him we knew that she would take good care of him and
and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night
but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him
so we just got ex- we were like you only the other end we got extremely lucky all the way around that we were able to find somebody [noise] that would stay with him at home
well uh we only ma- we only did that for um i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which
we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and uh rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home
you know definitely so
uh they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and
and uh my uh youngest sister was um about an hour and a half away in college and uh i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in Atlanta Georgia you know so we weren't really
well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it's not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know y-
it's hard to move them in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just
yeah
uh-huh
that's a that's a real trying experience to try to you know to move back in and and live harmoniously together after all those years it's
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
wonderful
oh that's wonderful
um-hum
uh-huh
doesn't make it easy no
oh
no doubt no doubt
hi
or doing or doing public service
well
in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree
and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves
well yeah i think that's a good idea although i don't i think if it's something that's forced on you
um i think that the attitude
is not going to be quite the same
yeah
yeah from what i've read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives
but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it
um i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from
you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them away and make them go do something they don't want to do
sort of like the draft [laughter]
then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know
place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know
yeah
that's true that's true
i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to to make people aware
yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the pop- that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah and i think that that's the trend now i think that's the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time
and help out
yeah and get and get more out of it
so i think we or [laughter] sounds like we pretty much agree [laughter]
no i don't think i would either
do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you're doing to help i think that's more important than
[vocalized-noise]
nice talking
yeah really
well it does kind of catch you by surprise
[laughter] okay well thanks
bye-bye
[noise]
hi Chris this is Carol
this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i
suppose the idea is to um
i don't know [laughter]
but but the point be to that get
it sure does
yeah i- i- i suppose the i- the idea would be to get um people interested in public service
and to um i don't know maybe people give give p- give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have
um
well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the
things that our country is based on is freedom of choice
um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or
the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know
maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i- i'm pretty much against that
just on their own um-hum
[noise]
that's right
[noise]
i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i- i really don't think it would be feasible on our country
that's right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents
brothers and sisters things like that
i suppose they may have exceptions but um
i guess it all it would all boil down to
i mainly i- i guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's what's trying to be accomplished by
by that proposal
um-hum
more esoteric [laughter]
you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i- i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but
um
i- i think they're being taught a lot
maybe to be more responsible
and um
hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate
as as perhaps they are
pardon me
you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um
that's right
yeah it's an interesting idea but i think we do agree and [laughter]
at least i'm i'm i don't think i would vote for it if it came down to that [laughter]
maybe just do our best to
to do our own fair share and [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
that's right
well it's been nice talking to you about it i have to admit it's something i hadn't thought of before it it is interesting to think about it [laughter]
yes
[laughter]
okay we'll talk to you later bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay Bob um our project's painting um
do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea
[noise]
oh that's yeah that's for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use
yeah
then you don't have you don't have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy i'll tell you oh
um we uh
i designed and built my own home about twelve years ago
and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox
so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder
so we put uh
white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally
and the trim instead of painting i stained
so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder
the stain kind of just uh it weathers
so i eliminated that
chore that i don't have to do that i stained
the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit
but other than that
um i'm like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we've uh we've done some uh walls
the ones we haven't papered we've done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels
and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them and you don't have to worry about that
[noise]
yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension
so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn't paint the ceilings was just natural plaster
so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh
so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it
yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and
how do you control the amount of flow or anything
well is there a little electric pump you put in there
hum that's interesting
yeah
you really have a problem down there with with
having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or
oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right
so you're in the same position that i'm in i've i've only done mine twice and you've you've done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once
no no
oh like This Old House
hum
so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster
hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls
and then some of them you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up
and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i- i just don't like papering i painting is is a lot easier
all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either
uh-huh
yeah
oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on oil fired hot water baseboard
so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air
so and we don't use gas in fact there wasn't any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around
um so we didn't have that problem um
i've got a wood stove
and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't it's wood it's uh
air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh
more and more people are getting away from paint they're they're doing other things um especially with the oil base
yep yep
and there's there's less maintenance
yeah you don't have to
[laughter]
yeah that's right
[laughter]
oh i hate hanging paper that is oh that's one of the jobs that i just i'd do anything else but i'll i'll um
but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and
i did the papering
you know when we built but
that's not my uh that's not my cup of tea
yeah
so what are the other questions that i'm actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasn't up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um
we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had s- i had to do a lot of scraping
and then i put uh
uh water base paint over
the uh oil
and it was eight years before i had to do it again
and uh and the manufacturer
recommended that uh he gave me uh i can't remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it
and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds
and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago
and i don't think they've repainted since
so that's held up
and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh
water base and then before we sold it there was another one and i'd wash the house down and all that
and it's it's held up
okay
w- well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh
i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and
you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it
it's um yeah yeah it
well i- i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and
you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so
yeah right right
you know um
um
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
right yeah
the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and roller or
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah that's uh i- i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh
what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh
yeah yeah
but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller
that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller
and and it works pretty good
well it's got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it's got a trigger on it
that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle
yeah it's an electr- just a little electric pump motor that uh
turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of
pushes the paint up this uh up the extension
it's a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh
there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but
but uh the right time of year it works pretty good
well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don't really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint
for the direct sunlight and stuff
right but uh
but i- i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and r- really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it
and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again
in a couple of years
right
right so and uh yeah
on the on the interior do you do uh do y'all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don't paint a lot
oh
yeah i- i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it's you know you fix it
you fix it so
yeah This Old House and some of those and i- i really haven't you know haven't paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so
so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that
well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure
but uh
yeah
uh-huh
right yeah
yeah that's
yeah
yeah well we really have uh our our bedrooms i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh
we've got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we've got paneling in our family room and game room
so
but we don't have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted
but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't
in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your your heat adjusted your gas adjusted right
then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know cei- cei-
um-hum
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah so
um-hum
yeah
if it's been a dry
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the
and that kind of stuff are alike
the
um-hum yeah it's and it's been nice to not have to worry about painting the these rooms that we've got to have the paneling on them
of course if you decide you want to change the paper and you know you've got just about as much problem as
so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and it's that was not any fun
but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up
next time i think i'll do it the other way around let them strip and i'll hang the paper
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah that's
yeah
yeah it's there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything
covered up just right and all that so it's
oh yeah
they are
um-hum
oh that's
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
well now that's
and that's an oil base on the bottom and then a water base
over that
um-hum
yeah
okay um what do you do this weekend
hum which is wh- d- what do you plan have planned for your yard
um-hum
hum what part of the state do you live in
oh okay
okay my wife and i we live in Dallas too
um
yeah just what that area we're planning on moving to Flower Mound and we're going to be getting some
wheel [laughter] we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there
seems like it uh the place we've been living at it's uh we're we're just leasing in
the in Plano and the soil has so much has such a high clay content
that uh uh i went to use my dad-in-law's tiller and it about tore my arms off [laughter] the sockets
[laughter]
i mean just just scratching two or three inches was just a chore
it was it was
and then when it gets wet [vocalized-noise] you know you don't even want to get out in the yard
it's horrible
it's a nightmare but um
i don't know what [noise] what i- um where you live is there a real high uh alkaline or ass content or
yeah yeah
i know right where that's at
um-hum
really
golly
is it is it limestone under underneath or
how do you put trees in there
hum
oh
yeah
um-hum
oh yeah
oh yeah we trie- we tried planting tomatoes last year and it they they turned out pretty poor
i just i wi- i just wish i'd known the [noise] the variety and everything but but
it it's amazing we also have roses and i mean they just grow so beautifully
um what um what type roses
oh hybrid teas
yeah we we have a few uh of the real short stem they're kin- they're kind of like the bush roses but uh
i don't know i think it's i think it only has about five or six more years to go because it's a it's a really old bush and
but i- i i'm i'm amazed because the sun is so intense and the roses just seem to survive just fine there
um-hum
and uh
yeah have you have you uh done a done a lot of tree surgeon work on your trees or not
yeah
yeah just if you want a lot of you know light for underneath
that may be the all right because we had because we have some we have some old fruit trees we have a plum that's just about ready to go so we may just be
getting rid of that but but our peaches they they seem to be doing just fine but they they really need pruning it it just seems like they that
that even you know pruning once a year is really not enough but the the way they behave
i don't know
but uh
but uh what kind of uh what kind of what kind of grass are you growing
bermuda
yeah
oh i've i've been trying uh uh a mixture of uh the bermuda and the rye
and but i may be working like a fescue in because of you know the type of weather
it seems that uh bermuda's bermuda's fine but um it looks like it would hold the soil but it really doesn't
a lot of a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well
but uh but the rye does really well especially during the wintertime
but uh but boy once it gets over seventy seventy five degrees that it just dries up shrivels up and dies
but
yeah
my my parents-in-law they're they're building a house into the side of a hill um well it's already been built and everything
they've been living there for about three months now but uh this is out in west Texas but the the wind there has been so bad that
i- i mean they've tried to plant grass and they just have some problems big time problems they just they just washing uh
watching their lawn just blow away oh yeah
but it's
but it's quite an undertaking they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property
on a on the side of a hill it's beautiful i mean you can see the house from
you know miles away but it's you know
it's a pretty neat little job but they save a lot of they save a lot of energy but
just uh you know for them i mean they they're going to have to start gardening it's going to be from the ground up
i mean the whole way
and they said well we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just getting this property developed
[laughter]
it's amazing i mean they have have the all they have are mes- uh mesquite and cottonwoods
and uh it's it's all on Lake Greenbelt that property out there and uh
i don't know that what they have they have all the water they want they can they can actually they can pump water i mean they have to get permission but they can pump water up from the shore
but uh
that's for like an additional they have to pay like some kind of fee per year
but uh
they're uh right now though i think they're just they're trying to get the trees planted and everything
but man i- i just think of all of the money that they that they're going to have to spend just getting that
but the taxes alone there Lake Greenbelt and some places they they they really they over tax
and i mean your talking what just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes
it's it's it's ridiculous
yeah no no it's not it's because even though it's far out there it's just that Lake Greenbelt you know they have to
they they try to do it just from the selling the water but um
the water usage you know they try to limit even though there's three or four streams that flow into it
people still use it enough in like in towns like Clarendon and other areas that where they irrigate
they huh they they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming but the irr- irrigation because it's gotten so bad the past few years
but
i don't know i just came back from there and just the air is so dry i don't see how anything can survive out there
[laughter] for long periods of time should say my father-in-law says the mesquite trees is are
they're they're they're pretty smart they're smart they're about the smartest tree around they don't they don't even start growing until May may or April
like after it's been raining for a few months they say the roots have developed so that's all they work on just a leafy they don't do anything
um-hum
i- i know my my wife and i we planted on the
on the south side of our of our house we planted some gardenias and they did real fine during the summertime it's just
but during the fall when it stopped when uh the rain let off just a little bit it i mean it just dried up
and uh so i guess it these plants they just they don't it's like they remain
well uh pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard
well uh we just bought our house uh last July and it's it it the house is forty years old so there's there's an established lawn and what not flower beds things like that but they've uh they've gone a few years of neglect
so we're in the process of uh revitalizing the whole situation we've got
um [noise] different flower beds in front and uh a window box a built in window box um
trying to get some color back in those get the trees trimmed up uh get rid of a few weed problems and things like that
so
uh i live in Dallas
okay
yeah
um-hum
i'll bet
i'll bet
[laughter]
right
right
yeah it's pretty high alk- w- ac- actually it's done uh it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in uh Kessler Park area
and uh we've got about
yeah we've we've got mayb- maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil and then it's solid rock from then on down so [laughter]
yeah it's uh a little aggravating we can't we can't put in anything too big
um as far as uh shrubs and things like that because they've got to get a chance to find the find the cracks in the rock
but uh
yeah it is it's it's solid limestone
uh you just we're just happy that there's trees already there so far um anything like that is is
a uh major undertaking i guess uh sprinkler systems or anything uh start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock
but uh and it you know no- not even
consider considering a pool or anything like that that's that's practically has to be blasted in i guess
but uh and it makes it makes for a a different challenge i've never well i- i moved to Dallas about five years ago and uh
i never really messed with anything uh gardening or anything like that until now but uh i- i keep hearing all the stories of of different parts of town
in fact uh we even we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that
and the first thing the the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town we lived in
because he said uh i've got i've got a dozen different varieties and
each one works in one part of town and that's it [laughter]
that's basically what he was trying to tell us
yeah
yeah it
yeah that would in fact we put in some uh some more roses yesterday
uh different uh a few different uh hybrid tea type varieties yeah
okay
yeah
yeah that's we that's what we're searching uh we've got we've got all the different lake editions around the house and we're we're kind of experimenting right now we do we've got the direct sun in front and the backyard has two
great big uh spruce and and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall so the backyard is just complete dark all day long
and uh we're we're struggling to find something for those areas
no they're they're in pretty good condition
uh we've been we've been pretty lucky on that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
that's true that's true
it's uh bermuda
yeah
okay
right
yeah
okay
um-hum
yeah it's uh [laughter] there's such a there's such a difference through the year uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] that's it
yeah
[laughter]
oh wow
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
okay
um-hum
okay
oh okay
sure
uh-huh
wow
that really is it it would it seem like it be just the opposite when you get
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
yeah that's true
that's true
um-hum yeah that's something i've been uh
been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are at this time of the year
and you know we're trying to decide what what to what to put on one side of the house and things like that but there's so many things that they they last for just a couple of weeks and then it then it's just a a bush there from then on
it's kind of it's kind of disappointing
um-hum
yep
[noise]
okay camping my camping experiences are
uh using a trailer a Terry eighteen foot uh mobile trailer and and that's you know like going to lakes and stuff like that
setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever uh what's what's your thoughts on camping
uh-huh
um-hum
[noise]
yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh
uh uh yeah that well [laughter]
um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i'm up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that
of course camping again is i- is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i'm not
i'm not sure that the other c- type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or
that's right that's right we have we have uh around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have uh campsites that are uh barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity
and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and
uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever
oh really
[noise]
yeah they wh- Lake Texoma they've got a big uh [vocalized-noise] big rec centers up there right
[noise]
is that a pretty nice place
yeah
i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh
that's unreal yeah [laughter]
oh yeah that folds out from it it's like a crank up top thing you yeah it's you're talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay
yeah yeah you can that's about the price of them up here they're they're uh uh Sears sells them Coleman sells them
they have some some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i they're they're have a little galley a little uh sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that's like a propane stove
couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping [vocalized-noise] on either end of the the canvas when you open it up it's just all screened in so it's pretty neat uh
the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very very convenient to travel on the highway with because it's very low
mine is like pulling a big house behind you you know
[noise] yeah an eighteen foot Terry uh it's completely self-contained i mean i have everything a shower a TV everything in it you know but
yeah T E R R Y Terry
well they're i guess
they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but
i've got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i
uh if i get rid of that i'll have to get rid of the trailer because i don't i'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here
kind of hilly country up through this way but
um
well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they're all grown now and gone i've got four boys and they've kind of all gone and
we don't really do that together much anymore as they've out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but
i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and
uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more
the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that
i would lease a s- a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me
oh yeah yeah
yeah
no i drive from the campground
which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but it's not all that much uh
twenty mi- is goi- is just going a little different way it's probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but
it's uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so
and that's that's pretty nice because you can fish and just
yeah well [laughter] like i say it just uh
i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then
i'll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do
i don't want to let the i don't want to let the canopy down i don't want to jack it up i don't want to do all that stuff anymore [vocalized-noise] and just turn the key off and get in the back and do whatever you know
but uh it's been nice uh like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought i'd uh give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good
ye-
uh i thank you very much you're ever up this way look me up here at TI in Attleboro
thanks sir
[noise]
i see
sure
uh-huh
well for me camping i've never owned a trailer so for me camping is m- m- m- has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents
but i guess that this c- two kinds of camping that um i've done one is to throw a a tent and f- food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsise and setup the tent and have the the car right next to me
the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back i've done camping out in at in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where
right right
exactly
i understand
oh yeah oh
right
well either way it's get i guess maybe we can define it as living away from the home [laughter]
but
exactly
um-hum
yeah when when i mentioned i've done this camping out of the car i've actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's through Texas Instruments
yeah TI has a li- uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma it's called Lake Texoma
yeah that's right so that's where i've done most of that actually
it is it's really beautiful the the lake is is outstanding it's a huge huge huge lake
oh yeah
oh yeah i think y-
well if you every get to Dallas you can probably you know bo- you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks
yeah so it's easy to do i'm actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop-up
so it's about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you're going it raises up and there's tenting material
yes exactly
ex- exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and i've actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which
sure
yeah
uh
um-hum
oh yeah yeah that
i see
oh yeah you said yours is eighteen feet long wha-
oh yeah y- y- the brand is Terry
oh i never heard of it
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
well that's neat
[laughter]
oh yeah that's something
yeah
yeah well that's great
right
oh yeah
yeah
that's right [laughter]
a- a-
right
um-hum
and and you c- and you still do that
and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off
oh wow that's nice
yeah
i see
right
well i envy that what a great life [laughter]
yeah
huh
i understand and
[noise]
[laughter] that's right [laughter]
just want to get in and
yeah yeah that's funny well
nice talking to you too
well i appreciate it an-
and good luck with your uh your fu- your hopes of buy a Winnebago [laughter]
i'll do it nice talking to you Ray bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
what kind of coins do you primarily collect
hum
hum i've got a uh
i've got a few i don't know i don't know i don't even know if they're real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid
never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box
i'm mostly into uh
[noise]
American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that
um-hum
i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well i'll take them with me and let somebody look at them
they just they just feel phony you know they feel like they're made of lead or something
and uh they don't have any sort of i- it's got a it's got a like a picture on it
but there's no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else
[noise]
yeah
had something on them
yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh
no sort of identifying marks or anything
no i don't no they're not they're it's it's too heavy for silver it's it's more like lead i think fairly soft
yeah i think they're fakes [laughter]
[laughter]
probably [laughter] i don't know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things
it's probably about thirty or forty of them in there
yeah they
wouldn't that be something
um-hum
hum
huh
gosh all these years i've been thinking they were fakes maybe they're real [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum [laughter]
[laughter]
sounds like some of the coin dealers i know
[laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you know
yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night [laughter]
here's a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah that they they are gold they're just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value
and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon
yeah
yeah still is
yeah that's sort of like a cottage indus- industry over there
uh and and there's some very specific things you can find you can even n- narrow it down to where it was made
i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one
and uh you you can almost tell the area
somebody probably even knows the guy who made them
yeah well the [noise] yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things
and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit [laughter] and that's always very difficult
well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if it's an unscrupulous dealer he'll just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know it's yours
course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't
fraud is very difficult to prove
because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it
and that's all he's got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin
so you know it's his word against mine
[laughter]
that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on
um-hum
[laughter] yes
yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh
grading systems have changed over the last few years that's primarily what got me out of it
they they kept changing the grading systems on coins
and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection
and you've graded it at the current grade and then the next year they've changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them
you know it's just it it just go- it just got ludicrous after a while
uh
w- w- what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years
and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly they're M S sixty five i don't care what you say
and they'll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them
at inflated prices
[noise]
oh yeah yeah i mean it's r- it's it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um
Indian head pennies you know
and they say wow you know this is really old
yeah well it's not worth anything [laughter]
[laughter] i'll give you a nickel for it you know
[laughter]
and e- even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces
and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars
oh yeah yeah they're cheap they're super cheap
um
several i mean i- i- it it's funny the way the business works because there're so many things that are enormously out priced
um
some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars
you know and and the coins themselves aren't worth very much at all face value basically
uh
and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else
uh
you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and it's traded for silver
yeah
no it's it's more of a uh it's a commodity purchase really
uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some
some uh
nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books
can fill a whole bunch of them
with these uh with these bags
uh especially y- you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves
uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things
i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um
i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced
um but i used to go th- i i'd get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh a- about twelve bags of these things
and i'd gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB
and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce
i found several good ones out of there
people's giving it to me for two cents i uh that's okay
turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars [laughter]
[noise]
um basically i my preference is Arab
coins
and ancient coins
um-hum
oh very interesting
um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so i've got a few of those tucked away but
um your Greek and Roman coins m- you know if if they're um
in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and
um-hum
that would be the Greek ones
okay because i think most the Roman ones have
right right so this
um-hum
um it the are they silver or
bronze
oh interesting
[laughter]
did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily
oh
um-hum
gee that's
[laughter] you might be sitting on a gold mine
right um i don't know a lot about um Greek and Roman although i'm a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club
and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so i've picked up a bit
but um if it if they're really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins
and um
[laughter]
right i don't uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes
you know if you go to um uh a fight and then
the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night
but um
i think that's fairly recent phenomena probably
[laughter]
now now [laughter] they're supposed to they're supposed to be licensed and the um above board
oh i see [laughter]
oh and you made your own
[laughter]
[laughter]
was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold
right
oh really
is that uh s- still true
wow
um-hum
you mean ma-
oh
i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody can't say
you know when he's selling them that somebody else made it i mean it's
so that he gets his own profits
[laughter]
hum
oh i see otherwise the the buyer is
respon- i mean re-
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
right
um-hum
right right
oh that's interesting because i'm more interested in the research and i'm doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the
six and seven hundreds and s- and so i'm not into the the buying and selling business
um it sounds like i'm wise [laughter]
[laughter]
oh
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
right
um-hum i think that's that's the the hardest thing is that
people who don't really know feel sometimes a s- for example i know um you know the ancients better but
because it's old they figure it's got to cost you know thousands of dollar-
um-hum
oh
[laughter]
right right
oh really i didn't know that
oh that
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
so basically if if someone isn't really interested in the coins it's not some an investment
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh
um-hum
right
[noise] um hello um what is your favorite um food for a dinner party
[noise] do you do Tex-Mex
oh fajitas how do you make fajitas
um-hum
oh
oh
um-hum
um-hum
oh it sounds good
okay
well that's nice
oh well basically um because i lived in the Middle East for a while i tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when i have have people over [noise]
and so um some of the dips are like um chick peas mashed with um sesame
and um called foo- um what's it called i forgot what it's called [laughter] anyway and and lem-
that's right that's right it's called humus now i remember it and um uh dipping Arabic bread the thin pita bread in that
or another dip is made with very similar but with um eggplant which has been
actually barbe- it ends up with a barbecued taste [noise] although we usually bake it in the oven or if we have uh those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it
black on the outside but mushy on the inside
[laughter]
[laughter]
but barbecue is it like steaks or is it uh turkey
would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken or
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum i'm sure that uh the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce i wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would
uh-huh
um-hum
[noise] right right
well it's been fun talking to you
[laughter]
right
uh in Wyoming it would be less spicy
[laughter] vegetables once in a while
[laughter] oh dear
okay very good
okay bye-bye
[noise]
um [noise] i don't know i- i think i make things you know that i do things kind of simple because i- i you know i just have close friends over i make like lasagna and uh
oh we like to have barbecues outside so you know when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather so we do a lot of um things like that um
i'm not really into gourmet cooking so i don't know how to do that so i don't have gourmet foods [laughter]
um yeah you know like fajitas an- and stuff like that so
um it's kind of like made out of skirt steak and you marinate it
you can buy marinating mixes here i don't know if [noise] get it up there or you can you know marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like and then you um
[noise] you quick fry it real fast wi- in hot
hot grease you know not a who- not not deep frying it but you can either barbecue it which is really good
with uh green beans not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions
[noise] and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um
thin you know bite size pieces
then you put it on flour tortillas with you know guacamole and um
[noise] sour cream and
you know all kinds of you know k- it's like a Tex-Mex type thing
it's really good you can do it with chicken too chicken fajitas and stuff
[noise] so
so what kind of cooking do you do up there
oh that sounds interesting
uh-huh
[laughter]
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names yeah yeah
oh
[noise]
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
oh that's unusual i'd never heard of anything like that you know here in Texas it's all you know Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue and
[noise] they're really big on stuff like that and
yeah
yeah you barbecue s- pardon me
oh yeah you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill but my i cook my turkeys inside you know it b- you can buy smoked turkeys
[noise] and or uh but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers hot dogs
you know the simple things like that and
you know we we like things like that you know barbecue beans or baked beans and
no no this is more like hickories hickory type you know depending on the barbe-
it's like a smokey flavor if you've ever you know had stuff like that yeah it's totally different sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle Eastern cooking so
yeah
yeah it's been fun it's been ni- it's uh [noise] you know neat to learn some what different people eat so
you get to think you know i come from Wyoming and it's basically the same same type of thing except for you do eat more [noise] the Tex-Mex down here so
yeah yeah you you know down there it's just like meat and potatoes you know [laughter]
yeah right [laughter]
[noise] well it's been interesting to talk to you
thank you for calling bye-bye
well what's your favorite shows
[laughter]
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh that's one of my favorite
yeah Mystery and uh Masterpiece Theater
yeah
um-hum
yeah i don't not anymore i don't there's just nothing on it
i got i got sort of hooked on that uh Dark Shadows
yeah i when i watched it originally i didn't know it was a i don't know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie
and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what
and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it
not really it it it's it's gotten to the point it's getting ridiculous now and
they they just had the uh season finale and i don't i don't know what they accomplished but i think the writers just
figure well let's just do anything and
we'll we'll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas
yeah
yeah
yeah i don't like programs that i can figure it out
um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law
i really like that
yeah that's that's my favorite
well i'm i'm a struggling law student
[laughter] and
i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there
yeah it's not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want
and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good
um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do i mean
they're they're in California and th- they're waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case
so uh
i mean you know it's very difficult to
yeah it would yeah
no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly [laughter]
yeah i'll agree with you there
i'll agree with you
i know i know the shortcomings too
uh well not it's not on my that's not on my list of [vocalized-noise]
now there was some of the some of the classes i'm in i think i'm in Sesame Street but uh
some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird
that's it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge
better than some of the judges i've seen
yeah i've got my own pet peeve about judges but uh
oh well we're stuck with them
sort of like lawyers you know
[laughter]
um let's see what else is oh i like A&E
they don't have A&E on cable in Dallas
[noise] uh-huh
oh
oh
yeah i'll tell you
[noise] the um
uh A&E and Discovery and CNN i couldn't i couldn't live without those
oh yeah i- i just leave it when i'm home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it
yeah best coverage
yeah
uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didn't have anything to say
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean
it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean
it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and
yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven o'clock
and for i don't know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news
you know and i'm going i will never get to see Jeopardy again
yeah
i'm saying what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first half hour
nothing
yeah
oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well that's good that's good
yeah oh boy golly gee [laughter]
yeah we are
[noise]
yeah well i- it was intere- it was int-
no i mean there there
there was nothing to it
i mean
i mean yeah i'm happy for that
i'm happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because i'd been in the i'd been in the military for thirteen years and i w- and i worked in intelligence
and and there was no
yes another one of those [laughter] military intelligence ha ha [laughter] that's what that's just like justice for all [laughter]
but i mean my goodness there's they're sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians
and i'm sitting there thinking to myself uh-huh sure
i mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people can't read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks
yeah
i mean
they can't even read their own language
yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli's could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam
that's right i mean the Israeli's aren't
they're not afraid of anything
see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in [vocalized-noise]
that doesn't uh that doesn't that situation doesn't sit around and develop very long
all right i- i- i think everybody's jumping to conclusions i don't think anything's going to change
no first off i don't think the the Middle Eastern situation's going to change i don't think that
they're not
yeah they're not going to come up with
they're not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap
um-hum
yeah
well they they get Oshmid Yakomo you know the janitor for the US Embassy and you know
[laughter]
yeah really and it was it was r- it was even worse here in North Carolina because because a lot of the
matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F-16 squadrons came out of North Carolina
so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know
and and
i and i understand the way they feel about their
husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh [noise] this is so terrible i just i don't know what we're gonna do well i'm thinking to myself
you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military
you know i'm going it what did you think it was
a paycheck
you know run around and and play soldier
well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who
who's unit was ordered up and he refused to go
i hope he got busted
yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth
which is good i'm glad
um-hum
and then and then she
that's right then she didn't want to do her obligation yeah
well i you know i'm not i'm not racist or anything but one of my one -nother one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military
so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites
now to me that doesn't make any damn sense
oh gosh that's hard to say [laughter] it's um used to be a big Twin Peaks fan but they've made me mad so i haven't watched them in a wh- in a while
um
oh [noise] i watch a lot of uh public we watch public television a lot Mystery and
oh [noise] oh i oh i really like Mysteries
yeah i watch that occasionally when
there's something really interesting on
but uh
oh [noise] out out outside of that i it's it's hard to have a
i don't really watch a whole lot [laughter]
yeah
have you
um
[laughter]
yeah is is it good is it
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah that that's that's kind of what happened on Twin Peaks they did all this big building up building up building up and then the [noise]
the solution was ridiculous i had it figured out by the third
i thought i already had it figured out and i did and that made me mad [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
well my parents my parents really like LA Law
[noise]
is it good i've i've always heard it was really good
oh [laughter]
do they
oh yeah
you know like they they at least you know they've been in a courtroom before [laughter]
oh of course
yeah
oh no
ooh Lord
yeah
it'd be nice if justice traveled that quickly but but it sure it it it sure doesn't
[laughter]
yeah well it's not really justice's fault but that's on a another whole subject altogether [laughter]
oh
yeah yeah yeah
oh let's see what oh i guess i've got a two year old so we do Sesame Street everyday [laughter]
[noise]
no
not it not no it's a it's not something
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
uh yeah oh yeah [laughter] have an intellectual role of Big Bird that's pretty good
[laughter]
oh that's true that's true
yeah yeah that we're kind of stuck with them
[laughter]
oh
i wi- i wish we got i wish we got that on our cable system we don't there's always good stuff on A&E
well not where i am not we're we're in far north we're i mean we're
i'm thirty five miles north of Dallas in McKinney it's a small town there's only one cable system here and i've ca- griped about them not having A E [vocalized-noise] A&E but they don't have it i mean in Dallas they do
oh yeah i wat- oh i like C i like CNN's new uh news coverage better than anybody's
yeah du- during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long
yeah oh the oh much better than anybody else's
[noise]
now they're plus they had all the inaccuracies were rid- then they'd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just
um-hum
yeah oh yeah
but uh they they interrupted for no good reason a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
re- it was just rehash re- to- oh
nothing [laughter] and i- i know i know the scud att- scud attacks are s- are exciting to somebody but after you've seen them seen them for two weeks in a row
[laughter]
across the black sky a white streak [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
[laughter]
well maybe maybe we're a bit uh uh
oh
jaded
and and [vocalized-noise] because television's brought everything into your living room
but it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't [laughter]
which is that's good that's good but
for TV coverage it's pitiful
oh
oh [laughter]
contradiction in turn [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
i know
um-hum
no they can't
it's put it in Russian
[laughter]
yeah it it
it was just it was the coverage just went way too far
oh that's that's what my husband says he says just send the Israeli's in to [vocalized-noise] to pick off Saddam they'll they'd love it i mean
huh-uh no [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah
no [vocalized-noise]
i just wonder what's going to happen to the hos- to the the hostages that's over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things
you don't think so i just
oh that's true oh oh are you kidding but they all hate each other
huh-uh
you know you you see them on interview they interview everybody and everybody says the same things
that they always have
oh yes i know
yes i keep saying when are they going to knock on my door and interview me they've talked to everybody else in the world [laughter]
was it
did they
oh yeah oh yeah
oh yeah
[laughter]
they're they're voluntary army
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah they do they think it's a paycheck
yeah
we had a doctor that did that here
oh yeah she did [laughter]
yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education
and they kept having her on the news every night
uh-huh ooh she's she's
in hot water [laughter]
oh yeah oh yeah
oh yes
[vocalized-noise]
nobody forced
[noise]
so Eric what do you think um
that
yeah
[noise]
so you think that they that those products should cost more
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
wow um-hum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i- i didn't up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of
y- you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh
and uh i- it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house
really i mean [laughter] so what choice do you have then
yeah i did it's just that uh
there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down
you know that's the problem that i think we have
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent
somehow we still
i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back
and that hasn't happened
um-hum
oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think
yeah that's true
yeah that's true
yeah
yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases
uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's
supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not
yeah
yeah
i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal
but
i can't really understand why
um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes
um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage
of someone's well -f if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted
toward the top end if i- i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money
i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit
yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent
and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic
you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent
you know
well that's
they they get we- it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized
women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live um
hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood
um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in uh
medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and
hum
yeah
yeah i think that if we could model
you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have
already working and adapt it
tha- that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today
[laughter]
hum
yeah
[noise]
[laughter]
well i'm m- more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um
i tend to view um and i- i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that
well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs
and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of
forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected
in
well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is
a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are
brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is
government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care
um but that's a very long-term sort of concern
um i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh
no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real uh real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly
um-hum
yeah well exactly
um-hum um-hum
yes well i [laughter] i don't know anyone who paid cash for a house that's for sure yeah you don't have much um i
[laughter] i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but that's not really a possibility at this point it has it's own inertia and
yeah i hope so [laughter]
yeah well i'm i'm in academics and actually i'm in the job market now trying to get a professorship and i'm watching uh the education budget getting cut
back so severely um at least in California where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh
because i'm i- i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment
there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation
in the in the course of a decade um we are [vocalized-noise] a lot has changed more radically
and
yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably [noise]
um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's
it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to
um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that [vocalized-noise] you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's th-
and it's the governments it's the governments sh- that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government
and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new
you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um
they're personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low [laughter] because it's they didn't they didn't borr- i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldn't feel very happy about it [laughter]
um
so it's a sort of like this is uh [vocalized-noise] i see a [vocalized-noise]
i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to
um-hum um-hum
um-hum um-hum
yeah i- i- i tend to get a little upset about loans to coun- to obviously corrupt governments um
there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but it's hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point [laughter]
um
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
you could afford to pay more taxes
um-hum
um-hum um-hum well boy uh i mean i completely agree with you um on
the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years um
yeah it's it-
um-hum
um-hum
well the US pays the US pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country [laughter] um
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
yeah they
they get things that they pay for
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i- i think that's um well i think that's an important thing personally um
um-hum
well they
yeah i think the the Americans that i know who are are are sort of antitax a lot of them seem antitax because they're distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely
and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it
seems to be an an an attitude i hear is a lot of people and i think you hear that att- you if you go to Sweden you won't hear that as much people will say well we need those services and we're it makes our country great so we will are more willing to pay for it uh [noise]
um-hum um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah well it uh it may not last [laughter] once they [noise] i hope it does but it's uh it's uh sad situation part of this this you you hear the phrase creeping socialism
which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um
you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping
a type of work station
is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine
it's eighty eighty eight
okay uh
what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously
okay uh i use them both here at work and at home
and i have IBM clones in both cases
here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base mach- machine
yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it
uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size
and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees because
i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it's knees
just in the ability to handle
and then i have uh
a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine
at home and i'm really pleased with it
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches
uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them
have you
to try to make them more effective and useful
have you been uh struggling along those lines
well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh
i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it
the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that
of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error
not a fun thing to try to recover from
very frustrating
uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise
uh that was a
engineering spec on B2
you come here with the B level of specs
well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build
uh
to one level down from assistant description
well i sure need them
uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them
yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things
i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have
when you start seeing what all they can do for you
well i understand that [laughter] you know
uh if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty six machine at home
[laughter]
right
uh that's came out around the first of the year
it does a few more things uh
than
had been available before
but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation
because you no longer can think that fast anyway
well okay i enjoyed our discussion
you do the same
bye
[noise]
okay
um
now the term personal computer uh i don't happen to have one at home
um
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here
yeah uh yeah just kind of it's kind of a kluge
that was pieced together to to uh
shall we say bypass the formal
procurement process
and uh it it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor
Panasonic printer
uh
no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do
no it's not even that
uh i think that's about where it is
uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM
uh
nothing extremely complex
uh-huh
yep
oh yeah i bet that's a pretty nice setup
yep
wow
yep
wow
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and
now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that
uh-huh
oh
huh
i can bel- i can believe that
no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing
oh okay
oh okay
okay
oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers
i can believe that
well it's it's been interesting
yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six
that that must be a fairly recent release
okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but
i didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet
uh-huh
yeah
sure
yeah
i did too and you have a good day
bye-bye
all right now we used to be big time campers but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports
well [noise] when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know w- we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents
and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way
so we've always enjoyed camping
uh-huh
ye- yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know
like one night and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it
oh yeah oh me either [laughter] i hate to be on any that stuff
oh yeah
oh
yes yes
oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it's not something i'd want to do real often i'm a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know
yes
well not really because usually it's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so it's usually like that
just about [laughter]
just about
oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family
it's a lot easier then
oh uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
oh i'd like to go anywhere you know i just like to go [laughter]
i really do
no not really not that much um we've been well
we've been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long
you know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on
but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston [laughter]
you know [laughter]
yes yes
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to it's July you know and it's so hot
and our camper doe- doesn't have an air conditioner
yeah it's one of those pop-ups i'm sure you could put one in probably but we hadn't did that
yes we all enjoy camping and they're you know they're in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also
at least their daddy goes with them i don't when they do that but
that really is
well how old is your boys your children
uh-huh
oh yes yeah yes
it really is mine's eleven and eight
so they really enjoy it too
[laughter] yeah
yeah yes yes
oh but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp
you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there's nothing holding them back but i'm just not that involved in it
yeah
oh
uh-huh
me i haven't really as far as entertainment i don't know what you would do if
you know but i guess
my entertainment's television i guess
uh-huh
oh i don't either [laughter]
uh-huh
yes but they probably live in a city also don't they
well see we're in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference
because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know [laughter]
that makes a difference
it was nice talking to you too and we'll probably be talking to you again okay okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh what type of camping did you do
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
oh how neat
uh-huh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable [laughter]
uh-huh
right
yeah
uh-huh
yes i don't i don't think i'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff [laughter] but i i try
[laughter] but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy
and it's all over him the poor thing you know so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at [laughter]
oh shoot
uh-huh
yeah
right right definitely when it's cool well have you done much camping around Texas
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well have you camped all over the United States
wow see now i haven't so that i bet you that's an experience there
uh-huh uh-huh
right right
well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they've been going to Gulf Shores Alabama
and uh which is really really neat they said they've got the white beaches and the sand and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there
uh-huh uh-huh
well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains
uh-huh
right right
yeah [laughter]
[noise] oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah that's that's my idea of camping
but we're uh we're getting more into it and we've done uh we've done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that's good you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping
right
uh-huh uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat
well
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah oh that's neat that's really neat
well i well i have um a son that's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that's thirteen
so they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too
and that's that's really neat
uh-huh
yeah yeah
yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so [noise]
oh well maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular
[laughter]
trees or what bushes whatever they are [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldn't do that you know
yeah yeah
just getting away
yeah right right see i see they just want to get away
but every Friday night they'll go home you know straight from work and they'll pack up and you know and then they'll leave and i'm just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so
but anyway that's their life [laughter]
yeah yeah that's true
uh-huh
now that's true that's true
yeah [laughter] that's true
well it was nice talking with you okay
okay well take care bye-bye
[noise]
where do you live
uh-huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i'm now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world
so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them
um-hum
well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um
cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the um [noise] garbage men
come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb
yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for uh aluminum and
uh steel one for metals
and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags
so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every Thursday and the garbage men come by and
uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape
and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling
yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound
they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have
two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh
one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or
things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste
um-hum
well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got
so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be
a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things
we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high
and you get them for i think it's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen
and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible
and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays
and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is
and now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds
yeah
if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would
right
no i think it's i- it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up
than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans
for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back
now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags
uh-huh
yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused
they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want the a plastic bag that's full of goop [laughter]
here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want
any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles
and [vocalized-noise] there right outside the
that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers
and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags
oh yeah
well how nice that's great
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well that's they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost
pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh
three weeks after Christmas and
uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths
so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags
and they even picked up our uh
styrofoam pl- packing materials
they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only
if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that
any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them
but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas
well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
they don't mash [laughter] they don't compress at all and they stay forever
um-hum
yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff
uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts [laughter]
yeah
now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody
so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so i- it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or
uh China cups to use up our water [laughter]
but at the moment we're using the China cups
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day
yeah
well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because
yep
it sure will well good to talk to
uh in the Houston area
oh that's great
oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get
organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves
and uh
uh-huh
i think that's great there's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out i don't know if it's
the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh
bins
oh
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh that's great
uh-huh
yeah we're we're all for it our um we've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh
you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places
yes
um-hum
oh it does it does but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know
you know there i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy
and so you know you could always apply the magazines toward that
yes
[laughter] oh i know it
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
oh uh-huh
oh that's great
right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling
like that because you know i've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it
uh
yeah oh yeah you know and i don't mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that [vocalized-noise] but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed
uh-huh
oh i oh i know it
um-hum
right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
[vocalized-noise] we have i know of one that the one that we use uh
has uh recycling for the bags
and uh
and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags
oh that's great
oh
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] yes
[laughter]
uh-huh
i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out
and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that he he
and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also
i remember at Christmas the the only thing that i'm when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they di- uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees
uh to for them to mulch
for for city use
an-
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there
uh-huh
uh-huh
right well see that's one
well the but uh something nee- does need to be done about the styrofoam
that uh
oh yeah i mean they don't uh uh
no
right and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh
they're recycling them into other plastics
and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized
along those lines
right
um-hum
right [laughter]
oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants
that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam
but uh
um
[laughter]
well that's good
that's uh
they should last a while
i believe we are i- i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening
and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it
[noise]
so what kind of benefits d- do you have in your job that you think is uh very important
health care like dental
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
right
so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health
right
i hear that's like one of the major uh the major costs to com- to corporations nowadays
um-hum
right
see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job
so i don't have [laughter] and i'm still in in school i'm still in college
and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits
but i- i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean
dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much
to for me i think it's like uh
you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but
to actually have you know big coverage for something like that
right i'm only twenty one
um-hum
right
exactly yeah
um-hum
as health
right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible
uh-huh i guess it also depends on how m- how many times you're going to use it
right
right so
uh-huh
too expensive more expensive for them to do that then
um-hum so th- that's pretty good
um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy
the very first thing i- i should look at huh
no not yet
um-hum
what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger
and that's scary because you know in the end you're getting insurance for basically nothing
i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance [laughter]
yeah
yeah
that sounds like a big big asset to do that
well it's been nice talking to you
i guess i'll uh maybe see you again sometime
you too bye
health care
number one
dental and medical yes
yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year
and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance
and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance
so i was really fortunate i really was
i think they will as long as they can but the problem
obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year
uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up
and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it
oh yeah
that's a problem too yeah
um-hum right
um-hum right
oh i
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you
for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive
and if your blessed with you know good dental
uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up
you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then
so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part
but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them
oh gosh that's that's the general you know y- you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately
i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say
uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage
now we
that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from Texas Instruments and they're just they're like most everybody el- you can't just
you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go
but there's only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount
if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go
also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions
to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective
right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it
and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself
um-hum
absolutely you need about even probably
absolutely do you have a family
i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do
but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks
um-hum right
that's right
um-hum
right
yeah absolutely absolutely
um you know some companies can- can't even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they're just dropping it you know they don't have any choice it's bankrupting them
but i'm i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits
oh absolutely absolutely
same to you [vocalized-noise]
okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye-bye
yeah
um-hum
um-hum yeah
yeah that that is uh a tough situation i mean because
you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and
and you kn- uh people go home and the jury duty is always like you know kind of whining about it all
seems like if people were were really you know into the subject and uh
i don't know i mean i guess if there if it was more people it would be better if it was just like you know the majority
but i guess the smaller number of that was like six or twelve which there usually are so
um and i guess unanimous
uh
yeah i kind of agree with that
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i can see that
[laughter] yeah
yeah
yeah i heard about um is is there true that there's a if a lawyer takes a a case to court and it's what do they call it um frivolous is that is there still a frivolous law that they can
yeah but do they get um fined the lawyer
oh
yeah i never i didn't realize until recently that there was actually a fine they could pretty interesting though
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
oh really [laughter]
[laughter]
oh
oh gosh
yeah
oh that would be really tough
[laughter]
yeah you really do
yeah i mean because seems like
i don't know i mean there's so many different different types of cases that come in i mean it seems like just general people i mean
who are live in the community and do different things you know you have different opinions kind of just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would would get it start thinking a certain way and go go nuts [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah true
yeah
that is hard to say
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh i hadn't ever thought of that really
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah it does
gosh
yeah
all right well groovy it's been cool talking to you see you around bye
[noise]
an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury
i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it'd be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but
or even if he just through years of being on the bench just becomes uh out of touch with uh the population and he only sees the bad side of life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions
however the complexity of some of these uh cases it's just they spend more time educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision
then it would take if the judge just made the decision especially when it is purely um noncriminal uh litigation type uh whatever you want to call it the term
civil uh suits as it were or even some corporate uh law
when there's not any individual involved and some of those are solved without a a jury but uh some some do choose to go before it
um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final
okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve
then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person
that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little
or going to the the
very
farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh
trying not to get a wrong decision
the uh system as it stands now i think if if the juries were done away with the judge could render a decision much quicker
uh and you'd you'd feed more people through the courts as it were don't know where we'd put them once we got them through your courts but uh
i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the norm- as it is can't upset the system very much
probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out
i would imagine that's left up to the judge i i would assume he could consider it a contempt of court and and uh but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of court
certainly makes sense because some of this stuff is you know y- you're just doing this to do this you know it's
just doesn't make sense
so that's pretty bad [noise] a friend of mine is a is a judge here in the -ell actually you know it McKinney because we're in Collin County
and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasn't much of a step up as it were
um it's really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases it's it's all up to him as oppose to a jury
and there's just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or
and of course there couples get kind of spiteful at times and
and you hear it all through the worst side of people throughout the whole time
well let me think here
um
as far as the judge making the decision
uh-huh
yeah that's true
but then look at the group that tends to accept jury duty
you you either have the person who who is uh the type of individual who can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them you know let them go
and and those are shall we say blue collar that that
your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the self-employed businessman willing to go because he though he may be
current on all you know several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some counties
so it i don't know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there
though i have had a judge fact this very judge friend of mine say that he uh does not like to have people on the jury that are from uh the electronics industry
and i said well me being from the electronics industry i'll bite why [laughter] why don't you like it and he said well
he said the majority of them uh tend to dive into their little world of of electronics and be very technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is
and they usually don't um read outside their field they don't read social type uh papers they don't they're not up to date on various uh current affairs as it were and
and i said well that that's quite possible i said i've discussed some topics with people even over this situation and and discovered some views that i hadn't thought of in a while i just wondered if i got out of my little realm
uh if i wouldn't run into people with some more diverse views
but uh my realm is pretty well technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems
i guess it's too frustrating [laughter]
[noise]
so
well i think we've managed to kill a little time on the topic and we'll go ahead and
we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe
okay bye
[noise]
well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat
sure
right
it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because
uh it used to be s- so [vocalized-noise] much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it
and now that with Gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though
you know everybody's following the same pattern and uh th- the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was
the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable
um-hum
y- exactly
right
[laughter]
right well it it's amazing just because of the drain it's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better
but uh the Russian economy they you know they i don't know what the percentage is but i heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine
and finally you know who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this
uh the US isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors
but it's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is
um-hum
right
expend
uh-huh
well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy tha- that was here in you know twenty years ago
uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have [vocalized-noise] have not been world powers
so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've
who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them
uh-huh
exactly
yeah uh that [vocalized-noise]
personally i don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change
but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either
um-hum
uh-huh
right
um-hum
yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken [vocalized-noise] the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if i'm
a Soviet an- if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succ- you know succeed
am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with
uh and that they may have been forced i'm not that familiar with their future but i you know i it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join but
um-hum
um-hum
and then just never given back [laughter]
yeah
well that whole uh the whole i- idea if you look at the Russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer
and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that
[vocalized-noise] that buffer isn't going to help you you can li- i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the
the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai an- and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there
yeah there's there's very little that that buys you anymore in today's technology
[laughter] that's probably very true ve- that's very interesting never thought of that
um-hum
nobody knows to do
is it real
uh-huh
right [vocalized-noise] exactly
i get confused between all the which is the Soviet provinces versus what are the the Russian provinces versus what are
um-hum
right
oh as a as a vote
sure sure
[laughter]
[laughter]
died down on that i thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militory military force but it's merely an economic now
well y- i mean at yeah exactly
um-hum
exactly an- and all the
well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe [noise] what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there
what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have uh a million plus people in the indu- you know in each country from the US
i don't know that it's so much a military
threat anymore as a
[laughter]
well you know i- it- it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess it it takes awhile to to get used to something
you know if if they have completely chan- [vocalized-noise] the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be uh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i thi- you know th- the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebody's about to
to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh
[noise] um you know i'd i'd like to think that that isn't true but uh i- i you know the evidence is that
uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east German situation it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if i'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i'd say no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i- i think you know what i'd have to i- i gue- i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a a little bit
you know leery of the whole thing what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead an-
sort of disarm and you know i even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might've been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some
some military hardware of course it didn't turn out that way and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know
um-hum
yeah
i don't know
yeah or or we can do something about it yeah
um-hum
yeah
well th- the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the
in uh Red Square or wherever said okay and that's enough and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that and
um-hum
yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just s- some pretty hard by the socialism and uh
you know th- the reaction
[noise] you know th- the economic well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams
you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that
the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no
as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody vo- you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice
yeah
um-hum
yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together
you know by force there's there's no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at th- later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties
and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans [noise] and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so that's a a little different situation
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers
i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be [laughter] yeah
yeah yeah well uh i- i guess
what they'd have to do to uh
[vocalized-noise] i really don't know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other
you know i- is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know what's uh what's what's really happening here
but you wonder how well this thing Bo- who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is i guess the
uh the biggest
um-hum
well in the center but you got uh the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as Russia
and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet autonomists
[vocalized-noise] you know they had some real fancy names for them a matter of fact when the uh [noise]
yeah what i read when the uh the uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh
of these
you know republics as a separate country you know so there'd be there'd be nineteen rather than one
and uh the United States said well that'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that
yeah well i wonder if that [laughter] wh- uh wh- whether get shot by something that's called uh an economic force or whether it's called a military pact you know it's all you can change the name of something but i wonder if it's still
exists although i've seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers [vocalized-noise]
well [vocalized-noise] the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's they're having a housing shortages now what do you do with all these
troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their
yeah well that's not
yeah
yeah the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh
uh [laughter] i guess
okay [laughter] with two little kids i can understand that [vocalized-noise]
oh [laughter]
what uh what kind of
hum
oh
um-hum
by uh somebody who was there or
um-hum
yeah well any of the guys that were ground [vocalized-noise] yes yeah i can imagine
yeah well i tell you what i'm a kind of uh a history
nut i'm trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh
periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book and uh the last uh [noise] i'm embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot
right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the Michener uh Lone Star or the the Texas History Book
oh well i've had similar problems it does tend to to
yeah as a matter of fact yeah [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh there was a lot more to it than that weren't there
yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern
support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in
areas uh in rebellion against the United States all the other areas which would i think at that time would have included West Virginia and
oh may have been Kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the South but still had slaves they didn't emancipate them
um-hum
i've got the same problem
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
isn't isn't much there is there [vocalized-noise]
they supplied some uh you know they were some groups
uh the Vicksburg if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg the battleground at Vicksburg
uh there's an area there where there was uh some Texas uh
groups and they had an interesting time there
and down there at Sabine Pass uh i can't think of the guy's name but he held off the
you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union
navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story
[laughter] that could be it [laughter] could be it [laughter]
[laughter]
and then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde you know over there on the Texas border you had a lot of
of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less at Eagle Pass
and they didn't get across the river there so they're the last and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last
organized battle between the two units was in Texas so
yeah Texas participation in the Civil War was uh minor at uh [laughter]
at best yeah
yeah well my wife's from Galveston so
yeah Well i'm from New Mexico so you know i was [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
it sounds like Iowa or something
um-hum
hum
yeah on yeah
oh well my sister's living in Illinois right now so [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
i've always kind of enjoyed it i- i used to read a lot more than i do now
um-hum
yeah
um
i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here and i see Armageddon up there
and uh the Shadow of Blooming Grove
and Two Thousand and Ten and Grant Takes Command and The War in the Year oh Space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was Space James Michener
didn't get very far on that
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it really the the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least
no let's see here's one called Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of New Mexico now not too many people have read that one i don't think
and there's The History of Yoakum County Texas there
i've got uh
yeah and i've got yeah and i've got a History of Kingsley Iowa
well because that's where my folks all came from [laughter] and they had a centennial here awhile back
i read the Grant Takes Command that was pretty good
that was part of that trilogy that uh Bruce Canton did
yeah
sometimes it's awful hard some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know the
oh
yeah
uh-huh you're reading Dune
that was a movie too wasn't it
was it
yeah i'd i didn't see it but uh
yeah
Patrick Stewart was in that i guess the guy that's on the new Star Trek series was in that thing uh [laughter]
oh really [laughter]
uh
um-hum
couldn't [laughter]
yeah
um w- well some history books are pretty scary but yeah [laughter]
no somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen they didn't sleep all night
yeah
yeah i have no i- i don't have the foggiest notion what it is about so
okay yeah [laughter] but
um-hum that's the one
even better than Jaws and some of that
[laughter]
yeah
oh [vocalized-noise]
a a Freddy Kruger type huh
[laughter]
oh the worst kind yeah yeah
oh i just read for escape [laughter] well i mean it's
yes it's that's simple i read to escape and i don't read any Parents magazines either [laughter] so
well i just finished just i just finished one last night a great book
it it's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien
and it's uh God i don't know if i would call it
a collection of Vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories
strange book beautifully written
just beautifully written
yeah a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier so he considered himself to be you know a a true Vietnam soldier
yeah so what's the latest one you've read
uh-huh
i have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work
have you are you a Civil War buff at all
because i finished one
i think this is like two years ago
and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the Civil War John Jakes one and the novel didn't do that much for me but boy the period of time was fascinating
so i then read
was it Battle Cry of Freedom
yeah i think it was Battle Cry of Freedom it's kind of like a historical compendium
of the Civil War and it's not a story of the Civil War it's a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led
to of the events that brought about the Civil War and it's fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know Emancimation Proclamation with the Civil War
[vocalized-noise] there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought
oh yeah
um-hum
well you know what else really surprised me now i'm married to a native Texan and i'm not
uh
[laughter] yeah i'm glad you put it that way and i have two native Texan children too my husband is always you know talked about [vocalized-noise] Texas being a uh rebel state and oh my God all this Civil War pride
i kept waiting for where's some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even
been there you know they weren't a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay
oh i'll bet they did
well you know why they actually held them off
none of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar [laughter]
now you didn't hear me say that outside of um
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
boy don't tell that to a native Texan though i mean my God they fought and won the whole thing
ooh
that's a beautiful state that's a beautiful state see i was raised in the Midwest which you know hell we didn't even you know
we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was and besides you know if corn didn't grow there it didn't matter
Iowa and Nebraska
yep and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so you know what does that make me an honorary Yankee or
God knows what
[laughter] well then she's going to come out well rounded but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i've really gotten into reading
i think this is because the kids are getting to me
is science fiction
well i've gone to the point where my husband my husband travels i get out like you know two or three books
and i i'm trying to think of
oh Isaac Asimov Robot series
i mean i think i've read all four of them and i understand that there's a fifth in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot
you know i think i read Hawaii when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i- i tried to read
i don't remember which other one it was whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more i thought i can't do this
yeah
no
[laughter] is that a big thick book
what the what the hell for why Kingsley Iowa
oh okay
well
now that's one
that's one i don't know see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh
somebody gave me Mist of Avalon probably about five or six years ago i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy
well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh God this would have been even long ago because i was in Boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading Dune
which seeming rather ironic
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little Freeman Steel suits and
i think that's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read and the movie was awful oh yes it was just terrible
it was it was beyond [vocalized-noise]
i don't know i just remember Sting was in it
yeah and if you were trying to follow any type of uh
plot it it tot- even having read the book and i've read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldn't figure out what they were talking about
at all
i was real disappointed in that well i'll tell you another good book do you like scary [noise] things
have you
that's true have you read The Silence of the Lambs
ooh
well see i'm i'm debating whether or not i want to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling
then i won't tell you
[laughter] it's just that if you're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits
that's the one yes
yes because the cha- the the character that is so horrible is another human being And you're just drawn into his
[noise] his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him
that [noise] i mean
no no This guy's smart and he's suave and he's all the charac- all the characteristics yeah all the characteristics
[noise]
so what type of restaurant do you like
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
uh-huh yeah
yeah now do In- are Indian foods kosher
uh-huh
right
[laughter] i i was about to say i didn't think so but most of the most of the [vocalized-noise] the vegetarian Indian meals
uh-huh
um-hum
oh definitely Chinese would uh-huh
um-hum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah
which is of what no we don't have one uh-huh
you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everyt- when we go someplace they have to have good French fries
if they don't have good French fries you know if it's one of if it's a place that has other things if it's not that then we go to Chinese food you know i order
you know a beef and broccoli or chick- or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders um bean curd
and and vegetables right [laughter] you know so um you two would probably eat real well together
uh-huh yeah she she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah
well we really ca- we really don't do that that often um i i guess recently we did um
i get when we got engaged last summer um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the Annapolis area which is um
Annapolis Maryland it it's uh state capital but it's also on the water so there's a lot of restaurants there it's uh it's a um
very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in Annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it's French
but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes
and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but
yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um
we either go Mexican because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of Mexican chips or Mexican pizza or something like that or French fries
you have to you have to have French fries with just about every meal unless you're eating something other you know some other uh
right yeah in fact um since Balti- i see i'm not a [vocalized-noise] you don't know the Bal- Baltimore's on the water and wha-
um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i don't know if you're even aware of it it's what they used on the
uh if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs
okay well old bay is the spice they put on
the steamed crabs well true male Maryl- Maryl- Marylander's have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their French fries they'll put it in their potato salad they'll um
they'll they'll put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have French fries they have to ha- they have to have old bay on them
right yeah yeah well see i i grew up in Pittsburgh uh where Heinz ketchup is and my family is big ketchup yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah we do the same
uh-huh
no you get a couple ye- cou- yeah
it's not a real meal
um-hum
um
[vocalized-noise]
yeah we're the same because i'm in graduate school and we're living off her salary
and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars
and that's you know that's the two of us having un- unlimited French fries
and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries
then i- i'll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she'll just have the French fries you know
no no in fact i- we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste
and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more
but um yeah but she w- she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store
we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
well that's a really good idea
yeah
um-hum yeah we we've used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top
probably for the past oh i don't know six months
yeah so so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it's terrible now because um i guess we've donated money to a number of organizations and you know we're in school i'm in school and we're
barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars
yeah and when you say but we're in c- uh we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so
uh-huh yeah we do all we can now
but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really -ve we really look at restaurants now there's one other little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is um
sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that's five fifty
but if you go to a fast-food restaurant you're going to spend four fifty and you're going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place
uh-huh
yeah
i do too
um-hum
yeah i i agree yeah yeah
no uh-huh
oh
oh
jeez i'll tell L- i'll tell Laura about that
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's because m- that's really see because a lot of times we'll order a pizza we'll just get a regular cheese pizza or um uh for we just recently got married so my wife
got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a KitchenAid or something like that it's called so she's make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it
and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizza's probably one of my fav- most favorite food yeah and she'll make that for the weekend and she'll make you know we'll have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and um
mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and her's will be you know something
uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i- i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i don't think she's ever probably thought of that
uh-huh
yeah so it's it's just regular it's just tomatoes uh-huh
[noise]
basically well i'm a vegetarian um and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a a lot of the restaurants we select are um
based on the variety of food i don't particularly like to sort of American you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants
um i i love ethnic foods i love um Chinese Indian Tai
well as long as you're not eating meat um it's to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher
and um most Indian places don't have a rabbi the places that we eat [laughter] right so um
yeah exactly vegetables and and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do yo- you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and and even
if like you know you could go to a Chinese restaurant and eat the right um Italian you know that
right
yeah and even um one of my favorites is El Torito's i don't know if you have that it's Mexican it's like a Chi-Chi's
really why
oh yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
oh really [laughter]
uh-huh
oh tofu [noise]
um-hum [laughter]
we certainly would if if
oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more uh
um-hum
uh-huh um-hum
right
[noise]
oh
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
crepes yeah
yeah [laughter] so she's the daring one in the family as far as food goes [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
[laughter] unless you're eating like a baked potato or something [laughter]
yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish um yeah
uh-huh
[noise]
no
sure yeah i have heard of that
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
[laughter]
i see it's sort of like some people and ketchup yeah
uh-huh
oh really
oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don't go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there
and i'll go there for you know two months straight we won't go anyplace else
and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then i'll find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because um
i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons
exactly but a salad bar that's that's my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and there's usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it's a lot of vegetables but um
um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh
[noise]
um-hum
oh that's good
that's very good [noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh um-hum
oh really
now is she does she like um McDonald's French fries oh okay
oh
um-hum
um-hum
yep
well that's great
it just more yeah i know what you mean
yeah
oh do you
but still uh-huh
well you know it's funny that you say that because um our grocery store uh i personally i think the grocery stores in Rochester are very they'll allow you to bring your own like um Tupperware thing like your own container
to fill it up i think that's great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that
[noise] it really is i was very happy about that because i [vocalized-noise] you know i feel the same way you do [noise]
um-hum
[noise] oh that's great that really is g-
um-hum
yeah
oh jeez
oh man
[laughter]
great how to say no [noise] and your like you'll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um-hum yeah
yep yep
uh-huh
[noise]
[noise] yep
a lot more waste yeah
um-hum that true
uh-huh well i i don't usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like it's a salad or something at McDonald's but i do rely on pizza a lot
um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something
is like gourmet [laughter] i mean i just you know what i mean it's just fun it's convenient um uh the uh i don't know if you've ever heard of Pizzaria [vocalized-noise]
okay well they just they'll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called Spinoccoli and what it is is um normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli
and it's really really good and i feel like
yeah tell her about that um and i feel like i'm getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldn't eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um
so i
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
really
um-hum
cashews or something like that right
um-hum
well Spinoccoli she can't patent the idea though because Pizza Inn alr- already has it but it's a it's very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then
[noise]
do you have a favorite basketball team
the Lakers LA
okay
uh how they doing this year i'm not i haven't even been following them very much
i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee
that's that's where i'm from [laughter] so
Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley they're not going anywhere
yeah
they do they always seem to get the talent there
well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game
uh-huh
do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year
[laughter]
you don't like Mike Dunleavy
yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had
well Dunleavy's a good coach though he was
yeah
we-
he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude
no i'm pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because he was an assistant at Milwaukee
uh yeah and he uh wh- when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played
they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he's assistant coach
the guy knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers
oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks
and the NIT semifinals are on tonight
uh-huh
yeah right
so are any of those teams of interest to you
oh yeah well [laughter] they're they're just
Larry Johnson
right well they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year
oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games
right
well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that's almost half of a pro season
it's too many for students
right
they're talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball
they have an honor system there where they wou- they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess b- they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished
send them out by Federal Express and fax machine
yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament
but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles fr- from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yep
i don't know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then
i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points
Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far
uh they beat Arkansas yeah
Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half
they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers
yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore
and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won th- the championship
but i don't think they
yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars
well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing
guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old
Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now
but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior
i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year
uh-huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating
well maybe not graduating but at least they'll be entering the the pro draft
oh yeah for sure yeah
[vocalized-noise]
George Akals and Stacy Augmon
Anderson Hunt
uh-huh
uh well i wouldn't say that i- i think
yeah
their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros
there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year
they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think
they've got some great players on that team
i just think that yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately
last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem
uh-huh
sure
i think Houston's playing really good ball lately
ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem [laughter] he added the H to the front
well uh i can understand that it's uh [laughter] i don't know why he dropped it in the first place but uh
sure
so who do you think's going to win the NBA this year
Port- Portland's looking awfully good
Isiah Thomas Detroit
Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year
they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then
Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan
and i think they finally put things together
yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs
i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent
oh yeah
it's not true they have a good supporting cast
Boston Celtics right
yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year
they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old
he's still playing center
and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year
yeah
but they're bringing in some good young players too
which is good
i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year
they have to get by Detroit and Chicago [laughter] i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them
but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago
uh-huh
right
[noise]
Lakers
[laughter]
yes i'm from LA
[laughter]
they're okay they're not um out of anything yet they're still hanging in there
yeah
[laughter] yeah
yeah that's about the i like the Lakers and uh Mavericks are okay but they they got a lot of problems [laughter]
and see i don't think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and that's not good Lakers got so many different players
um-hum i guess that's why i like them
yeah
yep i'm not too much of a basketball fan but you know i watch a l- i watch different games like
play-off games and stuff like that
no
[laughter] not since they're coach is gone
no
huh-uh Mike Riley was it and that's
he's good it's just he's not he's not Riley and i think that's the biggest problem is eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other
huh-uh [laughter] would uh
oh was he
oh my goodness
huh-uh
that's all right then
huh
boy you you like basketball though don't you
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah see now i watch the the Final Four
once it gets down to like the Final Four
UNLV i like them
i guess because well that guy is from Dallas that's probably about the only thing yeah that's it that's the only reason why i don't know anybody else [laughter]
are they really
but then you know just like that man said in this fin- in these in the NCA- whatever it is the little play-off games they play so many sometimes i do think it's going to be more it's luck and ambition you know
yeah
see that's
that's too many games
you know and and then they supposed to be studying
you know [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
are you serious
uh-huh
hum
i don't think that's good
uh-huh
yeah i don't think that's i don't think that's good
that and then you know the laptop that's how i guess they really stuck it on a disk
the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette
and just have them take it but then who's helping them
see now that's [vocalized-noise]
yep
in that the other one that up- that was an upset was Kansas last night
when they
yeah i didn't think they was going to beat that team i don't remember the team but they shouldn't have beat them
i didn't uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas
yeah
and it was like they just died or something you know [laughter]
[laughter]
huh-uh and
that's it
um-hum see now that's the that's the thing now
everybody's waiting for UNLV
and see if Kansas if Kan-
yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i- i feel like the college you know it's ki- it's still kids
so
yeah
they just take them out
think that
that'd be all right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
who
he's
yeah he's coming out in the pros this year
um-hum
i do- i think i think he's going to move i think he'll probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros
and uh
there's some more that i don't i can't think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that guy you know and she'll name them for me [laughter]
yeah now they'll come out in the pros
they'll come out
they're half they're team is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for next year with UNLV they're not going to have no team
well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know
yeah he's nice
uh the Clippers [vocalized-noise] that's another team and i don't think they've ever done anything
but um no coaching
yeah that's all right
that be all right between them and
then there's that uh let's see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too
i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the th- i think it was last year when they uh
l- last year they beat LA last year
yeah
because i know my sister's in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LA's going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down [vocalized-noise] so what happened it took them a long time they beat them
but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games
for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter] his attitude [laughter] i don't know i don't know them people
i don't either
if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that's your name that's your name
[laughter]
hopefully i don't think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh what's his
no not Portland what's that team [noise] with the little guy wi- uh the no Isiah
yeah
i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll
but i think that's what usually happens to them
um-hum
yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty
so they they was playing real good last night
yeah
i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him
you know they because they always think it's all him and see there's not you know
that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics
yeah see because they put a lot on Larry Bird
um-hum
hum-um
yep
[laughter]
well he's out i mean he's hurt this year
so you know you never know
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by b- uh Atlanta
well that's what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta
it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldn't be that much different
you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um
they got wh-
uh-huh
okay
yeah
[laughter]
yeah i i'm i'm pretty busy myself i'm in graduate school at [vocalized-noise] State and i
i can't see even having time for a pet let alone children
but um
yeah i think day care seems to be uh
a real big issue
yeah well actually there's been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the stu- the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time
so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don't have real good uh role models
um-hum
yeah
yeah
i can i can see that happening
yeah
yeah
no
right
um-hum
[laughter]
um
yeah
i think another problem with the families uh
is is the role of television
um i don't know it seems they're using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool
that really that really annoys me because i think i don't know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit [laughter]
um
yeah it's just
go watch TV you know [laughter]
leave us alone
which
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain
i'm watching Ninja Turtles
yeah
yeah i could be
[noise]
[laughter]
i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood
[laughter]
here kid this is this is all you're getting [laughter]
well i- i used to babysit for this family that didn't have a TV and their their kids turned out fine
they they had no TV
no
i mean they had a nice stereo
they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson [laughter]
they just didn't watch him on TV
which i thought was pretty neat
especially the the violence on it
yeah
yeah
yeah
[noise]
i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on they're watching good shows
PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay
if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand
that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesn't happen in real life
yeah
huh
yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards
yeah
yeah
you going to have kids in the future
you going to have kids in the future
okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
i'm still pretty young i'm twenty five but
i don't know i don't see it for for at least a few years [laughter]
no i'm single right now and i'm you know sorting things out which way i'm going to go with my life before i
have kids you know career to to much into my career you know
okay well it's good talking to you
all right bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
um
i think uh
i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson
and from what i understand it's it's a new th- good about families these days um
especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble
because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know
uh-huh
yeah really
there's a lot of single parents too that are trying
yeah
yeah
and uh i'm not sure or i just wonder when we'll know what the effects of day care
yeah
yeah i've heard that they they call them uh that they say that they're more um
creative that they're really just more rebellious
from the day care
because uh the people don't have the time to give that one-on-one attention
and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come
into more and more
uh homes
yeah because
really if you have a good curriculum
do you really need to have that certification
of a teacher i t- i taught school for a year and it was like
whoops you know it's not for me
because i- i just don't have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn
and uh i one day i was i like found myself
uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that [noise] you know something that that's how you know you're a bad teacher [laughter]
[vocalized-noise] [noise]
and i was doing it just keep them occupied
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] using it as a baby a babysitter
yeah
will numb you out
well i've i've heard some uh there's a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control
and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for children's programs
and yet uh children can't buy uh what's the deal
right
[laughter]
i know it
and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous
and they all have to have the same one you know
say
oh yeah
[laughter]
i wonder how long that last
they didn't have a TV at all
were they Pentecostal
[laughter]
yeah they just
[laughter] yeah
yeah
yeah it is
it's very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us
i've
yeah yeah
and you can't control it you you know it's the cable channels sometimes you can but
boy the cable TV they'll just show anything
and that's coming right into your homes
uh-huh
yeah
yeah yeah
and there's a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isn't there
killing their parents and so forth they don't they see these things happening with no consequences
you know
yeah yeah like Double O Seven he's supposed to do it
and it's okay
so i
huh
no huh-uh because i'm like forty three
and so it's uh it's too late
you know i won- sometimes wonder if i'll ever
if i will regret it when i'm old but uh i just can't see myself as a parent
you know it's
really are you married
yeah
yeah
well i wish you the best
it's good talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East
oh i don't think we did really either
well that's that's true yeah
the uh th- the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and
that really hurt the uh the peop- uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one
uh-huh
well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there
yeah that kind of
well that's
um-hum
but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean
isn't it logical that just any of th- that you can solve differences like that
so you
um-hum
so you think it comes down to education or or something like that
[laughter] i suppose that's probably true
um-hum
no
oh
um-hum
yeah because yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad
um-hum
um-hum
right right
um-hum
right
well isn't it also though based on religion i mean isn't that a a real powerful
um-hum well d- don't you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that it's that much harder to get along
um-hum
right right
um-hum
[laughter]
that's true
well since there's not going to be peace over there don't you think like getting involved as we have
that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it
um-hum
it doesn't seem that way does it
um-hum
[laughter] yeah i know
yeah that's probably true
um-hum
um-hum
hum
true they want th- the gas guzzlers yeah
um-hum
[laughter] didn't it though
yeah i- i got to agree with you there i think that does get a lot a lot of good there
um-hum
um-hum
hum United States right
um-hum
let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficial to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it's
people think better about uh the US now
and that's really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think it's going to really help out overall
yeah
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
oh yeah he had some excellent military people
[vocalized-noise] i- i was
the person i was impressed with most i mean i- i really you know Colin Powell and and General Schwartzkopf they're military people but i really didn't know that Cheney was as military minded as he is i mean
that's right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i can't remember where
yeah and see i don't know that and it w- you know i was real impressed with his handling of this i know that
oh yeah
um-hum
[laughter] i don't think very many people are
yeah
um-hum
yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh
yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know [vocalized-noise]
well that's true too yeah
um-hum
um-hum yeah that's true
yeah especially the cost of that an- and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean they're there the- i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible
[laughter] yeah that's probably true
um-hum
[laughter]
so do you think it's you do think it's a good idea for us to have uh
[noise]
i don't think we have any choice
as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it
i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything
i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East
mostly it it just that that region never had had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful
you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews an- the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs
no because you i- i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i- i- i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality
w- well you don't find many intelligent people starting wars you know
you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because they've already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out it's not much fun i've spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean it's not it's not a lot of fun
uh it's as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh
and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world
uh [noise] as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off they're old ancestral enemies and it's pretty you know
it's pretty much that way over the Mideast
and you have the Palestinian question and there hasn't been a Palestine over there for God since you know
two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasn't been one for you know well over two thousand years
but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but it's basically all all based on the a a tribal network
out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family
well they have the same problem we do y- i mean you you know everybody there's Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff it's basically all the same
uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible
you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if you're not a Muslim and and you don't adh- adhere strictly to it
then you're nothing and you're just you're you're just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini
he's a he's a prime example
oh i'd i- i will but seriously doubt th- that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow
well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if we're not involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark
uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but we're not going to do that
no there's there hasn't been any real you know alternating energy sit- situations or or sources played out nobody wants to do it somebody has to make the hard decision and whoever does that will be a one term president
yeah
it's kind of like uh Texas income tax whoever you know whoever puts that up is going to serve one term that's going to be it because your going to be gone they may pass the uh state income taxes but that'll be the last thing they pass
nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions [vocalized-noise] have to do is basically what we're doing now is pick some of the moderate uh Arabs or
you know Muslims as [vocalized-noise] and uh support them because they're because they will have more uh encounter with us as far as the educational and sociological economic background goes
if you look over there you're not going to you don't see any Arabs driving uh
racing cars
they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns
yeah so you know who's who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that we're not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground
you know and uh we we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were and
where did they get the uh where where does the expertise come for for bringing a whole lot of ground and it d- doesn't come from Russia and it doesn't come from Europe it c- comes from the United States
who's going to put out their oil fires the United States
we have the technology when we have the people and we go do it and i think we're going to i think we're going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on
[vocalized-noise] i- i- i agree a hundred percent on that a- after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasn't meant to be one he'd attacked
and that's the way you're supposed to do it instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did you know say w- you know uh um i'm getting out of the olympics and i'm going to give you back Panama
you know i mean you either make your stand or you don't if you can't back it up just don't say anything
and everything Bush said he backed up of course he course he had some real good help
yeah it's like [vocalized-noise] and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart they're a lot smarter that any body gives credit for
Cheney's hard core you don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp
but he'd served in the military
oh yeah the whole i mean the whole thing was done well it was just you know
it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway
but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was
i guess it was i'm not used to having them over in six days you know really just kind of gosh we just got started good i guess the Israelis might be over it you know uh you know because they had a seven day war at one time but uh
although i- i wish instead of turning south you know an- taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished we'd just turned left and gone toward Baghdad
i think we should have because because we're go- if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly
but the only thing that'll save that is we won't get the credit for or the blame for the massacre an- and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because you know someone asked us to
and of course now's the time to do it because since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them out and then turn right around send them back over again
oh yeah they shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet
they jus- you know jus- just level the whole place and let it go but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there [noise]
you know in the Jimmy Car- uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me
[noise]
okay the topic said to discuss the weather what is it like where you are and how's that different from normal and
[laughter]
[laughter]
well let's see if you're in Plano and i'm in Plano are you in east Plano or west Plano
okay well i'm in east Plano i'm out in Las Rios so it's bound to be different over here but yeah yeah
[laughter]
oh
got a little sunburn yeah
wow
i worked around in the yard a little bit and
i've got sunburned a few years ago and you know got one of those what second or third degree burns and the doctor looked at it and said don't ever
don't ever let that area get sunburned again
and uh it's got the you know the kind of the black freckled things on it that the doctor looks at every once in a while for that what melanoma business [vocalized-noise]
so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid i'm out there in a T-shirt and everything else
pretty much covered up but uh you know i'm never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again
um-hum
well it is March after all you know you're not supposed to worry about sunburn in March
[laughter]
that's right
yeah
well yeah i hope so yeah we're going to go to Lubbock they'll probably have another sandstorm out there you know
big Lubbock yeah [vocalized-noise] are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or
okay well well where did you come from originally
oh okay well i'm a Tech graduate so
yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell
and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is
it's on the it's on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like you're headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there
uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line
so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah i'm [laughter]
okay yeah i know where Panhandle is that's north up there isn't it yeah
yeah
yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas
so
yeah so anyway yeah we're kind of familiar with that part of the world now there's where the weather's interesting i think it's kind of dull around here compared to
yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadn't had one like that in a couple of years
[laughter]
yeah i recall a snirtstorm out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit
and uh
i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen
yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuque- Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here
and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock
and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there
ended up coming back but uh
yeah the weather out there was uh-huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again
uh-huh
well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four
oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then
um-hum
with the ice yeah
well the uh
was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or
where
y- yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off
yeah that was that was bad news we're still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed them
well they all come back from from the bottom
so i'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally here there's no sense in planting it because eventually you're going to lose it
and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees
[laughter]
they're they know better [laughter] they know better [laughter] yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well you're just about there i think it's
um-hum
well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was semi-in but there was still a lot more to do
and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world
well [noise] i am somewhat less than enthused about that i've got some out here that's
five six years old now and still doesn't look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in
and then and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn't work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they're pushing something else
yeah [laughter]
yeah
well anyway uh like i said if it if it doesn't grow out in the woods here somewhere i'm not sure
[vocalized-noise] plant yeah
this uh photinia
the red tipped photinia
it seems to do pretty good we've got some here that's really taken off
um-hum
that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right
we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they're
they weren't native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and
and uh
yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because right now is when it's dropping it's leaves
and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no
but you look look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it's leaves all winter then loses them in the spring
that and that red what is it red oak
we're thinking about putting one of those in
uh-huh
well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that
but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow because they don't get the water they don't get the they're they're growing under bad conditions
and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree
so yeah
so anyway that's that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don't know
whether the live uh live oaks is not really an oak i guess it's something [vocalized-noise]
oh
yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it
but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and
pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they'll grow a lot faster
well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that's [laughter]
yeah
well are [vocalized-noise] you with TI
yeah
how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home
okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i
i'd made a couple at work
you know but uh ma- made several from work but i'd never uh i'd never gotten one yet i was just
yeah
yeah
[noise]
well
[laughter] you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're going to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody
like you know [laughter] New York or something yeah
yeah weather difference between east and west Plano
[laughter]
clear across town
well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights
you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the
downtown but uh that's not the way Plano works
[noise]
well i tell you what it is it's warm where i'm at [laughter]
uh west Plano
okay [laughter]
good deal well i tell you what uh yesterday i went out and played a little golf and uh i paid the price my neck got got burned to a crisp
yeah
but uh it was it was beautiful out
oh Lord
[laughter]
yeah
right
exactly
all covered up [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
well i tell you i'm the same way i tell you i- i knew better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday but i don't know it felt so nice out
well that's right that's right they shouldn't even be selling suntan lotion yet
but uh hopefully uh you know it's going to stay warm for this weekend
and uh
[laughter] so you're going to go to the big city of Lubbock huh yeah
no i just been uh up here in Plano for about uh i guess close to three years now and uh
i grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and uh then when i went to school at Tech there in Lubbock
are you okay
i see
i've heard of Plains yeah
right
i see okay
well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle
yeah yeah
right right right up there by Amarillo
so uh
okay yeah on the other side of Amarillo yeah
well that's right because uh one day it'll be eighty and the next day it'll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh
oh Lord
[laughter] that's one thing i do not miss about uh being in Lubbock i tell you
because one i i'll never forget uh one spring we had a real big dust storm come in and it started raining and uh it was like raining mud out there you know
and uh
[laughter]
oh Lord [laughter]
right
that's exactly right i tell you
right
[laughter]
i see
oh it sure can because uh the you never just you just can never tell what it's going to do
and uh it's just hard to plan anything
uh that i did
this
okay
yeah uh my first year down here uh uh that first winter i remembered TI was closed one one day uh
that yeah with the ice but that uh that's about the worst worst winter i've been been through down here
yeah where it got just real real cold
yeah
right [laughter]
oh Lord
right
that's right because the weather's going to get it exactly
that still don't have any leaves on them yet that's right that's exactly right
and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house and we're trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in
and uh i'm still trying to decide when when the best time's going to be to do that so uh
that's that's right you know i'd i'd like to get the yard in before all the rain start and uh you know if we could get it up a little bit and then the rain would really just help it
i see
right
[laughter]
oh is that right
right
oh Neil Sperry hasn't been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter] that's worth planting huh
that's exactly right
[vocalized-noise] red tipped bush yeah
well yeah i- i- i know everybody in our neighborhood has has those bushes and uh
like i say really seem to to do well
right ho- yeah
right
they sure have and that's a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and
right
[laughter] the thing's dying
right
yeah
red oak yeah
only thing is those things grow pretty slow you have to
right
oh is that right
yeah
so if you really fertilize it and
huh well that's surprising
that's good to know
right right
i think it's just by name yeah
right right
yeah huh
[laughter] at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah
but uh
yes i am yeah
um probably about three i guess yeah
i see
right
gotten one at home huh yeah i've gotten about three i guess
so
split it up a little bit
like New York or somewhere yeah that's right
but uh
exactly [laughter]
clear across town but uh
right
[laughter]
well how how do you feel about the immigration laws
yeah well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws
[noise] oh
uh-huh
hum
no that doesn't make a whole of lot sense
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
well uh my uh my family is from uh [noise] Europe from well from England and Ireland
and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years
so i don't have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh [noise]
several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here
so i don't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws i don't because i don't
i don't have any personal feelings about them and i i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i- i
well i agree with that i- i think if [vocalized-noise] immigration was entirely unrestricted
uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly
i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime
i was not aware aware of that
uh-huh
yeah
i think so [laughter]
well i've enjoyed talking to you
okay [laughter] thanks
bye-bye
at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um
i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example
uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years
and i think we have uh uh
too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also
but of course that's just my opinion [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh
there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh
or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh
uh we should be of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from Eastern Europe so
and uh
so i think uh you know the [noise] um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we s- of uh
spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we
simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so
i do not quite go along with that but [laughter]
no
and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh
uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so
i'm a little touchy [noise] every now and then about that [laughter]
um-hum
oh my [laughter]
uh-huh
well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh
although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um
i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um
some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh
you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over
so you know [laughter] but uh
i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh
is not best uh
um-hum well you know there's another aspect of this too they're also uh
uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which
well yes there are were some uh
regulations over i don't know whether they're laws passed or or whatever they're called uh just recently where
uh
people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh
tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also
so i think in in s- some as- some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh
i think we should be a little more circumspect about it
again my opinion [laughter]
think we've talked long enough
[laughter] all right
or i- i- i have talked long enough
[laughter]
[laughter]
thank you
good-bye
[noise]
[noise] okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far
but anyway i- i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that
we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money
um we're probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems
um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think uh
anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now so yeah
um-hum
yeah
right i think it's seven here or seven point something
[noise] [laughter] yeah
um-hum [noise] right do where are you at what state
oh really yeah there's we're still we still one of few that don't have the uh state tax taxes
yeah that's true
y- yeah i do i've lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm
yeah
no no i've just lived here but
i don't know i- i do i can think of all the uh
the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of this the scripture Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's so
you know even uh
i think even in the the story where uh they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish
and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah
right
right
right get in yeah
oh sure
sure
right
um-hum right
yeah are
no not really i- i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year
um i have been married for just a few years so i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that
yeah it really did i- i saw that too
right right that's we're looking at buying a house and that's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah yeah you kn- there's a a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it
i- if you pay i- i know i get paid twice a month uh every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months
so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a
uh one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note
oh yeah
um-hum
right yeah
right
right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or u- usually it doesn't anyway
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not going to go longer than twenty
but we're taking our time we're going uh try to make our decision by July
so and we just started like two or three weeks ago and we're not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most
and
yeah
uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so that's
i don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now
but anyway well um i can't think of a whole lot more to say
yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife [vocalized-noise] uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married
i guess before i even met her but
okay
but anyway i just yeah she went to school there at uh Cathy Walker
no yeah but she
yeah thanks a lot you y'all work at TI you you do okay oh really wow that's interesting i work in the wa- in the wafer fab- in
oh really yeah
oh wow
[noise] yeah
yeah i'm i'm uh turning in a capital request right now yeah that's funny that's that's where you're from uh a machine that puts
back grind tape on and off the wafers
yeah i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah
right and do most for
oh i like him he's um he's hard but i we i think we needed that
and he's i mean he
um-hum
yeah that's that's what he said here he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before
and that's that's [vocalized-noise] been a real big plus and he's broadened our um the devices that we're making too
which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you and they're are going to interrupt us any minute now i can tell
okay yeah me too y- well you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
well i have to agree that [laughter] and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things
that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a
i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending
um i don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a
the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California
and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation
yeah
yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about
we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it
so
[noise] i'm in Lubbock Texas yeah
that's true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay
know you don't sound like you're from Dallas where do you co- do you come from originally Texas or
oh okay
you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
yeah
that's right
yeah
oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the [vocalized-noise] would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would make him contradict himself
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you know you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh
a- you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something [laughter]
but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to
you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do
where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or
schedule A well yeah and you know
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder [laughter]
i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and [laughter] other things
yeah
and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
that's right
that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago
and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that
uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year
yeah so that's
that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner
yeah
yeah
well that's good though
yeah
well that's good though is it kind of a buyers market down there you'll be
well that's good
that's pretty excellent
that's good
well i can't either i appreciate the call though
i enjoyed talking to you
in Lubbock
[noise] Breyiana Breyiana look at me please just a second be quite please i can not hear i will talk to you in just a second go ahead so she went to school out here
what was her name
no i didn't know any Walker's
well good luck in your house hunting
i do yeah i'm in human resources yeah
do you really see that okay i worked with uh with Elma
yeah and uh i used to work i- i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years
and then i've just been in Human Resources the last two years and i work with those same people that i worked with all those nine years so i feel kind of part of the staff [laughter]
you are
what are you trying to get
oh
okay so you work in back grind
oh okay
that's what you do huh and Demos four
well good deal what do y'all think of Sam
well that's good
he was very good for Lubbock when he came to he d- you know it was the same kind of thing he he he had a lot of good results
good
well good
good
oh okay
well that's good
well you too and
well i know they will and besides that my daughter wants me to put her to bed so [laughter] well have a good day bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
[noise]
first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments
yes
gross national product or profit okay
i'm not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what you're saying
um-hum
seems fair to me [laughter] also individual level
um-hum
well i am awfully bored with uh every
every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because
i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft
and so much misspending that that money doesn't necessarily go where it's supposed to go
uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the
welfare dollar needs to come back t- to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money when it's directed from afar
i think the chance for misspending is greater
i i suppose i'm thinking more in terms i i'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes i'm just thinking for a quick fix
uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution
i know [laughter] that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though
right
um-hum
um-hum
i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician
but we do don't we
yes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you
uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway
yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them a lifetime thing
it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't they
at least we're in agreement on that aren't we [laughter] i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow
um-hum
how do they react then
we're prosecuted if we simply don't pay our taxes so i'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow
we know communism doesn't work what do we do next
uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority say- speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the
that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think
the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is
slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess i'm saying we're all selfish
yes that's true
it doesn't seem to workout that way though does it i think that the lobbyist uh
are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing
because of the kickbacks and et cetera
i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid
you're younger perhaps you can foresee one
um-hum
um-hum
yes i think you're right i'm just saying that i don't think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime
yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system
uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh
it's working right now though
absolutely [laughter] nice talking to you
bye
[noise]
[noise]
now dealing on the federal level
two perc- two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder
where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product
or their or their
profit rather
[noise]
if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent
if their gross
national profit
was
say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that
but the um
overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people
middle class and
you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden
as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kick-
kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen
the one thing that i
had thought about
to help correct that problem you've got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington that's all they have ever done
after they've been there that long they're so deep rooted with their the old boy network
i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman
or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one
i don't think we should ever give them a lifetime income
unfortunately
and they're the ones that have screamed so mu- m- much about
that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise
i th- eventually it's going get to the point where
there's going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's
finally come to we're
you getting so far down to where
you're being taxed so far down where you can't even afford to change your mind
it's going to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough
well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either
maybe not a case of everybody being selfish
every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody else's
i never put anything beyond
as far as when it'll happen
that i'm not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt
it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point
okay nice talking to you bye
[noise]
[noise]
huh-uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants
and right now in our area were fighting against a uh toxic waste incinerator
and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody's really been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don't want one any place
we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh
waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh
the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much
you know the uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
oh that has to be terrible over there
huh-uh
huh-uh
yeah
huh-uh
yeah yeah and we're breathing it we're we're breathing it all the time
um-hum [laughter] um-hum
no and i i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So
and they've shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that that they have
uh they've reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things
and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more
but once they get started it's really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way
and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it
huh-uh
huh-uh
they're greedy it's money is what it is it's it's the money
they're making fantastic amounts of money on these things and uh even the the incinerators
the money and the income that they're going to make off of this is
you know just astronomical
we've never been we went as far as like uh Las Vegas [laughter] and Yellow Stone Park we we didn't go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn't
but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and [vocalized-noise] and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw
she said they couldn't see those things out there
because of the smog and everything else
no i've never been in New York [laughter] i don't want to go there [laughter]
have you been there
oh
um no i never heard of that one
we're near Pittsburgh uh Clarion University
it's kind of n- kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania
huh-uh
you sound very young are you a young person
thirty one you're young [laughter]
[laughter] no you're young you have a lot of life yet and and these we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution
uh older people or
they think they're far enough away from something
that it's and they don't realize that these things are going to affect everybody and if if you're older and it's not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends
uh everybody is going to be affected by it
huh-uh
huh-uh
they say it has really made a difference though
now see we don't have that here yet
no we don't have uh that testing in that down here yet
but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater
and that it has made a big difference
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
something's coming out yeah
yeah
yeah
if if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little m-
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry
we're paying industry to make the products and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace
then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again
now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted
or the the where they want to put the the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds th- that feed Clarion river
and [vocalized-noise] you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because
if that water gets contaminated it will go on down into Pittsburgh it will you know it it it affects so many people
and it's just hard to think that they could allow
them to do things like this
huh-uh
it really is
it is really a big concern
its a
huh-uh
um-hum
well you too
huh-uh [noise] bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i um i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities i mean i'm living in Dallas now Plano is outside of Dallas but um
so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution
but i know when i lived down in Houston um on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries
and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something
there would just be dumping this huge amounts of
smoke into the air and and it always smelled really bad we know that that was
really um really really bad for the atmosphere
what have you got up there
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh no
sure
yeah
and it's just i mean
it's just so bad that there is just so much
going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up
and plus all the problems in
uh the Middle East with all that smoke and stuff and
yeah so it's just um you know why are why are we doing this to ourselves i just don't know but um i you know what really [vocalized-noise] amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries is
that there would be houses and people living just really close to it i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood and
you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down and
and we
yes and and how you know if they have all of those um
toxicity
i mean it there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living [laughter] close t- next to it doesn't make too much sense
huh-uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
um-hum
um-hum
well um individual companies and things are so selfish and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they don't care about the environmental impact that they make
[noise]
uh-huh
yes
um-hum
well have you ever visited um like Los Angeles or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air
um-hum
uh-huh
well it's
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
that's so awful
well what about in New York i guess you've gone that way maybe [laughter]
[laughter] yeah pretty funny
well i've been to New York i have um relatives that direction i have it's um where are you clo- is it close to Phoenix- Phoenixville Pennsylvania
because i have family there and
oh huh-uh
it's pretty neat
that's beautiful country up that way i know it's um
very lush and pretty up in the back in the east it's really
well i'm thirty one
[laughter] seems kind of old to me [laughter]
huh-uh
um-hum
yes
that's really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and
how they've had to how it's so much more expensive and things and i thought well it's so much better
uh-huh
oh you don't
hum
uh-huh
[noise]
well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are
and each is putting out like we have a car an older one of our cars is an older car and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement
and you know that that is a sign that it
yeah and that's all all cars are doing that and it's really polluting the air
huh-uh and it's also that
it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things
we sure wouldn't want
so much more people suffering from that
huh-uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
pretty sad
oh no
huh-uh
um-hum
no no it's scary [laughter] it's scary
it's really awful well i've really enjoyed the conversation it's helped me to think more about
some issues that i need to be thinking more about [laughter]
huh-uh
and it's you know uh instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it's important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day
thank you
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay [laughter]
they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping
oh i can camp just about most anyway [laughter] camping or uh
motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up
oh really
oh
you really rough it then
uh-huh do you do that very often
uh-huh
uh-huh
you'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area
yeah
that would be really great
pardon
uh-huh that sounds like it'd be fun did you go alone or with a group or
uh-huh
uh-huh oh that's great long as it's not raining
[laughter]
um-hum
really
oh that would
uh-huh well i'm in Pennsylvania
yes [laughter]
are you in Texas now
oh okay
most everybody i've been talking to is from Texas but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania
uh-huh well you kind of know what it's like then
yeah but we've uh we've done uh
many types of camping we've we've done tent camping and
we had access to a motor home which is really super great [laughter] if you don't want to rough it too much
and uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the o- ocean most every year
and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks
and uh we really enjoyed that
huh
oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better
[laughter]
oh but
yeah well we used to we don't as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit
[noise] but uh
i think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping
then it can be kind of bad
uh-huh
i don't think i would like that what kind
oh those aren't too pleasant
yeah we have some of them around here
you probably have more there though i would imagine
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh but you still backpacked and camped out
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing yeah
yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh is your brother younger than you or
uh-huh uh-huh
well that's great that'd be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah
did you really
what black ones
yeah
that would be exciting
[laughter]
y- yeah they're usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually
they're on the increase in this area
um-hum
the black bear oh yeah yeah the population's been r- really up they've uh
they've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
uh-huh
yeah
but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh
we ha- we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh
yeah yeah
it's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh gett- you know getting ready and taking care of everything but it's um
it's really refreshing
so
i think so [laughter]
well it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it
okay thanks a lot and you have a good day okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
yeah what do you where do you like to camp how do you like to camp
i used to uh live in the Ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods
yeah
i haven't done it in quite awhile since i moved down here But i used to do it
quite a bit
yeah yeah it was real hilly
take a twenty two and go out
take a twenty two and find a creek
i used to go with my brother we just lived up there
yeah
it gets kind of i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in
get out of the rain
but i don't know much about camping in Texas
you're in Pennsylvania
i didn't know they did this [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah i'm down here at TI
i used to be in Ohio it's some pretty country up there
so
yeah you can get the
they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out
just set it up and get out of get out of the city for awhile
tell you what i'm losing you
i said i'm losing you you're getting fa- you're fading out
yeah that's
so what you try take a vacation every year and go out and camp
yeah
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks
that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping
uh Copperheads mostly
no they're
yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i don't know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was
just Copperheads everywhere
yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to
pretty much hike out most of the time
if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could
you just get used to it
yeah
yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more
yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to [noise] sack out
yeah he's about a year and a half younger
yeah yeah it was
saw a few bears
things like that
yeah
yeah the first first couple of times it's pretty scary but uh
after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so
but
oh really
i don't know if they don't have them up there do they
yeah oh do they
yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them i don't know what it's like now i haven't been back up there in awhile
well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too
so
yeah
well i think we're about to run out of our time
yeah
yeah i'm sure i will
you too bye
[noise]
well since you live close i don't know if you know um about what Lewisville's doing with recycling are you familiar with any of that
um
yeah i you know i read you know when they first started doing that in the paper and i read about that i was just praying that that you know that would be in our area because we've been recycling for quite sometime and
[noise] you know we separate everything out and then have to haul it up to Almetco you know which is a real pain so if they would come up with curbside recycling that would be [noise]
[noise] well now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart oh gosh [laughter]
oh well that's really nice to know because we were doing the same thing because to take it to Almetco you have to take it when they're open you know which is always a real pain [noise]
and so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart's parking lot we thought oh this is great and we started taking it up there and then all the sudden it disappeared you know i didn't real-
[noise] and we're going oh no there's our goes our recycling place well that's really nice to find out that it's behind there
[noise] well we pretty much do um uh plastic milk cartons and um um
um newspapers i couldn't even think of what you call them plastic milk cartons and newspapers an- and cans and glass i guess is the is really the four things that we do
uh yeah yeah
and really i think that's about th- that's really about it is there anythi- anyplace else that really takes anything other than that that you know of
oh really
i know i know we're kind of the same way [noise] an- you know a- at first i don't know about you at first it was a real
it was a real hassle and i'm going are we really gonna do this but you kind of get i guess into a little routine you know and it just be- kind of is automatic now to to throw different things in different places you know
so i've just got you know we have a a pantr- pretty good size pantry in our kitchen and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there you know and we just kind of dump things in each one as you know as we get them so
they do too and they're impossible to crush i mean you can't get them down to any size you know i mean you know you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag you know pretty easily so yeah you-
oh really
yeah yeah
yeah
oh well that'll be good
sure yeah let somebody get something out of it yeah that's true
yeah yeah ha-ha [laughter] well i was kind of hoping with you kn- do you work for TI
no
yeah there was a uh that TI's got this this organization called TAD which is TIers Against Drugs
and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh you know just what you'd buy out of the machines and drink here and there's crushers out in all of the hallways you know and they're and that's and they use the money from that to fund this
TIers Against Drugs program it's you know TI doesn't give them any money all everything is made from that
and they had talked about having a thing where like one Saturday a month you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home you know
and i'm kind of like you i wish they would do that because so at least i knew somebody you know was getting the money out of it you know that i- was gonna use it for good so
[laughter]
[noise] sounds like you have a little one just like i do
yeah mine was two in December [laughter] well it was good to talk to you
oh do they really curbside pick up i really hope they do that in Lewisville it'd make it a lot easier on all of us
okay talk to you later bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
well i know that um we have some relatives that live um like around the Deanne area in there i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there
no what i'll do recycle because we a there is some bins like behind Wal-Mart that take some things
yeah because i finally asked because we you know we had all of those milk cartons and there was nowhere else to take them and they had it in front of Wal-Mart and i ask in Wal-Mart and they said they moved it just behind
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
ye-
like aluminum cans or yeah that's about what we do too
well i guess um down in um kind of in North Dallas there's a place that'll take almost anything but
uh i don't just we don't have the room to store all that much you know and i don't want to be running down there every week or whatever i mean
yeah
yeah i do- think those milk cartons take up so much room [laughter] yeah
yeah
no but i guess we kind of we started recycling after we moved here about a year and a half ago an- we were using baby food and there was just so many baby food jars that
that's kind of what started it and plus some of our neighbors were doing it an- you know so when i found out some places to take it
a- and like um they also take some things at um the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there and i know that they're gonna use you know the money for that to build some kind of um
multipurpose field and that type of thing with put lights and stuff you know so you know if i'm not gonna get the money from aluminum i would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound to do something with you know
yeah then maybe they won't raise our taxes to pay for all those yeah so
[noise] no i don't a friend of mine told me about this program is the reason i-
yeah
what's the matter sweetie you need to wash your hands maybe Paw-Paw can help you sure sorry
she's uh she'll be two in July
so
well it was nice talk- to you i know that they've started over in Richardson where my dad lives they pick up newspapers i think [noise] no [noise] so yeah
yeah well i- okay bye-bye
[noise]
okay um
my major source of information i guess is TV news [noise] excuse me
i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work
oh i
quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper
but uh primarily mine is uh TV news
how about yourself
um true
uh-huh
well that's true but uh i
[vocalized-noise] uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news [vocalized-noise] medias were uh
trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military
now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam
uh but
i mean let's face it to- today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give aw- away a
piece of top secret information
and uh
pat himself on the back for for uh
making a big scoop
[laughter] very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI
of course T News i- is more or less headlines uh i don't think much of of their sports coverage
all they give the scores
but uh that's right i'm not
yeah outside of of uh pro football i'm not too interested in other ga- uh other sports anyway
but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items
uh-huh
well i spent twenty years in prof- in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits a- of bits and pieces of news on the air
uh i mean there there are times where uh vide- uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again
and uh [noise] well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the f- fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it
for some reason because he was carrying a camera
uh they left him alone
um-hum
nice talking to you too Jim
no
oh well i'll have to be looking for it then [noise]
is that right well good
you too [noise]
uh tell you what [noise] um i'll let you start or [vocalized-noise] if that's all right
pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you um
normally don't have time in the morning to to watch the any type of TV usually catch it going to work on the radio
or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news [noise] yeah so uh i've kind of um
uh we have a one year old in the house so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch TV during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or um
um those type of issues i'd have to say during the war uh there were we were the American public was probably flooded with um
uh too much information and as far as the sub question about was i s- am i satisfied with the coverage i'd have to say
yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who's telling the truth you c- between the channels there was
uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated
true i agree with you
yeah which is a is a joke [laughter]
um-hum
yeah that's a good point uh but i would have to say across the board i'm i'm satisfied with the way uh
the news is is spread um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretary's probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is [laughter]
yes
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the the head lines uh on T News that's a good point
um-hum
yeah true kind of short [vocalized-noise]
yeah least
um-hum
well that's great
yeah i do surely do
uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the t- television or the radio
um [noise]
yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know
hm
hm
ouch everybody got excited [noise]
that's tough that's tough [noise] well i've enjoyed speaking with you
did you get your catalog on y- your your gifts
oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling [laughter]
yeah they're not to shabby they're pretty good
yes sir
have a great day bye-bye
[noise]
alrighty ladies first
hm
Barney Fife i guess yeah
well some- we- so are you a homemaker i guess that's the the right term nowadays
yeah we- my wife we have a new one in the house and she's she's stays home too also
um i guess i have a wide variety i like watching the TV for things that are interesting not so much the the bor- the uh
the things that aren't for example like the Cosby Show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and and Different Strokes and
but i like Sixty Minutes Prime Time Live um course i have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the Ninja Turtle ones i like the old-timey ones Tom and Jerry
there you go
-t's right Johnny Quest you know the good ones um now i'll if i'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day i'd i have to catch at twelve o'clock the Andy Griffith Show because he's just you know he's one of my idles and then uh
but i don't know it just seems like that nowadays
everything's so electronic you know an- magnified and and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings an- and so uh
uh now i do w- the Cosby Show
i have seen it a couple of times a- and i do
i i like the show i just don't watch it because of the timing but uh some of the crap that's on TV nowadays and
it's bad i do watch the special shows that they come out with th- the Nova stuff and and the nature shows
but um i think there's enough out there to pick from i'm not we don't have cable to the point of of of the HBO or any of that stuff and but uh yeah
um-hum
sure
oh me
oh no
[laughter] ouch fifteen years bet they hated that
oh goodness
yeah really i'll watch oh i- i used to watch uh i can recall though this might age me uh date me here i can remember staying home when i was five and six and my mother watching The Edge of Night
[vocalized-noise]
Secret Storm though i think they were back to back on black and white okay i mean i'm just a youngster and i was like oh my gosh
well you know
still be on yeah
yeah now they got a lot other crap involved and s- i don't know you're right i think some of the tones uh of the the the daily prime time is is questionable that could be uh
i have to agree with you you know keep them on that channel eleven channel twenty one the nature stuff you know [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum hm uh yeah well
well sound like you got your hand fulls there and i do appreciate speaking with you
have you gotten your catalog yet
yeah i just spoke to the gentlem- i just got mine the mail and i inspired me to make more phone calls
oh really
check out your pen number [laughter]
have a good day bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter] oh no well i don't find a lot of time to watch TV and a lot of the time i find it during the day when i'm rocking my little girl to sleep [noise] so i watch a lot of reruns old shows
like Dick Van Dyke and all those old crazy shows
yeah [laughter] i really enjoy watching Andy Griffith
yeah [vocalized-noise]
yeah i guess so yeah i am i stay home with two kids and [noise]
huh
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
[noise]
[laughter] yeah you sound like my husband he really likes Tom and Jerry and uh Bugs Bunny and all his friends and all those guys
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
[noise] yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
well i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because with two kids and you know i don't want them watching something that i don't think they should watch i i used to be really hooked on All My Children and i watched that for like
oh ten or fifteen straight years
and then i had well you know i'd eat like at lunch at work we'd have a TV or whatever and then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on and i thought this isn't really very good
so i gave it up
yeah i had watched it i had watched it since it started so it was kind of but now i'd you know i -idn't know who the characters are and um i'll turn it on every once in awhile don't recognize anybody so i guess that's a good sign
uh-huh
oh yeah well see you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched The Secret Storm and The Edge of Night um-hum uh-huh uh-huh
[noise]
yeah yeah we used to my mother watched all that stuff too and A- As the World Turns i think As the World Turns may s- i don't know if it's still on or not it was s- not too long ago
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
right yeah yeah we do and it's real interesting too the difference in my kids like um my oldest loved Sesame Street and
those kinds of shows my my younger one doesn't she's more into Walt Disney
kind you know we watch a lot of movies that we've got on VC- you know on tapes and stuff she's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing so
but uh we do a lot of kid watching [laughter]
sure it was fun
no i don't think so
oh well see i haven't really i've had a few people call me but i've never made one so yeah i need to get brave [laughter]
[laughter] yeah yeah that's what i need to do
thanks good bye
okay
[laughter]
um-hum
um i think there should be some control but on the same hand i think you should be uh like
a- and some cities i think you should be allowed to carry guns
no i'm not well um
i i'm kind of i'm i'm about two hours north of Pittsburgh
and there's some- i won't sometimes i won't go down there at night you know
no and um my fiance is about an hour of DC and that you wouldn't catch me dead down there
no
um-hum
yeah
exac- yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
no
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
oh i didn't even know that
yeah well that's the way it is i think anywhere
because li- like just in in DC like my fiance said like um he went to the doctors one time and it was located in DC and
he had to park his car you know and his car was like two blocks away from the the clinic
and the clinic had someone escort him to his car
because it got dark it was after sunset
yeah now tha- that's just ridiculous you know i mean that that's just
down right ridiculous and i know driving through Pittsburgh you know we got lost down there one time and we we're trying to come home and um
we went through this one section and there were you know all the people standing on the corner and
and stuff and i was just like well wind up my window lock my door [laughter] you know i was just like don't you dare stop i don't care run the red light just get out of here [laughter]
[laughter]
oh go-
is that's awful
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah exactly like i would call my fiance and
well he moved now so he's in a much nicer area but he lived like twenty minutes out of downtown DC
and i would be talking to him on the phone
and i could hear sirens and i could hear yelling and screaming and i'm like what's going on and he'd go to the window and he'd watch a policeman chase someone down the sidewalk
a- and i'm just like and he and another thing was he lived on the ground floor of an apartment building and i was just like would you please move
[laughter] just get out of there please i
i mean i just don't think it's safe
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
exactly yeah
yeah well um i come from a large family and all my brothers hunt so we have hunting guns
but they're always locked up at all times other than when they're being used and even whenever like you know like
like if three of them are out hunting and there's still three guns left it's still locked you know it's locked all the time but
as far as having anything else to protect ourselves we don't have anything you know other than maybe a butcher knife that's up on the wall you know but what's your chances of getting to it or something
um-hum
yeah but uh i know my um roommate
she's from Latrobe and that's right out of Pittsburgh and her father is a state policeman
and she has mace you know even to carry like i'm i'm at college so
even for her when she goes out at night if her and i are out like if we walk to another building or something we always take the mace with us
y- you know just because you know two girls walking but um her mom sells real state
so her mom has a gun in her purse at all times
because she has to pick up strangers that you know people that she's never met and take them to these houses and they're in her car
so she he taught he has three daughters he taught all three daughters and his wife how to shoot
and and i can very well see his point
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
but then and and you know and sometime- you know i think that like
when whenever i graduate i'll be moving to where my fiance is and i'll definitely want to have something if we're even
a half hour away from DC i will want something you know but then again you know
you would always want to keep it locked up or something then you know well then what's the sense of keeping it locked up because then if something would happen
are you going to have time to actually go and unlock it and g- you know and y- you you hate keeping something laid out like that
oh my gosh
no
why would i i just don't people are sick for doing that
they just wanted his money
um-hum yeah
i- i- gun co- it's just always one of those iffy situations i think people should be allowed to protect themselves
but then you know like you know so many families you know you don't want to let a gun out because accidents do happen
i- if
um-hum
um-hum yeah like i had a neighbor and uh
he got shot in the stomach with a gun and to this day they declare that the gun was not loaded
and i just cannot get that out of my mind now obviously the gun was loaded
you know but to this day they swear the gun was not loaded
and i'm just like well he has half his stomach missing
i i i'm just like well well then where did his stomach go you know [laughter] i mean he survived you know but he was lucky that's all there was to it
uh-huh i i i just think it's an iffy situation
oh what a some subject uh oh
it's it's i think it's almost as bad as religion talking to somebody like gun control with everybody has everybody has such i- ideas on it
what what d- what do you feel about it
really are you from a big city
oh
oh i no no kidding [laughter]
uh-huh
oh no no i
no i i ag- i i solely a- agree with you there i i i think i think automatic weapons
is it's kind of ridiculous if there's not some kind of control on those
because there's no reason to have automatic i- i- i mean i mean deer hunters do not use automatic weapons you can't te- you can't tell me that they're good for anything but but killing people
but um but there there c- you can't take gun you can't put total control because the crimin- the the law abiding citizens won't turn will turn them in and the criminals won't [laughter]
so it's it's a real messy subject it it i- it's there's just doesn't seem to be any good solution even though i do think that the uh
the what's that seven day waiting period till they checkup on you until f- for buying a handgun is a is a really good idea tha- tha- that they're trying to push through Congress right now but uh
i don't think they'll ever get it done
i i just i really don't think they will you know and what what what uh what is going to hurt a waiting period so and you know for an FBI checkup to see if your not a mass murderer or something
i don't think that's going to hurt anything
no but
but i i i agree with you um
[noise] because i live uh just north of Dallas
and thi- this place in in Dallas is a mess we we moved out of Dallas last year
uh my husband was transferred up here north of
north of Dallas and to uh McKinney's a much smaller town and it's about oh forty five minutes north
and uh Dallas is a mess i mean it just it's one of the w- m- top crime
i mean it may be no it was the number one crime
yes last year
yeah oh yeah it's it's it- it's bad a- and well in certain parts of town
bad [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah
oh
nice
oh my that that's frightening that
[laughter]
yeah yes
uh-huh
oh i-
yes lock the doors [laughter]
[laughter] i don't care if you have a flat and you c-
keep going
well when you get lo- there's a saying down here all roads lead to south Dallas when you get lost so [laughter]
[laughter] it seems like i- i- when you first get down here and you're trying to find your way around you end y- you seem to end up in the bad part of town no matter what direction your going [laughter]
[laughter] oh i- it- but it's uh w-
it seems like the sirens just going all the time and you just uh people in the y- you'd every once in a while you'd hear what you
was that a gun was that a gun
[laughter] i need one hum i hope not but it sure did sound like it
uh-huh
oh
[laughter] oh gosh
oh ooh
yeah i we don't we don't own any guns but uh you know the temptation has been there you know
to to go out an- and and and get something for for protection because as much many break-ins and stuff as
as there are i mean and and and they just don't stop with breaking in i mean usually they'll kill you you know for for twenty dollars in your pocket
so it's it's a it's it's a frightening situation
um-hum
uh-huh
oh yeah
of course
uh-huh oh yeah
no
oh yeah
ouch well yeah and a situation like that you know your your reflexes aren't good your senses aren't good i'd be
you j- y- y- you just don't know what you'd do
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
oh my
that's true uh yeah
yeah
yeah being cl- close as close as to it to a a situation as he is
i can i can see why he would and you know everybody ought to know how to how to sh- how to shoot a gun a- and you know just you know just in case i never have
but um my my hu- uh husband's family has always had guns g- uh hunting guns and plus antique plus antique weapons his his family uh uh
collect some of antique ones he can l- he can shoot a muzzle loader real good but uh tha- that but um
um but i have a two year old and one on the way and uh that's that bo- it bothers it would make me really nervous to have a gun in the house no matter
where i- e- even if it was locked up it would really make me nervous
oh [laughter]
yeah
oh yes i would too
um-hum
yeah
i know i ha- i had a college professor that went i went to school in in Missouri that's where we're from and he went to DC on a conf- for a a big conference he's a political science uh
professor and he got kidnapped outside of a deli and was taken to taken to one to a a lovely part of town and stabbed and left for dead
but uh he he recovered and you know i mean in am- amazing amounts of time and he was stabbed and was back before the s- the the semester was over and he was
that
yeah well they robbed hi- it it was they um robbed him it was it was a robbery
they just wanted his money because they could probably you know he was a college professor he looked you know like he had money and
oh i- i mean they they really didn't work- worked on him bad and it it just it was
horrible [laughter]
yes
yeah
oh y- oh yes w- and it's always children that it happens seems like
uh
[laughter]
yes [laughter]
[laughter]
then what uh
well what's their explanation then that
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yes
yes it is very lucky
it is because um
you can't you you need you
[noise]
what kind of fishing do you enjoy
so you like fresh water
uh-huh
oh i see
well i was raised on the Texas Gulf Coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast
and so i thought fish came out of the ocean
and anything that was fresh water was muddy
so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties
so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
there's so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can
go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun
so i- i grew up fishing
what area lakes do you like
oh i see
oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh
Lake Caddo or something like that
if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything
i would love to do that but they have snakes over there
and i'm not too
welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake
i just i- i i don't see it
i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements
and i've heard so many stories about the snakes
you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just
i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught
on a lake yeah on a la- on a lake that's not a bad size fish
i- i would be impressed i mean you know
i've never done that
i've i've seen it
uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh
it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there
it's not a treat
it's what you do every day you know
uh one of my favorite things
was we were forever catching crab and steaming them
you know out on the on the beach
and you know just uh pitching them out on uh
on uh
what am i trying to say newspaper
and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it
and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left
so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do
no
no no i live in Dallas
i lived in Dallas
we had a house in Port Aransas
it's a little fishing village that is
corpus
well
uh South Padre is on down the bend
it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region
small island
uh
oh okay
was it bad
oh i hate to hear that
huh-uh
no no no
you went to Galveston uh
i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water
the uh what is it the Flagship
is it still there
i like that place
[noise]
i didn't realize that had happened for some reason
[noise]
well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it
huh-uh swimming is for swimming
pool that's why they call them swimming pools
that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean
no
i've seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that
but really huge sharks are down there i mean
incredibly large sharks
uh some of the young
dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night
it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the [vocalized-noise]
and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the [vocalized-noise] uh just
kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with
well it certainly was um [noise]
maybe you can get [noise] how many have you had very many of these calls
how wonderful
how wonderful
maybe i'll be so lucky
okay i enjoyed talking to you
bye-bye
[noise]
well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat
and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming
because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing
uh-huh uh-huh i've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing
because you get i get sea sick [laughter] but one of these days i'm go- hoping they'll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice
have you
uh
um-hum
oh my goodness
uh-huh
wow
um-hum um-hum
oh i bet it is
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
well uh now i haven't done much fishing here in Texas uh because i moved from Ohio
uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east
in East Texas and do fishing and i can't remember what the name of the lake is
and he was just here this past weekend i could have i- i think he mentioned it again but i couldn't remember what it was
um i want to call it Salt Fork or
Lake Fork i i can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
i you know that may be it that may be it and it
yeah
yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the United States
in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen
so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh
and catch some bass
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
[laughter] that's true
uh-huh
yeah oh
yeah
um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds
and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big
um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me
yeah
no that's a good size fish [laughter]
yeah yeah so uh but yeah i'd love to go ca- catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
that's right that's right
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
right right well do you live like along uh Houston
down there
well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston
oh okay but you uh
oh okay okay
that's close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay
okay okay
um-hum um-hum
yeah yeah i i've been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child
yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further
yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was
oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think uh and yeah and that that's true um
uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there
[vocalized-noise] huh-uh no i wouldn't want to eat them you know so yeah
um-hum
yes uh-huh
it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal
that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was
yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool
because the water was so awful and
yeah yeah
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
no no not anymore
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
wow
uh-huh
wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh
yeah yeah right well it was nice talking to you
[vocalized-noise]
um yeah almost everyday
yeah almost almost every single day from when they started it
yeah
[laughter]
okay [laughter] bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of
of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent
go up to uh state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh
uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh [vocalized-noise] they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little ho- air conditioning room at night
so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms
and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones [laughter] with more entertainment than uh survival in mind
uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and
rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids
[noise] and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then
worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at
and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and
at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the
[vocalized-noise] uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior
so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the
camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water
well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only
surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and
loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas it's got some real nice uh
canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much
um-hum
[laughter] that's true
hum
um-hum
yeah
i wonder if uh being from uh
Dallas area i- i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i- i seems like back packing goes well with
mountain and sce- sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so
uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a co- considerable amount of woods or if you go
uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a
a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh
but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't
all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping
that's not too bad
that's not too bad at all
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
huh
yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was
oh the campsites were uh
not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some
you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge
and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know your doing it by the head lights of the cars and
and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said
huh yeah yeah do- doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and
and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh
then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and
woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the
the radio and they clocked a ninety seven mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge uh
lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and
and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just uh
the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out
[laughter]
yeah yeah
yeah that's for sure
yep
that's true
on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh
real uh carved out the the the
sh- shoreline is
uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth
and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach
and that was uh a that particular campout
um-hum
[laughter]
right
um-hum
huh
um-hum
um-hum
huh
huh
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] i mostly do uh back packing
uh as opposed to any of the other sorts
um
though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type
uh-huh the uh yeah i've
done things uh i guess mostly
upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail kinds of things uh i prefer going out either
with one other person or by myself for about a week
and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and
kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i actually got to scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but uh
still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and
enjoy the wildlife
um-hum
huh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights uh it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh
the fall and spring when the insects haven't come out yet uh where they're already gone uh
you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from
some place to go hiking where i am now
um
pardon me
no no it's not bad and uh yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's uh
you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which
isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to
you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh [laughter] but uh it can be a lot of fun
and uh i there's certainly other people who go out uh canoeing i mean there's usually lots and lots of ponds uh particularly [vocalized-noise]
uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas
and just get three days from any place that's civilization
and that's kind of fun
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
oh boy
huh
um-hum
yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm
telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've i've done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the uh
the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this it's it's remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tent's blowing down or when you wake up in the middle of the night and there's a hurricane and you know it's
we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then too much you know i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to think gee i survived that [laughter] we'll always need the uh feather bed as it were
um-hum
[noise]
okay i guess that's it uh
i was just thinking about what movies i've seen lately mostly uh [noise] we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the doll- used to call the dollar movies
uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh
found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
well that's
yeah
yeah
w- well i didn't even see Batman so that's uh that's pretty good so
or no let's see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so that's
yeah so
uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either
oh yeah
yeah so
so you watch a lot of videos
then uh
yeah that's right what uh what do you find uh that you're looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff
um-hum
yeah
yeah
uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a h- what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now
and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good they're not uh it's not so far you know from when they were first run that you don't enjoy them
occasionally you'll find one that's you know some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that you'd seen them [laughter] so you could talk about them sooner but uh
yeah that's
that's a little bit too much so
but
um-hum
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah but uh
yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are you'd think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time
and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend
and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or th- two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see
and uh so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see
but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn't get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn't get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out
we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh
you know it's uh it's one of these uh more i don't know melodramatic and and
i don't know uh not satirical wasn't funny at all but it was
i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know
yeah and uh right
but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh
The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i- i- i thought it was a real good movie um
i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so that's that made it made it more interesting to me
uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because
uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so
it was part of that was a little hard to understand
right and uh
so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i- i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book
but uh
[vocalized-noise]
um yeah
yeah we didn't see that one i'm not uh i don't see don't go see too many in well i would but my wife doesn't like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know
things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
right
well it's it's bad enough that you know if you got a little back problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around and usually come out with your back hurting anyway so
right
yeah that's right
well anyway uh i guess [vocalized-noise] if uh if you're don't have anything else to talk about i guess i we can hang up on this one
okay i appreciate it thanks uh-huh
[noise]
[noise]
yep
yeah
yeah yeah sure
um-hum [noise]
God i don't have to say kind of caught me off i'm more of a
[noise]
looks good in the paper commercials look great on TV um
[noise]
uh i did see Red October
[laughter]
uh this is going to be i've seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um [noise]
[noise] man oh man i have to say uh Chevy Chase uh Christmas you know the Vacation Christmas
thing was one here recently we saw at Christmas time um
God i haven't been in a movie since [laughter]
[noise]
maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah
it's been
i haven't seen any of that stuff really
well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um
yeah
stop by and get them at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them home but
comedies and the PG's and the no skin uh
we're uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video that's that's probably the last movie i went to see yeah that's probably the last one
quarter Promenade yeah
sure
i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with t- with a couple's a little ridiculous
yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red
okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um
[noise] but yeah we i used to really
you know i'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we haven't i haven't been to a movie in it's been four or five months
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
really
kind of drab
ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure
um-hum
is it a good movie
great
let's see
um-hum
probably overcompensated a little bit
um-hum
and well i think the now it's all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss
the last year i think
um-hum
yeah i'm not much of a Rotocop man Robocop you know myself
this one it wasn't heavy hi-sci you know hi-fi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all a sudden
you know when you actually met this thing and and that that was you know towards like the last third of the movie only really got strange but it was uh
you know it was cold in the theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn't have to think a lot and and uh
and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot
and it [vocalized-noise] and then you leave the movie like with your brain you got a headache [laughter] trying to follow this damn movie
yep
specially those intermission movies yep
and course those those do- dollar and quarter movies you might catch a spring too so
got to be careful
[laughter]
they're great
okay
thank you sir
bye
[noise]
-ay
yep
well i don't know about North Carolina but
well actually North Caroli- i think North Carolina's gonna to do pretty good i think they'll go to the finals
i know Arkansas was good i can't believe
i can't
yeah i can't believe they beat Arkansas i thought Arkansas would go all the way to the finals
yeah
i -n't know
[laughter] they beat Duke's [vocalized-noise] ass last year
[laughter] yeah
[laughter] think so really
yeah like the Hornets [laughter] anyone can beat the Hornets
yeah me too i like uh
oh the
um
Magic
AC Green's pretty good
um-hum
i'm not much of a NB- NBA fan
myself
oh no sure don't
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah didn't know that
huh
huh
well he made it [noise]
hm hm so how about what do you think who do you think's gonna win the final
yeah i watched the
yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game
pretty good
yeah
Duke'll be mighty mad though [laughter]
oh yeah well the disgrace they won't l- lose last year [laughter]
[laughter]
um yeah
with Kareem [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
been a while since they had the straight winner
huh
yeah like Jordan [laughter]
huh
okay
all right you too thanks bye
[noise]
all right there we go
so wh- what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke
i mean my gosh uh look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina i mean they they beat uh Arkansas
and they beat and they beat Ind- they beat Indiana they creamed Indiana
well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn't recover
well U- they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever
yeah big time i i'll bet they could hold their own in the NBA
seriously
i i bet there're some teams they could beat
ye- possibly
yeah actually i'm kind of a Lakers fan myself
oh yeah him and Worthy and uh
yeah yeah he's good coming off the bench now of course the oth- they got Sam Perkins
and that that helps
oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina don't you
see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan
the the three of those guys were [noise] the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman
yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point
with like sixteen seconds to go
the- they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it
yep
well i really don't think a- anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i don't know they're at such a high level of intensity
th- they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time
you might have an upset
[noise] yep yep they're absolutely relentless
[noise] well they're so close to an un- undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation
[noise] well i mean it's it's no disgrace to lose in the final four
well UNLV's kind of in a different league from everybody else it it's kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the in-
well with him yeah and with Bill Walton [noise]
and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational
because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there
yeah i- i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row
uh partly because the really outs- many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors
so you don't ye- yeah so you don't really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years
well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you
God bless and you have a good day now bye-bye
[noise]
okay
uh-huh
yeah probably not as much so
right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two
that's a big chunk out of someone's life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned [laughter]
but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really
benefit anybody you know
so
right
um-hum
right
or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things
well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as going overseas to do something but
if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now
uh you know it could be an advantage to them
um um-hum
yeah yeah
well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this
this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what's going on and and really enjoy it
hm
yeah
uh-huh i think a lot of our young people need to learn that [laughter]
oh older ones too i know a few of those
yeah
um-hum
yeah i don't understand that either that's that's tough
[laughter]
yeah
yeah well
another thing too is if you have uh some young people who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of
taking them away from that which they are centered on might
you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know it's hard to say
um-hum
yeah
oh yeah and she didn't get around to it very much [laughter]
um-hum
right
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
but i guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've
you know you've done something that's not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit [laughter] -o
better than just sitting in jail all day not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it
it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah
well i
yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye
[noise]
so regarding this proposal um
personally i guess my my initial feeling is that i- it would be a great experience for kids um i- i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community
through school through college i- i just don't think people have that opportunity anymore
i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that the- you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing um
i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum that's true
that's true i mean it might turn people more off than on if they're forced to do something that they don't want to do
i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable
but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or
or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there's a need for that
um-hum
um-hum that's true
um
um-hum
um-hum
i think it would be nice if they could
y- almost give it as course credit
you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh
people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program
and
besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment
you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it's dealing with another person
you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that
you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there
oh it's really it's true
yeah
well i- i work at a in a personnel agency and um i've just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting
i mean you know i'll someone might not show up for work and you'll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn't feel like going to work and so i lose my job i'll get another one
i- i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work [laughter] you know [laughter]
but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but
but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting
um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it
um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice
and things that um you know wha- the problem is that now it's seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don't know remember wasn't it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year
r- right or something like that and a lot of um y- felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service
and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment
it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did
i- i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive
um light towards it and have it look as something
you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean that's that's a feeling i get now and
i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way
um-hum
but bad enough right yeah that's true
yeah right yeah
really important yeah that's tr-
well this has been interesting
you too take care bye-bye
[noise]
hi Phil
pretty good how many children did you say you had
wow you have three children boys girls
i have uh three as well uh mine are uh uh twenty five twenty four and twenty one the numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember [laughter]
[laughter]
wow
so you don't get a chance to to spend much time with him then until when he comes home
wow [noise] i uh unfortunately didn't spend e- enough time with my children uh
where i- i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger uh i was attending school
and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job
[noise] children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed and the only time that i got to see them was on weekends and on weekends i had to do my homework so [laughter] it uh it
you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that
that i- i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder
it's it's unbelievable how fast you know yo- when when you get to the point where even your kid's age they don't want to spend time with you anymore and you know i
i can i can remember when my children used to beg me to go with you know even to take them to the store or take them someplace and and it just gradually goes away until you have to ask them do you want to come with me and then they start saying no so [laughter]
[laughter] well i- it's not sudden it's just that it probably doesn't hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head
uh because you [vocalized-noise] because even even my oldest uh child when he comes uh comes to the house he's still he's still my my my child and and i don't think of him as an adult yet and uh that that's one of his complaints
uh-huh
so you had a b- a bunch of kids in the car [laughter] that must have that must have that must have been fun [laughter]
well camping is one thing that i- i could never get used to uh i- i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went uh never went camping
yeah
yeah up in uh New England it's uh
uh you know three or four or five months tops after that you're in the house
[laughter] because it becomes so cold out here that uh and sometimes the weather gets to you so you don't want to go outside and drive around
[noise]
well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that
but i wouldn't sleep on the ground i went into a hotel [laughter] but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh
yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if i'd be in a supermarket and i'd see a cute little kid [vocalized-noise] i wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on the head
well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away [laughter] you know pulled the kid and i
and i turned around and i realized my daughter wasn't there anymore so all she saw was a an adult standing there patting her kid on the head so i- i [laughter] i didn't realize it until after uh you know after it all happened what what the uh th-
the sort of person [vocalized-noise] uh it was uh really something
uh-huh
you attend a lot of their games
uh-huh
did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons
uh-huh
yeah i- i uh i felt that my- myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn't spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because uh i'd want to do the things that i thought
that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing out- things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh
than with myself and i think uh she's closer to her mother today than than she is to me because of that
yeah it's unfortunate because yeah you know e- even though you you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it
yeah well she was close but yet whenever i wanted to do something it was always something [laughter] something different than what she wanted to do
um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out [noise] for the kids
and uh she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that
so i- i kind of missed that um i my daughter especially uh being with her
no she's the the second oldest she's uh twenty twenty three now
personality traits and things like that uh no i can't say that i have
uh-huh
yeah i think you force it on them [laughter] and and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled
the youngest one is more sensitive that's same with my family and it's it's strange
[laughter] well it just so happens that my youngest is uh extremely sensitive uh where my oldest one uh you know i can scream at him and yell at him and he'll look at me with with
but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel that
yeah
[laughter]
i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out and uh
uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we we came home and he uh
he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub so [laughter] she told him no he couldn't do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh
uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool [laughter] so after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it
and uh
you know we did it together and i- i come in the house and i wash my hands and i turn around and i did something and i saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and i went out there said what are you doing he said i wanted to show my friend the fish that i caught [laughter]
so he's so he's out there digging it up [laughter]
yeah well it was his first fish he didn't he didn't want to hide it he wanted everybody
how you doing
i have three i didn't say i- i have three of them yeah two uh i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys
yeah well you're doing a lot better than i can i can't rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen he's uh as i said in a senior in high school but i have a
uh my oldest son he's uh out seeing the world right now he's in Australia at the present time
well he's yeah he's been gone for about seven months now we're expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer hopefully [laughter]
ouch
yeah
um
yeah
right
i'll bet that story's all too common i uh
yeah they sure develop their own interests [laughter]
[laughter] it can be pretty sudden too
yeah maybe so uh [laughter]
yeah
i don't think i uh i would have to say i probably didn't get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either uh however i did you know uh
early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i uh
i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them
and uh you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we uh you know took trips went to see my folks in Florida and
and some of those kind of things
yeah we did we did quite a bit of that [laughter] just traveling and we had several Volkswagen buses there for a period of time in our later years then we did when we were camping and stuff and that made it a little easier or a station wagon
uh-huh
that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it's a lot easier to get out outside all year round uh well pretty near all year round out here
[laughter]
yeah
i guess uh
i can think of a uh
uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though
um-hum
[laughter] yeah
uh-huh
oh yeah
petting zoos and things
um-hum
[laughter]
oh yeah [laughter] oh oh [laughter]
our kids played uh
ball it wasn't it was like you know Little League and uh it was Dads Oaks Dads Club which was a like a Little League
yeah we used to go to the games and we had uh
i never did actually coach i'd go do some of the sideline stuff and like that but i never did actually coach but they tried to get me to do that i [laughter] but we'd go you know and watch them practice and
and uh pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing
uh i personally don't believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger
and then
you know she being a girl i guess she probably uh spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me
um-hum
oh yeah
uh
yeah
that's probably the same
case in our family too
yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and uh
yeah
yeah
is your daughter the uh oldest
oh middle child [noise]
you uh you have you ever heard much about that theory about the uh you know how their different their their position in the family relates to their uh char- you know some of their
mannerisms and personality yeah
yeah i believe it's true it's my experiences uh what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's children too it's uh
you know it's uh you know the older kid is uh is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing
[laughter] yeah it is a natural development i think it
yeah and uh
in our case he he's real sensitive and real uh thoughtful and uh
yes
i don't know if
yeah i don't know if that relates to that or not but [laughter]
[laughter] my oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be
yeah right that's
that's Matthew he's it's boy uh he was always he just
he'd keep it to himself a lot of times but he'd really kind of well up an-
be ready to cry or whatever [laughter]
he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but [laughter]
[laughter]
huh
uh
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah that was i'm sure it was a powerful experience for him it's something he'll remember
[noise]
um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just
right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it
it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted
well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i- i believe that that again just people are taxed
a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there
you know what do you feel about it
yes
um-hum
um
um-hum
um-hum
the twenty percent
and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions
i mean that you know that's the alternative
um-hum um-hum
i know
um-hum
um-hum
oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care
oh yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh you did
wow
um-hum
um-hum
i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits
i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up
but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i- i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage
but once you get into family coverage it's crazy
i- it's just crazy
yes
um-hum um-hum
right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you mean
yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our entire amount i don't know if that's good or bad
i don't know um
i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know
major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that
i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status
[noise] i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know
i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean
health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know espec- that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills
you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now
yeah
um-hum
um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there
i don't know but
um-hum
it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
well it was nice talking to you yeah maybe one day we'll all have health care [laughter]
it's what
oh i know like i said everyone's been in from Texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye
[noise]
um-hum
they have socialized socialized health care
[noise]
how do they pay for it how is it financed
oh
yeah
well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think me- you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year
you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and
it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there
and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so
yeah
or they can't yeah they just can't
yeah i've been in positions before where i've had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didn't have it
and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know
every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those
i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and sti- wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard
well yeah there's a lot of people that um you know don't work
you know and don't have it you know any other means they've and so they either do- again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it
you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income
you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark
where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just
you know i just did it it's very frustrating [laughter] a hot topic for me [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
oh at least at least
oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but
you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i
know people at the end of the year you know that have had that money checked out regularly and then it's like well let's see i guess i could go get a new of glasses [laughter] you know
you know get a big crown done you know things like that but
i know
yeah um do you think that that that the insurance and all they've got in Europe does it cover dental or is it just medical
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how how do the doctors
[laughter]
they do so they're getting paid
yeah
i yeah i don't know either
yeah
yeah
i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it
yeah
yeah right
i- i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take
i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed
have to be headed in that direction
nice talking to you too
first person from not from Texas that i've talked to
you're the first person not from Texas that i've talked to [laughter]
[laughter]
okay you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows
and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them's Quantum Leap
and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of
a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just
it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
he is [laughter]
yeah that's right i mean
well they they really have changed him though if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he's involved in that charity
and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show
that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff
and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but
which of course he needed [laughter]
um-hum
right right that's that's good point
so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though
okay
Deedee
yeah i agree
yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh
um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his l- you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them
and they say that uh that there was abso- that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh
yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners
yeah
a- uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter
would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations
you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know
so yeah i i i kind of agree with that
well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um
um-hum
yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting
uh show to where you never really knew
which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um
you know it's i- i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do
yeah
but it's it's always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married
that the show ends up w- you know dying
a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probab- well maybe it's not a good example i've been watching
Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night -til six or -til five o'clock the next morning
all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead
um-hum the same thing
yeah the i- i- it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and
and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh
uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um
couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon
she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who ev- always solved the things and and figured out and kept
Max from getting real messed up well tow- whenever they got married she got dingy
you know why would they do that
it it made no sense
yeah
unfortunately that's probably true
um-hum
well do you watch um
what is that show uh Who's the Boss
it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think
yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart
and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird
um-hum
hum right
well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet
yeah i mean
yeah
now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them but um
uh their marriage was so highly publicized
that there was no way that they could stay together
uh or at least that's the way i look at it
so i don't know
yeah i would think so
um-hum
yeah it's it wouldn't be easy
so hum
well that's kind of interesting
so um
well i gue- i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it
[laughter] yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it
well i think i've um you're the second female i've talked to
yeah it's it's kind of nice [laughter]
so
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
okay
okay
[laughter]
um-hum
[laughter]
it's funny that those are my two hu- my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like Night Court
and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but
i used to think um
Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me [laughter] and and i told my husband that's the whole point but [laughter] i i just it's
i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just
oh
um-hum
i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um
i think uh yeah i think so [laughter] which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets
um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that
um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old ser- series better when um
Deedee was in there yes
and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed
yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her
uh-huh
the second lady uh-huh yeah
they didn't yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that's what i didn't like
and
um-hum
right
and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance
yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just
i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it
yeah
um-hum
yeah
just go ahead and quit the wondering and and
yeah
uh-huh
oh
um-hum
yeah
i didn't
i was going to say i didn't ever watch Moonlighting but i heard that's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died
um-hum
right
halfway through
yeah
yeah
um-hum
oh
yeah
i i'm guess it's go- falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows
yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that
but
i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so
um-hum
um-hum
yeah it's funny how we uh
we we romanticize people uh like w- for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance uh
romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on TV
probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger i'm not into rock stars too much lately but [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
it would have been hard wouldn't it
i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so
having twenty million people watch you do that [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you
[laughter]
oh you're the first man i've talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change
you've had a little bit of variety huh [laughter] okay [laughter] well thanks so much bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
where do you get most of your current events
uh-huh
yeah yeah i was i was uh we don't have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control
we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on
it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldn't get enough of it
but uh
yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and [vocalized-noise] watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening
huh
yeah yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it d- you couldn't put it down
it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back [vocalized-noise]
and uh but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while
i try to um [noise] the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and uh i usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work
and at that point i tr- at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections
uh-huh
[noise] where do what what newspaper do you get uh there
how does it how does compare have you can you com- like how does it compare to the Post
yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial
is it really i mean
that's m- that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the Post uh
which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this w- we're really in an in an iso- different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean
but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news
i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal
be- because by ten thirty i start to fade
so uh
what are you studying
like yeah i remember when i was in school
yeah
yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis
uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep
that's exactly right and i'd
yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson
uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation
oh that's true yeah
yeah
that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories
uh-huh
yeah yeah
does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you're not getting more direct news or
what are you studying
okay yeah um i guess
yeah how old are you
okay then i'm see i'm about twenty years older
and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i- i guess i regret i don't get enough loc- really local we get some local papers but i guess i'm more interested in the national or international
over- news overload
yeah
but
well it's har- i'll i'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there're so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it
and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay
i hope so
take care bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh [noise] well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot
[noise] but um
[noise]
i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down
uh-huh
yeah
yeah C N N coverage was really good
yeah
yeah
it kind of get wrapped up in it
yeah
kind of like watching the Olympics
kind of like watching the Olympics
[noise]
yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news [vocalized-noise]
yeah
right right
do you uh normally read the newspaper every day
the what the Post
[noise]
[vocalized-noise] pretty good newspaper
uh-huh
yeah
i don't i don't regularly watch
news or uh
newspaper i- i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war going on oh okay
uh just the Raleigh local paper
oh it's it's it's not even a comparison
yeah
yeah the news is the same way the n- the local news here is kind of lousy
it's not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
that explains it
right
right
uh-huh
um
yeah
[laughter]
i'm in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don't and i d- i don't really don't have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldn't i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm
finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective
yeah
what's neat is seeing history happen you know
i guess that's it
yeah
um [vocalized-noise] in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service men from here you know and people really saw that
saw it first hand
[noise] yeah some of it got a little i- i don't know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life
little too much maybe
uh no not really
i'm in computer science
i see it as information age [laughter]
i'm twenty five
yeah
uh-huh
it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that
yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know it's a little near sighted but uh
yeah
yeah
okay did it work out your first time all right
okay alright bye-bye
have you had to put anyone in a nursing home
um
yeah twenty four hours
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh
n- nursing home wouldn't it
oh and the nurse at home isn't oh okay i got you
yeah i didn't know that
now well my brother in law was working with uh
in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do
you know uh you know cleaning up after me- uh men and women using the restroom and stuff he he he couldn't handle it
yeah
well seems to me if a person gets into that area
they i- i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it
uh
yeah and um
yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh
i've even heard of some people being sexually abused
yeah they steal from them
i did-
yeah
yeah
yeah
in each square
[laughter]
[laughter] all over
th- that's not right
i've i've only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father's side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh
yeah
yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and
yeah
what time you going to come in just come in [vocalized-noise] uh
ye- yeah
yeah
you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them
yeah well i've heard uh some things you know uh i- i don't know where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a
what you're saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it
yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little
yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes
um
bad news
we- i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard
yeah
well if it ain't uh well you know uh
well
yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them
true
yeah
or mine yeah i got you there
or you can force them to do it if you know
yeah uh
no it's not
yeah
yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more
well
yeah and the- and he'd have to pay it all
yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best
yeah
yeah
well i know my mom from a uh family of at least sixteen i've lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago
and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh
hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there's some of my family that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close
and uh then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off
and
you know well in California too i've got a friend that lives out there and uh she's got a little two three bedroom house with a gara- a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month
California is high
that's what we keep saying [laughter]
uh well that's
well that's a good initiative uh i guess if if but
no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home
and she was in there she got sick
and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse
t- you know a- all day nurse
yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts
you know that's sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one
you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then
well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see
and the nurses aren't no
see you have to pay that
and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i
you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them don't care some of them do care
the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them there
and to do the things that they need to do
uh-huh
oh yeah it's gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is
you know because they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not
walking you know
and it just depends on how bad that person is
yeah
you ought to do your job
and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people
well
they st- yeah that and they steal
uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there
you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs
and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here
because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it
and you know bed- her bedspread sh- i took her a bedspread because sh- a comforter because she was always cold
and so uh you know then [laughter] i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking like it's
it almost [laughter] you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed
huh-uh
yeah well see th- this one i- i is more or less first hand you know she just died um
we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know f-
seven years eight years
and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it
and that's another thing you know
but you don't ha- it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes
sometimes you don't
and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people
yeah
you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because they're not expecting you
you know they expect you Sa- like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week
hum-um
it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for
and it's really not some people don't need to be in there
that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home
yeah
don't
yeah
and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need
little place to live you know even just a little room
or whatever
sometimes yeah it depends on the patient
and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals
because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one
get my purse uh
but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um
bad news unless you can find a really good one
and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones
i mean [laughter]
i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day
and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that's the way i feel yeah
or maybe that won't not make it that far in life
for what they did to somebody but
that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh
there's two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a child and a so- person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right
them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying
you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody gro- uh say my age you know you know yeah
because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone
but they so old
yeah
you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know
and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile
you know huh-uh [laughter] and that ain't right neither
so
it it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California
before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones
but now my mom and them had to pay for that too
you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more
if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had
thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month
which was better [vocalized-noise] but see my husband's a only child
[laughter]
yeah
if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if if one of her brothers didn't send in their check
she would have to pay it
you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it [laughter] you know
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
just pretty
oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house
in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it
um-hum
yeah
and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life [laughter]
you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more
which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay
you know
and i guess
well
i kind of like them all i played for about eighteen years a- all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college but [laughter]
[laughter]
no not quite [laughter]
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but
anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets
[laughter]
oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either
yeah
[laughter]
oh okay
i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i
anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia
i'm from New Jersey originally
yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so
right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team [laughter] that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right
yeah yeah
yeah
hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right [laughter]
well his knees were bothering him yeah
yeah for having him out there
[laughter] sure
oh oh boy
yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the N- National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows
from uh Brooklyn
and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans [laughter]
no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter] really
okay okay well i'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn
[laughter]
so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best
facilities in the major leagues
i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great
yeah
the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they s- when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there
yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them to Florida but uh
they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's
that's something that we're looking forward to
oh y- case in point Toronto [laughter]
yeah have you seen a game up there
oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think
yeah
uh-huh
now i- is Rochester where where is Cornell University
Ithaca
okay
yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it
yeah okay
okay
uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night
yeah
yeah
yeah okay
yeah
those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games
yeah
um-hum um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
yeah we used to like watching my my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh o- on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the the Beaumont Golden Gators
who were a double A team for the Padres i think but uh they they were fun games to watch
someti- well there's definitely a lot more hitting [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
so as far as the major league teams i don't know i- the Rangers have been y- you know every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June [laughter]
but they they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah i mean they've been
they've been young for a while and they're alm- almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows
what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and
but it'll it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there
yeah well i i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas
no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there
[laughter]
that's probably because of the roads you just don't yeah we we've just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north
well it's so crowded up there
golly
yeah
um
well i don't know you're you're you're like a boat ride from h- how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto
yeah
you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what
yeah
yeah it's a it's a beautiful city
i really like it
um-hum
so and then and then you go back to New York after school
or New York City
oh really
well what what kind of weather are you having right now
oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already
we're it's
golly because of the ice
hum
golly
huh illegal
oh yeah
okay um so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams
oh i was going to say you played pro ball [vocalized-noise]
not quite huh
well that's pretty good
yes i'm actually a Met's fan i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a
die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater
yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason
i never fou- i never quite found a New York fan
i've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and
so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox
by default because i went to college also in Boston
oh
yeah so that that's sort of close enough
oh so you were pretty close
well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad Strawberry went away
you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know
um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are
who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um
just eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in [noise] in good standing whereas you know um [noise] i think
i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore
yeah i
right that was year they beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by
by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston
when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buck- to Buckner [vocalized-noise]
i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do
that's right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i
right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in
that's right so
so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time
so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans
oh
[laughter]
yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared [laughter]
after the uh
well that's good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess
[vocalized-noise] you don't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there um
yeah so i i wa- i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although i'm really not
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
well that that's actually i think that makes something because i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps
you know it's good to have um
yes it is kind of small
right
oh that's
oh that's great so
yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy [laughter]
and
yeah exactly
uh i haven't been to any Toronto games yet but um
of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um
a Rochester Red Wings game
uh Cornell is in Ithaca
uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us
so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of i- uh
yeah we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city
um but that
oh really i ne- i hadn't actually known that
well um
but we have our own um our our own triple A team here
the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in Rochester
oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun because they're
lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um
especially you know and i'll um i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really get into it i mean i
i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go far
yeah tho- those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes
yes it's true well
it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i g- i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team
yeah but um so what
[laughter]
uh
well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a Met analogy here
if you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of
well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty six team that that that they were um
i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up
[laughter]
right but that that's if i-
oh that must be nice
well see that isn't too bad [vocalized-noise] a couple hours
yeah well it'd take me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium
so so i don't know i don't
yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it's still it's um
it's it's almost four hundred hour- i mean i mean it it's almost four hundred you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred mi- four hundred hours right [laughter] four hundred miles
barring traffic so it's um it it's uh you know it's it's a heck of a drive we are substantially north of New York enough that uh we don't get to go play
too often
Toronto
oh Toronto's only about two hours yeah Toronto [vocalized-noise] i mean i i want to go see
um i can i've actually i've driven
but i've heard about the ferry as well haven't taken it yet though have you taken it
yeah um i i really love i i think that's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here i'm only up here for school
so i
uh no probably south maybe Texas actually
some place south and warm i don't i'm not a w- i'm not a big uh i'm not a big uh [vocalized-noise] cold fan
uh right now we're actually having uh
it's getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm
oh that's great
yeah well about that same time branches were falling off everywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks
okay it didn't make the na- na- na- national news too much which i find really weird
but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive
yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many uh
and so many things like that so they were
okay well personally i don't have any children i'm twenty two and i'm doing my Master's at NC State so uh uh children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now
so what what how do you spend the time with your children
oh
okay and they
yeah
what what are you doing
oh okay do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball
okay and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what
okay
oh okay
yeah i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in New York so
[laughter]
yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out
do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off
in the summer or like in the Easter time like around now
and where do you go
have have you been out of the country
oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i i lived in places like when i lived in Washington uh Washington DC i never went to the Washington Memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the Washington Memorial
right
right well it's it's a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth [vocalized-noise]
yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland
oh okay so but um now i don't know but um but let's see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean
that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically
it's uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well i'm from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone
and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something
that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family [laughter] family thing you know one of those hell family vacations
[noise]
yeah
yeah
well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and
and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very
hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old
and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like
i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like
you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know
and so that's uh that the sa- thing that you know its like when like like i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything
they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning
you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah but uh it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like
i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if
if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem
you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know
and that's uh that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better
yeah
yeah my my father was raising four ki- oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh
you know you're trying to support uh four kids and it's pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids
he goes yeah but then i wouldn't have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know [laughter] [noise]
yeah
[noise]
but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester
and uh you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home
you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books
but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like
i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know
oh oh excuse me
well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering
yeah and and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home
because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so
no no because if you go back there then you can never get out
like you don't have any money to to get out
so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i'll never leave the place you know
yeah i know and that's that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that
his life just went down the drain so
yeah i i've been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so
i'll do it
all right same here bye-bye
[noise]
oh uh-huh
well no they wouldn't would they no
well both of mine are boys they're eight and eleven
and we're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight
uh baseball has started
oh oh yes we start here at uh five
up until it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May so he's going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching
uh-huh
but yes we're into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here so there's always something
both if we're not doing sports we go somewhere
oh yeah yeah yeah
no usually in the summer time
different places every year we
no [laughter]
uh-huh
you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often
and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see
oh i bet it is too
uh-huh
oh now my husband and i we go different places but our child- but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close
oh yes yes yes
oh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
yeah
yes
oh yes but we try you know uh i try my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does because uh
my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them
uh-huh
things yes that is yes
uh-huh
best friends now yes
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum yeah
oh uh-huh yeah
yes
uh-huh yeah
yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and
you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying well i work full time too you know
yeah oh yeah
uh-huh
problem uh-huh
yeah
[vocalized-noise] yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew
time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then
yes
uh-huh yeah
that's right but you can't take this money with us though [laughter] that's how i keep looking at it
oh yes yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
oh yeah if you can- if you can yeah
yeah
what are you wanting to be
what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college
oh th- that's my husband's into uh computers
uh-huh
yeah
and you don't want to no no
oh
uh-huh
hum
then you'll never leave yeah oh
oh uh-huh
well maybe something will open up for you
uh-huh
well may- well i've enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye
[noise]
oh yeah
it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it don't know what it wants to you know
for this time of year
no
really bad yeah funny weather but bad because that means it either means one or two things it's going to be a bad summer [laughter] or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year
[laughter]
i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather
that's right
no see that's it was a mild winter that's why i keep saying oh no
[laughter] [vocalized-noise]
yeah i think it's going to be really hot this year
yeah
um-hum
if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes
see
well see i would prefer the cold
i'm from southern California
but see the heat out here [laughter] ain't nothing
no i don't want to get that cold now
[laughter]
i don't think no i don't want to go no where up north no where
huh-uh
i don't even want to go anywhere yeah that's about it
[laughter]
that's right it's too cold up there
and then last year that's when they really had that cold spell
you know it was like um
record breaking below temperatures and stuff in Alaska where your ga- your car was freezing while it was running
you know the g- oil or the gas would turn to slush huh-uh see i can't handle that
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
no something happens then what
yeah it's not that bad right now i just hope it don't get any worse
that's about it i'm just waiting because see it's tornado season
yes it is it's tornado season
um-hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don't know it but when it gets hot like this
and you know like they're predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast
there's your tornados that's right and so they're predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh-uh see that ain't right
[laughter]
but that's that's tornado season
wait a while it'll change
that's right that's about like it is too because yesterday was really nice
and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know
i don't know
the wea-
that's about it that's about all you can say about the weather
[laughter]
that's right
all righty thank you bye-bye
okay well uh i guess uh you're pretty aware that it's uh been uh a little warm for this time of year
it uh the humidity's a little higher
uh-huh you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad but uh but boy for the end of March this is uh this is funny
oh jeez
[laughter]
well that's a good way to look at it
well if if you do that then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it's anything but that
that's uh
but uh i- i guess uh the win- the winter wasn't that bad down here really
[vocalized-noise]
yeah look- looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer
well hopefully you know if it's humid now maybe it'll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or uh you know for the last couple of years it's rained an awful lot and maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat
and if uh if it rains a lot
but uh
oh yeah you're right yeah yeah i used to live in uh up north up in the uh upper midwest and uh
and we had had m- mosquito problems that's for sure
oh really
well you know it's it's that easy to say but boy when it's uh when it's forty below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's uh
it uh [laughter] that's just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather
does it go in any any where north of the Red River
that's uh i that's what i've heard people say is they'll never go north of the Red River again
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
yeah i- i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car
and uh that's not g- that's not good at all and uh
well i guess i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year
yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long
oh that's right that's right because
already already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon so
yeah
um-hum
um-hum get a northerner through here
that's right
no no
no it's uh
yeah and i gue- i guess that's shows what they say about Dallas if you don't like the weather just just wait a day yeah it'll change on you
um-hum
uh-huh
well anyway i guess that's about all i got to say about the uh the weather
okay
talk about it but can't do anything about it uh okay
all right bye-bye
[noise]
i kind of like mysteries like Agatha Christie and that kind of stuff
no i'd actually i plead my ig- my know- lack of knowledge i'm not familiar with him what is he is he an American novelist
uh-huh yeah i know they don't write anything like they used to the classics
and have you been reading him a long time or
that long [laughter] we won't talk about that [laughter]
yeah
i'm that's one of mine my husband's a little more inclined toward that but i'm not real uh interested in self-improvement books at all i think everything's too topical nowadays
yeah and i like a lot of things that are uh have to do with politics and uh history there was one a few years ago called the Public Palace about what goes on at the Pentagon
did you rea- are you do you interested in stuff like that or
oh okay
[laughter] then you probably know even more than i do [vocalized-noise]
and i don't know [vocalized-noise] have there been any good b- books published on that i know World War two my dad was a uh paratrooper in airborne one oh hundred and one um but i don't think they have done anything good on Viet Nam
uh-huh
and is it true i mean is it um
um-hum
um-hum
i- i kind of one of my interests is um i've i'm interested in law and uh i just got a book for Christmas called Law and Order it's the history of the justice system and tracks um the the history of uh crimes and of
things that have impacted just the the you know evolution of um how we punish people and why things are um judged the way they are
oh action adventure i probably
you're not talking your Danielle Steele female by any means but on the other hand um i won't uh i can't uh Sidney Sheldon's does come off the shelf [laughter] for light reading for
um-hum
um-hum i've heard again i'm not familiar with reading him but i've heard of him
a real positive
there's one a book i just got i got it as a gift and i just started it's a little bit heavy but it was kind of interesting it um was on the best seller list for a while there it's called The Closing of the American Mind a little bit heavy about political philosophy
that's kind of what's happ- it kind of does happen yeah uh i'm trying to think of any self-improvement books i've read
yeah that's exactly right it's kind of like all the talk shows i think i got to get
oh um no i didn't but i- i- i have it and i haven't read it
that's exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um
and
i went i mean into a Waldon's and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like but i haven't read it there is a good one out though that we've had for a few years that i've actually read more than once it's called The Kingdom of Sound
and it is re- really good about the um Saudis and just tracking their families and the Arabian culture
it's well written actually
and i think there're going to be more huh
[laughter]
that's too bad that's not the topic i know self-improvement i think is the only one i got something like that when i got i'd been out of school for quite a while i think um back when it was again real topical um
uh women my age about then were maybe having trouble with parents or mothers and a friend of mine bought me something called My Mother and Myself and i tried to read it and i went
this is i did the same thing i went this isn't anything [laughter]
uh yeah
yeah in fact i just started her a friend a friend of ours turned me on to that i always i always looked at spy novels and went eh [laughter]
military stuff just never really did anything to me unless it was history
the um China the red the [vocalized-noise] i think it was the right author you'll have to help me out here
Hunt for Red October the one i went to see the movie for
i was a little bit bored with it compared to some of the other stuff that i've heard he'd done
uh-huh
yes that one i've we actually have that one my husband's read that it that one seems like it might be a little more interesting
uh boy
uh-huh
that's what i- i was impressed with how much documenting he does
how much how much um he's so much like Michener he's not as bad in terms of going into so much depth but he he's i like the way he writes
and if it's not something that moves with me in the first two or three chapters something like that i just won't keep it you know
[laughter] that's
and his action anecdotes weren't very good at all he he had he jumps around he in that particular book i don't know how his other ones are but in that one he jumped around a little bit
in terms of subways and just [vocalized-noise] just the general transition i mean it i didn't you know i really [vocalized-noise] you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem
anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um
sad when you find out the you know i thought i would get more toward reading and i'm getting less
any of all years
um-hum
and what line does he write under what genre does he
oh
uh-huh
oh that might be kind of interesting is it
um-hum
and does he uh in terms of th- in terms of their practices and and their culture i mean does he does he document it or is it strictly
oh okay
does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it
uh-huh
and then you still get information too
and what's his name again
V- Van Lustbader okay
yeah [vocalized-noise]
Lustbader i'm going to write that one down yeah because
looking for something different yeah it's you know you walk into a store and you just like you said you're overwhelmed by how much there is and you just i don't know if you're like me you you you're mo- much more voracious in terms of how much reading you're doing obviously but i go in and i like
to me it's like being in a bakery but then i just don't find anything i like i pick up like eighteen things and then i'm not sure so i walk out
uh no that's more no that's not i do actually i like Asian cultures [vocalized-noise] that why i was that's funny that you mentioned that
um-hum
um-hum
i thought that was uh do you like Michener at all
he's good did you ever read he wrote Texas a few years ago
that was good and Poland yeah and i've done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the
Trail of the Spanish Bit okay
yeah
um-hum
oh my
um-hum
[noise]
oh Agatha Christie how about John D Mc- uh John D McDonald you ever read him
oh yeah he's ve- he uh of course he he's dead now seems like most of the good ones are
but uh he he was he does quite involved mysteries John D McDonald
oh yes
since we- way back in high school
oh yeah
yeah that's [vocalized-noise] matter fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading
yep for when i read i read for enjoyment or escapism and i
oh yeah
well i ha- i ha- i have been in the military so i'm well aware of the Public Palace yeah
yeah i- it was quite it was quite amusing i used to i was in Viet Nam for a couple of years plus extension
and uh
um-hum
they've got several out uh
there's one called Embassy House by uh Profit that's quite good i was involved with the Phoenix program and stuff of that that nature
it's fairly facts whoever he talked to knew what uh the had had been in the program uh it [vocalized-noise] that it was probably factual he's kind of overdone a lot of it but um but you have to do that to make the books
um
um i hadn't heard that one i hadn't uh
got too heavy into law and order deal most of mine i'm afraid i go either mysteries or uh
action adventure stuff
[laughter]
he's uh i read those uh actually i think my favorite author really right now is uh William Johnstone
he writes the uh [vocalized-noise] action series
he's got about twelve out now and it starts out with uh you know after the big war and everything's blown up and he the- he's kind of
[vocalized-noise]
yeah it's kind of it follows his his travels throughout the world
oh yeah
um-hum
those i those i can read for a while but i got to stop and go you know walk around something
i've tried to do some of those but a- a- a- after after i read them a while i thought maybe i don't need improvement that bad after all
they kind of drag on did you read that one uh let's see uh
that the Arab guy wrote that the Abdul is going to come uh
yeah we got at TI to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the time they were doing it
oh yeah okay
i've read that i i got uh i got the interested in when Saddam Hussein came to power i got interested in him and started reading some of his some of the books on him the man's
oh yes the man's just probably totally insane
[laughter]
yeah
have you read Tom Clancy
which one did you get
Hunt Hunt for Red October
yeah yeah that was good uh he's got [vocalized-noise]
he's uh that's one of the better ones uh i've got i think my favorite that he's done is is A Clear and Present Danger
it's pretty factual he's got one out i'm trying to remember what it's called it has to do with with airplanes
and i started in reading it a fr- a friend of mine whose a pilot gave it to me he said uh he said it's a wonderful book you'll love it i started reading it and he went of course he goes into such great detail
you know and i
and it lost me
i can't uh i can't stay with it too long either but that [vocalized-noise] that i- i read about fifty pages and then i just said i can't take it
i just i can't keep all these butt- you know knobs and dials and gauges that are supposed to mean anything i don't want to i can't understand them
um-hum
yeah oh yeah it's there was just too much detail there for the for the neophyte
yeah it's well there's so many authors out now though of course i've got several favorites that i collect uh Eric Van Lust- Lustbader
he's got several out that i like
and uh matter fact
he's got uh he's kind of um
mystic oriental
he has one called The Ninja
and then then Michael The Sirens uh Black Heart
then there's uh yeah i think uh i think you'll enjoy him
uh The Ninja is of course The Ninja and the Michael are you know one and two of the volumes and then he went off and wrote uh The Gem Zero and The French Kiss and several others and The White Ninja has just hit paperback i understand
oh yeah oh no he no he's uh he's heavy into Japanese culture
he's heavy into Japanese culture uh along with uh the Ninja the arts of Ninja and uh all all the various uh martial arts
it's uh it fluctuates you kind of get uh fl- you get some flashbacks but you can really tell it's a flashback because the print goes to italic
and then you get information too and it's kind of in a flashback and it it's told uh more or less third person singular
Eric Van Lustbader
yeah spelled as you would expect
it it's you know Van and then Lustbader B A D E R
he's he's very interesting i th- i think you'll enjoy him
yeah
do you like do you like kind of like the historical western or something of that nature
uh you'll then you'll like O'Leary he's he's he's quite good at it i've got into one that i didn't think i would it's a i'm not it's a kind of a historical Indian novel thing by Donald Colesmith
called The Trail of the Spanish Bit and it's called The Spanish Bit Saga
yeah
yeah i read that one uh-huh
you might try Colesmith try and find his uh Spanish Bit Saga it's called the it's called The Trail of the Spanish Bit is the first yeah by by Donald Colesmith he's a he's a
professor of of English in Emporia Kansas and uh he he's been a doctor and a gunsmith and
all kinds of stuff and uh he he writes it it's it's history from the Indians point of view starting back when they first got the horse when they first captured the Spaniards
and it just kind of follows forward and i got i got hooked on it and there's like about sixteen or eighteen
[noise]
do you believe in uh capital punishment
uh-huh [laughter]
yeah
yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i don't know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe
about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole
and in a case like that uh where well you've got [laughter] a moral problem and an economic one uh
when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole ah what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess
so i just
early twen- well i could be yeah
um i don't know i didn't hear that much about it uh just the uh the verdict that they had
um i don- i don't really know about that uh uh
if well uh i thi- i think it's it's only uh it only applies to ce- a very few types of crimes uh murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well
i'm not sure what ho- what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty
uh i think it depends on what what it was they did and if the evidence was uh uh if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that crime
and if they were uh if if [laughter] if i had no doubt that uh they would be a a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that
well [laughter] i guess you've got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where they're not a threat to
to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them out of everybody's misery uh i don't know it's it's a real moral dilemma
i mean i come from the Catholic church and [laughter] they they uh are definitely opposed
to that type of
um-hum
right yeah
when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years
all of the sudden here they're they're uh committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it
no i never did
uh-huh
okay
right
well some people just are incorrigible and there's no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules
so in in a case like that uh given what crime they're guilty of uh yeah i could uh i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with uh living in normal society
um yeah i believe so
well people who tend to be say on death row th- i think they're kept in isolation all the time
i don't believe that they're given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community
right well [laughter] it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if there's no doubt no i never have
i know several people at work who've been called on juries and they absolutely hate it
well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're p- doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh they're playing with people's lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh
uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sen- sentence
uh yeah i'm in that area uh-huh
uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism
my gosh
yeah
right
sure
yeah yeah i'd
i don't have much sympathy for people that are uh
uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter
uh it's it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help
uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car uh if it's first degree murder or uh
right no something like that is just uh unforgivable
yeah well [laughter] i don't know
right
yeah
i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners uh the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they don't get a lot of respect and they they probably tend not to even survive in that uh type of environment
because even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that
sure
w-
yeah they don't have any really useful job skills uh lots of places no
um-hum
well [laughter]
right you've got life without parole something like that
sure well case like Charles Manson he's uh he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess
and uh people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again and claim that he's not fit for society but we're that close to letting people like that out of prison
[noise]
[noise] you know
y- you're talking to probably one of th- the si- the late sixties and early seventies original hippies [laughter] now living in suburbia raising kids um
[noise] i don't know i have a i have a real gut response that says nobody's got a you know a right to take anybody else's life on the other hand i have seen an awful lot of i've lived in major cities and i have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should just be shot
yes
yeah
something like twenty two or twenty three i remember reading that and being horrified
uh had she had any previous criminal history now that's the of thing i'd have to kind of look at
in Texas if you're going to sentence somebody to uh to death what is is there a specific criteria that they have to meet
um if you were on a jury would would you be able to to give somebody a death sentence
um-hum
how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of [vocalized-noise] what do they call it uh criminal [vocalized-noise]
as long as your armed over the history of a violent crime
yeah
yeah see i come from a Catholic church background too
and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting
and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that that life is something that you have no right t- to take
i don't know you [vocalized-noise]
there was a oh what was his Gary Gilmore
did you ever read the book that Norman Mailer wrote The Executioners Song
Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Pro- outside of Provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed
when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with Gary Gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn
given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know f- f- as a small child he's basically was amoral
and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this
see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put you know even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor
could they do road work and those kind of things and now [vocalized-noise] then you get somebody like Charles Manson who just even hasn't a guy around
and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously
have you ever sat on a jury
either have i and i'm one of these people who votes regularly and i'm always registered wherever i've lived and i have never been called
part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it
yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but Dallas is i'm is are you calling from Dallas
okay have you have you ever been a victim of a crime
you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen
yeah some of them i had for two days and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then an-
what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids
over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there and then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way
yeah yeah i you know i really don't know wh- what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors
boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell who's been uh you know abducting the the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate
and then you ge- you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters
where even a psychiatrist says
you're probably not going to change them they're always going to be you know at risk in society and and and i think you know having kids has probably really
changed you know my thinking on this i don't know i really don't know
yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is s- so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed
they don't even have social skills
oh i don't know i really don't know i- i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i cou- could hand down a death sentence
uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it
and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family
or parole in in uh fifteen twenty years
[noise]
so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you or do you like to do it
yeah
yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn
well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got
some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them this is my first year in a in a house where i
thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff
oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road
my house is on a main road [vocalized-noise] and it has nothing [laughter] i mean nothing [laughter] but uh what i do do is now i've always done it is at my father's house
we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total
um
this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do
that's a lot
[laughter]
yeah well it's my dad's and we've had it for ov- he's been there for a long time so
um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it [laughter] but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy
and we grow a lot of food
uh i enjoy it
um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them now that the
and we've tilled them so much but they're still
we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing
boy i wish this phone would stop screeching
yes
i'm trying i don't know if it's my phone
this is bad it's not getting any better
oh okay
i don't see [vocalized-noise] i don't think my phone really does that
but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times
yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so
yeah
yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic c- corn potatoes [vocalized-noise]
she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow ba- corn potatoes and uh
acorn squash are good winter keepers
i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes
i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i- i do a lot of the uh
a lot of the the ba- the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out
beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something
no it's just they don't like you to something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's
it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other
i mean [laughter] she she [vocalized-noise] reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but
they
yeah [laughter]
oh that's really weird
i will put i've put my uh
cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like
like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together
but i don't think the vines have they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees
oh
i know
some something weird
this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here
we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield [noise] was really bad because of the water
y- yeah
yeah i- i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in
with some topsoil
and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something
to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there [laughter] i- i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but
yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated
yeah but they put some kind of
chemicals in there too
yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not go- i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there
but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground
they don't [noise]
it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up
yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush
there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and
said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush
and he's cutting it down [laughter] so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding
yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast
some people uh would really like to have them and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over th- their lawn
so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them think they're great and people who do have them
cur- curse
another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do
if if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it so
they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead
yeah [laughter] because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a r- a rose bush
many times worse because of course it's a tree
yep my uh dad used to work on them so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one
[laughter] even
well if that's not the problem it
[noise]
yeah well i um
about a or just over a year ago i bought my
my own house so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know and
back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore
well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the fou- you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh
uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh
she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them uh
she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
geez that's a that's more than
that's more than than the property i have right here that you've got as a uh a garden that's amazing
right
oh geez
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line
yeah i can't even hear what you're
geez it's gone
well i- i don't know there was well whatever it was i- i c- there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um
yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well
guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work but um
yeah i mean that's a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in Vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really is because of like the cross pollination or
huh
what
huh my mom uh
put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers
near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the bees
and we ended up with these these like
things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers
and
and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant [laughter]
huh
no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it
um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something
yeah
uh-huh
oh well
yeah when i uh
my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet
backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh
i think it was seven
what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think that's how they measure dirt but
yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all
lots of fun [laughter]
uh-huh
sure
right
well it seems
i've [vocalized-noise] seen a lot of people use them you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would
do anything i mean
um-hum
well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber
oh that's right there's even there's bad chemicals in those too
alright [laughter]
right
well it's not that you can see it a little better and it stands out
[laughter]
oh geez
yeah
rub up against the siding uh
um-hum
right
right
uh-huh
yeah because it like i- i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like
[vocalized-noise] give you room to get under it sure
yeah
hm
oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have
[laughter]
then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it
[noise]
okay what
opinion do you have about what was what happened
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah see i feel like i don't know i feel like the
motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he's a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale i'm not Yale
and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the mot- the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order
and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too m- no i don't think most would i really don't and so i feel like the real motivation was something that
uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will
so that they will submit under the uh one world order [laughter] i mean that's what i felt so i'm like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think God's ultimately in charge and
you know i'm not afraid of what they've done i'm not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel he's lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but
you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there's a motive that hasn't been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh that's where that's why i really don't have a real
set opinion because i don't know everything i don't mu- you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh he at least he did mention it
you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order
so i don't know what do you think of that
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil because
i think i i feel like the r- the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not
to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i- i- i mean they're gonna be
they're gonna put us under if we don't become part of the new world order next year the United States if we don't
i mean we're going to be in big trouble because when Europe u- unites that's why TI's building plants in Italy because they're going to have power like we can't imagine
and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing
and it looks real good but in the end
i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person
in power that's not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don't see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just don't see that um
that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know
get more power over that Arab
lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean
i mean that's all he talks about but anyway there's a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy
well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i've heard him interviewed some so i think it's kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don't know about yet because i haven't heard him in a while but
i don't know so that's kind of my thing on the war i'm kind of like nah [laughter] it's all power plays you know there's so much stuff going on we don't know about
you know i'm like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but
he doesn't e- [laughter]
i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack [laughter] well they would
oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like
i don't know just i mean i would pr- most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on
that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and [laughter] if i feel led to vote for a certain person i'm going to do it but i'm not going to get all up tight about all this
and stuff you know hum-um because i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like go- we were like [noise] all the time and i thought gee you know God's going to protect Israel i mean he starts
he starts nuking Israel man he's in big trouble i mean we'll just we'll hear about it you know what i mean [laughter] if anything major happens we're going to find out so let's chill out and just do what we need to do so
um-hum
i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old [laughter]
and so when we [laughter] you know we're on the way to home church and the bombing's just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party
and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of s- it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so [laughter]
so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel
that'll be a good story when she's thirty won't it
w- well anyway well i guess do you think we're finished
i think so too i don't know if we did what we were supposed to but [laughter] yeah we did they can do a lot of resear- we get along good too some of the callers you don't along with that good you know you have you know what i'm saying
isn't that funny i bet they're going to do a lot of research on that
i know
uh-huh
really he probably had those glasses on like you know those Annie Hall kind of glasses i don't know what you call it John Lennon glasses that's what they are the women i call Annie Hall glasses but
is i don't know if they're Annie Hall glasses or not i just i don't know i always think of Annie Hall when i see them but
really i know the female version of John Lennon's but
i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know
but any- yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to Dallas i'll call you you know and then others of them are like they just wanna go but then some of them have babies crying in the background too so
there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in Dallas
yeah i had a guy from Rhode Island that we talked about fishing so and uh oh i had s- i've had people in Massachusetts and Vermont they work at TI up there do you work at TI
see mine does too in Dallas and um yeah but no there's there's TI's up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and
and then he didn't have a wife and i felt bad but well i'm sorry and he goes we're divorced well i'm sorry it was real sad but he was pretty nice and stuff and then him and my husband started talking salary [laughter]
[laughter] how much do you make up in Rhode Island so i was just going wait a minute we're supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so but i guess i'll let you go i'm going to finish my dishes and
if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they'll have another thing and we'll get you again all right bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
well it's it's a real mixed um
feeling about it uh
it's really good that we did well and that uh
we we went in and did what we set out to do i i have th- there's been like a lot of things said about if it was a political
w- if it was a war for oil or a a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things
um
i don't know i think the
the [vocalized-noise] the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don't seem to be as interested in in doing what's right
as we were when we started the whole thing
Yale yeah
right
right
right
right
right
i-
it's
it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that's for sure
it doesn't it's they have far too much influence over there and they're so unstable that it makes it hard for um
i-
it makes it hard for us to deal with them
i have that same problem at wor-
[laughter]
[laughter] our our plant is so unstable it makes it very difficult to [laughter] to plan ahead or or do anything that that's
productive
and
[vocalized-noise]
i can understand why he he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand it's too bad that he couldn't use this i- i- i know that oil's real important to our life style but it's too bad he couldn't use this as
a launch to say let's conserve more because he never said that
during the whole war he never put out like a c- a conservation effort for oil
um-hum
right
[laughter] right
right
right
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah it's
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
i know i agree
[laughter]
well you can't yeah
[laughter]
yeah
that's where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing
yeah e-
oh
[laughter]
[laughter]
right it will be
i guess so
[laughter]
yeah we talk-
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter] oh yeah w- yeah one one guy i talked to about about colleges he was very opinionated and
it was difficult
[laughter]
yeah real thick
yeah
yeah i think they're versions of that
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah yeah
right
yeah i'm in Dallas i didn't know that people from other parts of the country were doing this
no my husband does
yeah
[laughter]
oh no
[laughter]
okay all right thanks bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay well like i was saying Burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the TV's from you know in Washington and New York
so what i believe the people want the subject is is big city crime which is something
that i don't have any first hand experiences about but i have you know concerns and i have a few ideas of um
how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that
that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so
oh
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhood
so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up
oh my it sounds like um San Juan Puerto Rico we were there
just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over we were some we had
we were staying at the other end the island we drove into San Juan to catch our plane it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach I says well it's a big tourist town
you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk
and sound their sirens [vocalized-noise] pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach
well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young and what we have here in Burlington which
it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids
council that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up
kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs
after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one
like a big brother trying to keep the the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and
and she doesn't wor- you don't know you can be better than that you don't have to live on the you know the for a street life
but
yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale
they might have five hundred troubled youths when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into th- well the kids now they're so it's twelve years old and they're
selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but
if i had a child that that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy
and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it
yeah
well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old
and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from
you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room
it's ju- just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad
but i like your idea of education [laughter] if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools
yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them
you know like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true
it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city
just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a a Sixty Minute special
i know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not [laughter] i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it
but any big city has a bad section
yes they're very bold it seems
really even uh even in the worst crime areas in Burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night
i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything
but i don't think you would uh
someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal you- your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities
i mean that's you you're gonna have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling uh [noise] uh
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
right yeah well when uh we lived in San Antonio i grew up around San Antonio and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing
it's has kind of the split population um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large Hispanic population there
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that is uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening uh
um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the [vocalized-noise] the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent uh divisions through robberies rape
and uh car crime there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft
and San An- San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops and they take them apart and a lot of them go over the border especially like Mercedes
a lot of those those in the the Z uh the Z cars the Datsun cars end up over the border and uh
very much so very much so in fact um for a while there uh they had
downtown if you were to co- come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up
so now uh ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and uh once you've reached the
the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during th- during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um
you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have th- the river patrol cops it's very nice
but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um
there's a lot of parking garages there because um parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in San Antonio i don't know what the answer is uh
education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh
they ha- there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um
they again i don't know really what steps there are that they
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um
so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i don't know how you combat that i rea- i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know i- i do-
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or
you know unless [laughter] because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and
uh-huh
right i think so and uh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
yeah
uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night
[laughter]
uh-huh oh yeah but
um-hum
but there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the the crime is very prevalent
uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed
around here and um those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there
um migrant Hispanic farm workers uh people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey
so it's it's pretty quiet i've bee- you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh [noise] oh
well i didn't know that about Burlington i'll have to keep that in mind [laughter]
[noise]
anyway uh
uh
well i did uh and i'm currently uh consulting now so i'm with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are
pretty basic uh
medical um
i don't get any
profit sharing and stuff like that so
yeah
yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh
is they are now offering
you know flex flexible benefits
where you have more control and allocate uh like you can
uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can
can do other things and uh
they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits
so it sounds like they're going to get ver- more
flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives
yeah are you single
okay uh
but
no i i'm uh single i'm uh
never been married so
no i said i've never been married i- only i'm only twenty six so
[vocalized-noise]
i still got a few years [laughter]
and
so what are the most important benefits to you
uh-huh
the but the medical stuff itself uh
the health plan you're with it onl- it only covers fifty percent
ouch
that's the worst i've ever heard
it's usually the eight- basic eighty twenty
besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh
ha um
yeah co-payments type stuff
yeah
well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important
uh coverage uh
of the you know you may not even go in
to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously yo- you know to get covered is important
um
yeah
uh-huh how about any matching programs
you ever
you know what i mean where they con- con- contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K
is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent
okay
yeah
but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit
uh i don't get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i
didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave [laughter]
so
but uh
uh-huh
with an annuity
yeah
[laughter]
i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is
when i was in school still
i was down in Florida working and
uh dur- during the summer
some how i got a hold of
involved in a a marketing organization that marketed
uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could
and uh
the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annu- an annuity and uh
they would uh you know analyze it
the person's current policy and get a compu- computerized you know statement of
uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the the term life with annuity and the whole life
was you know there's fairly big dis- discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end
and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but
uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but
you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thou- or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to
yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh
and uh
so i think
yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount uh and you know that's fine but uh
uh you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know
uh
you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh
see i've i've kind of moved around from my home originally and [vocalized-noise] um my family's out in Florida now most of my family and i'm out here in Phoenix so
but uh anyway as far as benefits um
what else is im- important uh obviously i think uh
a profit sharing is is uh
is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term
um
yeah there's the smaller the the companies it's either
the smaller company
yo- yo- you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing
um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing
um
but um most you know most medium or small
probably don't
do that much profit sharing
and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so
yeah [laughter] they couldn't share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but
i wasn't qu- qualified for my first year something you know after
so
little over three years now
versus what
[noise]
do you work for a large corpo- corporation
uh-huh
i uh i work with a medium size company and we don't have profit sharing but [vocalized-noise] i would enjoy it since we uh it's a service based organization so
it would be nice but
that would be nice
well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no i've got a family two children
yeah
alright do you have children are you single
[noise]
[laughter]
you are i
oh you never have
oh yeah that's there's still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but um
we uh we've we just kind of started young in life [laughter] but uh uh we uh my husband's still with the same company for ten years and as a result
it has worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package
but um
it's uh it's nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess
oh the hospitalization um
is [vocalized-noise] the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible's reasonable
i think it's three fifty a year for the family
whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible's i think five hundred a year
and it costs a lot more i'm with a smaller company though
so
that's right
[laughter]
yeah it's not very good
yeah
yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month
and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co-payments that's what they are
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
well if we uh one of our children is just is just turned two and her first
eighteen months of life God well she had one operation she's been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she's she's just expensive the other one wasn't nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those
kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
no [noise] oh
yeah yeah my husband's got that available that's great
[noise] i think it's fifty percent up to four percent or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent
i'm not exactly sure
yeah that's great
[laughter]
yeah uh it it's nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is
money that you can touch but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CD's and gets life it's a it's a term life policy also
yeah yeah yeah that's what it is you know about insurance [laughter] i didn't know anything about insurance until i had got until i had children
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter
yeah right
right
but as far as being able to really leave anything
are your fam-
oh
[laughter]
i've never
yeah
i've
my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and
i'd really like it if my company did [laughter] they turn quite a profit at times but
it's not part of uh what's available so
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter] it didn't help any to share
yeah
yeah
so have you b- have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah
yeah
at uh
it uh quite a different world isn't it [laughter] versus be- life before real world life in coll-
okay did you vote in the last uh national election
oh that's good
i voted in the last national one yeah i'm not sure if i got the last local one
yeah and you're not sure where to go and vote and all that
right or you don't know what they sta- you know where they stand or anything like that
yeah i think you're right
yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices
for the candidates so they think well you know why vote
yeah really especially in Texas [laughter]
it really was yeah it was a mess
yeah [laughter]
did you think it's a serious problem that half the people don't vote or
yeah
yeah it also seems like maybe a- another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting
yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected [laughter] kind of scary when you think about that
oh gosh [laughter]
yeah
yeah people'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know you've got him [laughter]
yeah
right yeah
yeah i think so
right
yeah he sure did
yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or
something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so
yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again
right
yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i thi- i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every
you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote
but that
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and [laughter] what they stood for and why and everything but
right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair
oh yeah
yeah the press has a lot of power
yeah oh but boy you try get into that you'd really open a can of worms [laughter]
yeah seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit and i don't think they ever care to
well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting
to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye
[noise]
yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote
uh did you get to vote at the last one
oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be
right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents
right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting
[laughter] and it's it's they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote
right
right the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it [laughter] oh i know it [laughter] the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful
but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh
few years go
um
yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse
you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote
and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things
um-hum
right uh yeah we can get uh
you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull
yes
um-hum
yeah and uh who's the other guy LaRou- uh LaRouche La- uh
that uh is sort of the uh
socialist not socialist but co- uh uh he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe
yeah Lyndon LaRouche that's it
and uh so yeah
um-hum
right if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that
they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him
and uh you know i think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because because uh the guy did get elected correct that's what i thought
and uh
so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know they might do a good job
um-hum
oh yeah
what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism
and uh
i know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote
and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks uh the hours are good and it they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays
and so y- we've got plenty of time to go uh because uh down here in in Houston it's uh
the lines are long [laughter]
so uh but uh
uh-huh
well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line
and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day
um-hum yeah
um i've yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the
of the Republican party and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh
the not the ballots but uh
my mind has gone blank i've been wrestling with a child all evening uh [laughter] [vocalized-noise]
w- uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh
you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting
but
huh um-hum
uh right and uh there for a while that would that works we've uh
i i know i have uh [vocalized-noise] i'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy
but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party [laughter] if i know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad then i'll say well
i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um
but yeah you know that's not uh the best way but [laughter]
r- right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to
have the ti- find the time also to r- read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for
right or what you've heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections
i you know i'm i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day
they break it out it's ju- it's ju- ridiculous
um-hum it really could and uh
uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could
hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won [laughter]
yeah so uh
they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more
oh yes or they uh
you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that's you know all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things
no they don't
and
well i enjoyed talking to you
all right thank you bye-bye
[noise]
okay
yeah me too i know exactly what you mean
no it's really hard to do that i mean it's [laughter] i don't know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but it's kind of funny what we
what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make
uh do you not understand what i'm saying we we pay a percentage
um which is kind of strange [laughter] a lot of people don't do that but hey we find that it works you know
well okay um [laughter] like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand [laughter] okay i guess i didn't really explain that too well
oh [laughter] that one gets used up quick is that it [laughter]
[laughter]
that's [laughter]
oh wow that's really that is pretty detailed
[laughter]
well but you know that's good too because i've been in the situation in the past where i didn't know where my money was going and that
that's hard to you know you can't keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble [laughter] you know and
oh yeah
[laughter]
yeah
that's easy to do it's very easy to do and it's [vocalized-noise] i don't [vocalized-noise] it do you find it easier to i mean do
with a budget do you feel like you're you do i mean i know you said you have better control but
do you feel like you're really saving anything i mean [noise]
[noise]
oh [laughter] well that's
um-hum
yeah
which is easy to do
[laughter]
yeah
right well that's good [laughter] i know what you mean about the school because that's what i'm trying to do also and we're trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because right now i'm going to school part time
yeah [laughter] so you know trying to budget is again you know a- at this point we're trying to budget enough so we can
save more um you know so i can go to school full time
you know it's it's not easy to do but [laughter]
oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen because because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that
but
you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps
but
right
yeah it really makes a world of difference doesn't it
it really does i know i've been in like i said the same situation you know where i've
i've been in a situation where i didn't budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent money and it doesn't work [laughter] it doesn't it really doesn't uh makes a big difference
yes
oh definitely [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
right
yeah well that's that's a big that's really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids
you know and my oldest one is um alm- going on nine so you know it's not that many years you know [laughter] before she's going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because it's
it's important that they go to college when they get out of high school yeah
[laughter]
right
no that's true i mean
you hope you hope that they can but [laughter] you know you can't plan right yeah that's right right [laughter] that's that's the way you have to do it right no [laughter]
no that's that's an important thing to me and that's why it was very important for me because i didn't go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in
a um
college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through
they have to have a college fund so
right
[noise]
exactly
yeah
[noise]
right
yes i know exactly [laughter] i was the same way
very good yeah
uh-huh you're
that's that's that's strange because ours
all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them
and all their money has to go in their savings account
you know which maybe i'm being a little bit too harsh but but if they need something i buy it for them
you know i mean if it's an absolute need
you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if it's a need i just get it
well budgeting is a sore subject in this family
[laughter] we've actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um [vocalized-noise] i think it's good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh
uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we we never seem to be able to stick with it
no
[laughter]
now i'm sorry what is what is this again [laughter]
oh okay oh i see
oh sure
yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um
we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month
and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous
and uh misc-
that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we
figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer
um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we
you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um s- s-
so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we
go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it
but we have a real good sense of where it's going [laughter]
yeah
yeah
well
we're we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like
my wife's going back to school and i'm going to school
and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things
and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um
and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month
is that we're spending more than than we make [laughter] so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah
right
um
well no i- i- i think um i- i- i don't think we're saving anything i- i think what we're doing is we're we're we're making it possible to
to well and the fact what it is is it's making it possible to live beyond our means um [vocalized-noise] because
you know wh- if we didn't track it we'd we'd totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um
so you know we we do know that we can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to
uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says
this you know we can't do this right now because the money's just not there we we we're going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it [vocalized-noise] you know it's um
we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but
yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too
you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now
is meant to position ourselves so finan- uh the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so
we've that's that's the we're look we look it as as yeah we're living like this now but it's a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on
[laughter]
yeah
right
we're going we're going through the exact same thing
yeah
sure
and
no
i- i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh
um
but it's something to work for [laughter]
yeah yeah
sure
that's i think we're in probably in the same position
yeah
right
right yeah
yeah um and and and it also makes it possible
you i think before we did any kind of budgeting
w- we we were in we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything
you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now
we can at least say well we can fit this in
it's it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before
yeah
right
that's right that's right [laughter] it it it
yeah i we i think that uh
part of the uh the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that
that there were those years where we lived that way
and we're still paying for it
you know and so the only way to get out
from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting
um
yeah you don't want to
especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up
and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say well we're still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and
yeah
yeah
that's right that's right
i know
right well you know i we're we're we're trying to put money away for that too and uh um
um you know you just can't count on them being totally brilliant
though though they are but you can't count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um it's you know
it doesn't always work that way [laughter]
right
right or at least loans [laughter] that they pay off [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah yeah well
uh yeah
sure
right
well you know the the
i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them
because uh when i grew up i had no
no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for
for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um
so we we're trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of that's supposed to go to savings for instance
and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the pro- our process [vocalized-noise]
oh yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
sure
right
yeah
okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it
no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary
so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling
yeah [vocalized-noise] wh- when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them
oh my
wow i didn't i didn't realize you would think now up here
i- i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here i didn't think that
you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport
do you have to buy metal copper is a very uh good one to collect even aluminum yeah so
uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i don't recycle personally i i'm saying i want to do it
but i don't get a lot of magazines i don't get a i don't buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of car- a lot of different papers and cardboards
yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles we've had five cent uh deposits on our bottles for years
oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable it's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes
[laughter]
yeah
and recycle
uh uh yeah i see that
but it takes away employment from the resource that its using
i do too
uh they don't either [laughter]
yeah like i say it's not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it
it's just that we're so lazy i mean like personally i don't want to clean my i just have can cat food i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin
you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash
well i think i- i would be like when i bring my bottles back
um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over and bring them over
now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if
if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house
and i see it but i don't see so much that i can recycle like i say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper
um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i wou- i would have a recycling center
but now it's just me and my husband so i don't know
yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out
instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash
um no we don't but other other offices do they have a box for papers
yeah
oh
well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh frui- fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit it
th- they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much
you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most
probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have
a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange
yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda
so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can
yeah
is bott- is bottle return down there a heated debate
oh yeah [laughter]
well we w- w- well here you can't can't drink [laughter]
well
yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you [laughter] so that was strange but
i think if some people they have they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these
um [noise] uh the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it and [vocalized-noise] their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits
see how they handle it and see if it's a good way and then do it that way because as i like to say [vocalized-noise] people are making money on it the cans do are worth something
okay well is your does your city have mandatory re- uh recycling
um there there's some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up
that's been one of the arguments here i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it
um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers
well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it
that it requires an ex- it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it [vocalized-noise] turns out it wasn't worth it for the church to do
well
yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp
mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that
well do you do do you do recycling
oh
well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans
oh so it's worth taking them back well see we don't have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles
oh that's in- you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um
trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers
uh in fact there's uh there's a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such
has a uh a big uh paper mill that fact i almost went to work for them i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me but it's twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell and uh
so it's a question should i be diligent and um um
and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood
but it it it's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody's so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh
well but in general i think it's a good idea because there's like the glass uh you can't argue that the glass it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they don't
so we might as well recycle those
yeah
well that's what we've got ours we we started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious we took one load over there and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff and
you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there
yeah
but every little bit helps right
w-
well do you have separate trash cans at your desk
well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that aren't re- and it turns out it's not so bad i- i- i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic
or plas- like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard there's a few interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper
and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so
depending on how much uh you know and there's a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste
uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so
oh
yeah
that's an interesting distinction that
yeah
well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes yet that's the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and it's interesting what people get upset about uh
it it really is the the
well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck
and throw it out the at the and at uh
so
we- we're now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it it was it was actually legal [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
yeah
well you know the other
well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources
you know whether you know because when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas
so
are you a freshwater or
freshwater
um-hum
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater
huh
mostly deep sea fishing for
grouper and bottom fish
and uh
huh i have caught
one or two small sharks
and uh yes
put them back [laughter]
no no no i love shark steak
but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh
is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so
it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf
and um a certain period of time during the year they have
all along the gulf coast from i guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from
the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not
oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but
nothing i think i've been trout fishing once uh
i've never fly fished have you fly fished
[laughter]
well i've tried it once yes uh a friend of mine
no
i could never get the hang of it
uh-huh
i usually ended snagging
my
uh fishing partners or [laughter]
the trees along the bank
yes almost got an owl once [laughter] but uh
oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh
working in Florida i used to do a lot of um surf fishing
mostly for relaxation
you know there are
there are people who fish and then there are people who catch
well i'm a fisher [laughter]
that's right i i've never caught uh that much but uh
oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know uh
full day trip you know three or four other people and do
either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few
worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth
what about you you a
um-hum
[laughter]
oh yes
[laughter]
the last time i went uh
bass fishing uh i was with my daughter
a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter
we
i was the only one
who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish
i did not even i did not even i have been
i was out on a
party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing
everyone on the boat
was catching
snapper
snappers
except
guess who [laughter] i co- i
that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh
the uh the party boat captain could not understand
you know he even even he started baiting my hook [laughter] and holding holding the uh the fishing rod [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
right [laughter] and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a catcher but uh
i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh
they do of course you know here in um we're only just a you know few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland
and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh
go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh
or oy- for oysters
and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and
actually pick them off the bottom
that's right
um-hum
um-hum
hm
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in
some of the
inlets and the rivers around Rehoboth Delaware
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it
and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters
um-hum
and this is the ugliest
fish i have ever seen and i me- and they come in all si- you know i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long
up to uh i guess the la- largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible
no no
[laughter] they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them [laughter]
um-hum
well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in [vocalized-noise]
and i threw my line out
and [vocalized-noise] the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or
uh two feet long and scared me to death i [vocalized-noise] i had never seen anything and then i was fi- fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth
and then i
felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one
and i pulled
okay
mostly freshwater uh yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in Galveston with my parents and
i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater
oh really
oh neat
oh really
what'd you do with them
[laughter] you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do [laughter]
do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit
uh-huh
right
right
oh really
right
uh-huh
uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring [laughter]
did you
didn't like it
[laughter]
it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something
[laughter]
[laughter] catching tree bass right [laughter] did you [laughter] that would have been something [laughter]
so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish
uh-huh
right
right [laughter]
[laughter] you just like to sit down and watch it right [laughter]
really
right
right
that's nice
well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and
um most of it i haven't been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun [laughter] um but
um i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of uh Lake Worth it's a fairly new lake in Texas
and uh we went fishing there last Memorial Day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um
that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook [laughter] i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching
i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i wanna i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] really
[laughter]
[laughter]
everybody but you [laughter]
[laughter] it had to be you you couldn't catch one to save your life right
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them [laughter]
right
yeah
right
oh yeah
that would be fun
right [laughter] hand picked [laughter]
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus
and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area
and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab
so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything
and something i had a rock to weight it down
something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm i'm sure it's not a fish right
and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth
and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth
it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does
it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there
um-hum
i've never heard of that one
that's where it gets its name obviously huh [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
huh
can you eat them
ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but
oh that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death
it was u- it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died
oh
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established and i find the changes uh in the school system
i think a lot of them very positive
uh since his retirement the first of January in nineteen ninety i've gone back to subbing and of course subbing is a very different
endeavor than teaching uh
it's very difficult and i've after almost two years i've become a little bit disillusioned and i'm not real sure that
i'm going to go back to it because uh
of discipline uh although i've never had a problem with it i guess i've just gotten a little tired of fighting
i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional
and i think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago
uh-huh
uh-huh
in the community itself that spill over so to speak
uh-huh
um-hum
i find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the parents use the school as an excuse however
we're in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and it's a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in
Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us
uh but to me
the
the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning than they were they're more into the school system than they were twenty years ago and uh i find the Say No to Drugs campaign here
to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand
uh-huh
uh-huh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community
which makes a totally different situation
i've i've never felt that pouring more tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems or most of the school problems
uh-huh
uh-huh isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing uh of saving jobs or getting more salary uh
i do i do find that
the ma- the majority of teachers in our group are very professional but then of course we're a stable community and many of them have been in the system for twenty years which i just can't think you'd find that in a large city school
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
except we don't have another school
uh-huh
because they have fewer students
uh-huh
you don't find that parents are getting more involved in your area
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day
if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest and the student's out at three
i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh
they might need to be dealt with yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh And we did have we did recently have a a group here formed called Students for Academic Excellence
that was formed by concerned parents and they see that these these kids are getting honor jackets and they're getting certificates and they're getting uh more access to scholarships uh on a par
with the athletes which uh this was formed i think probably in the last three years and that's been a very positive thing for education itself because so often the emphasis is on
uh baseball basketball and football and it gets away from what the school is established for originally
uh
[laughter] well this is basketball in Indiana so
uh-huh We do all have our sport In fact we've been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school So sport is uh
has been really first and foremost here in the last month But we hope that education is first and foremost for the year
nice talking to you
uh-huh bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh
um-hum
yes
yeah what what do you said you think there're some improvements what do you think the improvements have been
um-hum
i think the problems that i see in the system uh are i- i tend to see more in uh
large inner city school districts
that uh
and i've i've noticed that uh suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems at least what i from what i hear than than than the inside the city school districts
and so i think the problem isn't so much the school system as in the things that go on around it
yeah
um-hum well my my personal opinion is that so many parents especially those parents who are in a lower income and have to
spend more of their energy on work
they say okay well i- i don't have to teach my kids anything the school's going to do it for me and i think the school can't
do that the school can only exist as something to help the parents out not something to take the parents' place
um that that can be yeah
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah um
that you know kind of goes along it it it's a small enough school where people can know each other and and they can work together to thwart off problems when when you've got a high school with you know three or four thousand students
um there's just no it's it's very difficult to keep track of them all
yeah
[vocalized-noise]
yeah the i- i find that i- i haven't seen any cases where that's been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it
and i just don't have a whole lot of confidence in that
i also you know i consider for example the the teachers the National Education Association you know they
i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union
because we n- you know we need to we need to uh instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh how well the job's getting done
um-hum
yes
yes
um-hum
uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility
i think the way i like to look at it you know a lot of people look at well whose job is it to teach the kids well it's the school's job i think whose job is it to teach the kids well primarily it's the parents job
because the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at school and the school is just there to help the parents
so i think the the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents and and we need to get to the idea well if the kids are
are doing poorly in school then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and and take some sort of action instead of
just complaining about what the school is doing or not doing and sometimes
if the parents don't like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school
yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems
yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh
properly taught and properly uh trained
some parents are but some parents don't have the opportunity to do that as easily you know people that are working two jobs or single parents uh that sort of thing
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and and maybe the children uh don't want you to rest [vocalized-noise]
yeah
and it's it's a difficult problem and it's one that
w- basically i think in in in large measure it's it's it's up to the parents to take the responsibility for what's happening
to their childrens education i think
um-hum
um-hum
yes and here here in Texas if you don't like football you're considered a heretic
yes [vocalized-noise] that was going to be my guess
um-hum
alright well thank you for the call
bye
[noise]
hi
uh-huh
well um i we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me
m- uh when my husband was looking for his job was um
hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all [laughter] so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that
would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance
for the fa- our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it
uh-huh
um-hum us too
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well that's nice
uh-huh that's good
um-hum
oh i know we just went through that ourselves
we just you know were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things
um-hum the
yes
yes it's pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having de- dental insurance too because um we- having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and
we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and
we have um you know we're at Aetna with uh an [vocalized-noise] we have like the
medi- the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i don't think it's the basic i think it's the other one
um-hum uh-huh
uh-huh no that's great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too
yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um
well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something
[noise] so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um
seventy five at uh six thirty five and so we- by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away and
e- especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting [laughter]
and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving
and um so that was something that was important to us and because l- like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know
made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement
i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be ha- having now but when
when could uh your salary increase and
is there was there somewhere to go [laughter]
um-hum
yes tha- that we can make our mortgage payments and
yeah that's really true
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he
felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for
for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i can't stand these people i but uh so that's something that was important to him and
thinking he could um work under tho-
oh just since l- last summer it's only been not even a year yet so
yes we're
oh yeah
you never know we're hoping that that won't be the case we
i think one of the m- one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um
my husband was raised in Irving
and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but
people would ha- we didn't have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um
we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that
so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way
um-hum
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh that's nice
yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and
um-hum
well that's definitely the way we feel
we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family [laughter] but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and
we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us
but anyway [laughter] well i my children just ran out the door so i need to go check on them but i've really enjoyed this c- conversation and and uh nice to have met you and you have a good day okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
hi Kay
i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job
[laughter] yeah [laughter]
uh-huh
sure
yeah i don't ever want to have to worry about that that's real important to me um you know we have that that Aetna
um that's what we the insurance that we have right now when we were in Colorado they had um a different type of HMO there that i really liked a lot
it was um not that kind of HMO's where you have to go to their they're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular
hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the HMO
and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions
and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time [laughter] that those prescriptions can be very expensive
oh i know especially if you get what is it Seclor i think that that just about breaks the bank right there
um-hum
do y-
do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one
right
the one that's like you get additional they'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and
for most things it tends to cover it we don't have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find
do- dentists that will accept [noise] pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times we've had to pay oh i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad
um-hum
no we don't like that either [laughter]
is his office in Plano
uh-huh uh-huh
oh that's not bad
right
oh yes you're not kidding
that's right
[laughter]
well tha- those are some of the things that are very important to us too um
we we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um
i think that's that's pretty nice but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but that's a that's a nice benefit to have
[noise]
right
yeah that that's one of the i think the hard things right now i mean they're going through some some tough times [laughter] to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job [laughter]
uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um [noise] guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times [noise]
smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that
just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company
but
um-hum
right [laughter]
how long has he been in his present position
uh-huh
well i was going to say [laughter] it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to ha- to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it
in a big company though you also get moved around a lot he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
right
yeah we're very
we're very far from our families and it's really hard fam- little children and um they were the only grandchildren
and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is a little off the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so
i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and [laughter] met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and [laughter] i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer [laughter]
yeah i mean i- it's hard i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us so um
it's nice
it's nice that you can have your family close like that
yeah sometimes it can be [laughter]
that's good
okay [laughter]
well i have too
okay you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
um-hum
uh i don't kn- there's a lot of air pollution
um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it
and with uh
i guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it
um i'm north of Pittsburgh so
yeah
yeah
um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but
the fine is nothing you know it's like nothing to them
yeah yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh my God [laughter]
uh-huh
uh yeah but
i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how c- what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait what you know i mean they fine the the industries but
you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do
um-hum
yeah i i yeah i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don't think it's something that people really think about either
you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because i- it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it
um-hum
um-hum
yeah exactly
well i really don't know
too much else about it
um-hum
yeah
yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have
i kn- i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff
so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah
um
um-hum
yeah okay well um-hum it's been nice talking to you ye- okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well um discussing air pollution today i guess
um
uh well [laughter] give me your first impressions
yeah
um-hum
uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what [laughter] real air pollution can be
but uh that stuff going on over there wha- what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in
o- okay
okay so it's i- it's amazing too you know y- with that with the oil wells burning over there that's that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess
but uh in Dallas we've got
we've just uh
brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and
you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um
you know there's uh
there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically water [laughter] type situation
um-hum
yeah it's it's yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah that's true that's true
yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never [laughter] i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um
there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh
there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then
five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about
it uh
it's it gets it's real depressing um
in the morning sometime uh just y- you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh y- you can be on the road and still not see it
and uh
you know i mean it's not uh i don't think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad
place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color
and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing
right
right i- it's
that there really isn't a whole lot i- it's one of those uh
[noise] it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and e- you know e- every little bit does help i i do believe that
um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self-regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually
it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess l- let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible
um-hum
right and it's one of those things i- i- it's so hard to measure uh wh- what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh
oh i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know i- it
it it could go on for years and years until they they s- start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done
um there's you know there's a lot of things like that i- it it you can uh
you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there [laughter] you were doing anything to it
but uh
yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it
and uh
oh sure
sure
oh there's no doubt about i don't know if you if you ever happened to see uh
some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years
and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted
that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know i- it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh
i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control
all righty
well you bet
bye
[noise]
okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment
yeah
well you've you've got a point there but um do you think one appeal is is too stringent
okay
now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty
[laughter] yeah well i kind of think we're too lenient number one
now i work in Massachusetts but i live in Rhode Island so the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with
treating the prisoners so-called brutally because uh the state prison's overcrowded we have to release them
so they took the offenders with the the minor crimes and they let them go they didn't have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible
um
i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient
but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person
they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're going to kill you
so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now
and the other thing is i'm not sure about Texas but like in Rhode Island if someone breaks into your home
you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with that person you can't shoot him you can't do anything with him i'm not sure what Texas is
yeah it's
yeah and ours
yeah and see in our case it's you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual that's what you should do
so
what choice have you got
you know as far as as far as
our laws go up here
yeah you're fad-
you're fading away Jim
huh
that doesn't make any
right
right
and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again
you know when he's straight so so-called
so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye
and i think probably uh
uh maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that uh that i talk to
you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody
you deserve to be killed also
right
right um you're subject to one appeal i- i kind of don't agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals
yeah
that's yeah right common sense has to has to set in some place it's just like uh [noise] uh organized crime now they know all these people they know that the the leaders of organized crime and all that sort of stuff why can't they do something about it
because they can't if they if they tape something they can't they can't bring it into the court as as evidence
and they know
they just had this uh i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but um the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony
and they got uh
uh somebody and i'm not sure who who it was what organi- what law enforcement agency
they got a movable bug a a a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where
and now they're contesting that movable bug because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there but they know outright
that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court
so that has to be looked at too um i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure
that's true that's true um self-preservation of the species i guess right
well the
you're kidding
because of because of what because of overcrowding or
huh
now the pendulum's going to swing
more and more people
yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your your newspapers just like it is in ours that
every major city now the increase of crime is is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now
i mean every day there's there's dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or
California they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you i'm kind of you still in the in the uh prison system
how do you like it
well
that's incredible
do you uh you carry a firearm in when you're in there
nothing
not even a uh uh billy club or
huh
what's the purpose of that so they can't take it
yeah well i don't know so you going to make a career out of it
[laughter]
oh okay is it uh was it uh civil service
uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence
go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence
if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it
plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up
no
i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal
absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation going on we're under federal supervision
and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole
second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day
third trip down this is where
my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states
third trip down if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story
uh Texas has got it rigged to where i can't sh- the guy can enter my property and i can't shoot him but once he's physically inside my house
uh the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room i feel real threatened so i'm going to come out with guns blazing
well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from
there there is no such thing as justice in this
country anymore we only have situation ethics
i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics
that that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period
that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts
but that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now they've appealed everything to where if they've got one typographical error where in their
in one line instead of spelling
they've got one word misspelled i mean it's a very minor clerical error they couldn't tell they they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal
uh-huh
since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators you'll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers
that's it what they don't realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of American pe- people are getting fed up with their BS and are deman- are going to demand real justice instead of this
in Te- in Texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence he's going to serve fifteen months and he's out
one month for one year actually assigned
overcrowding
overcrowding
we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right
yeah i've been with them for about four years now
all things considered i'd rather be a cop on the street because once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do
say an inmate swings at me or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him back to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force
thank uh federal judge named William Wayne Justice
no in inside the gate i do not carry any weapon at all
nothing
so they can't take it away from you
i seriously doubt it [laughter]
oh it it it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldn't turn it down
uh actually rea- really
all right well on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet
but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home so i've always been involved you know in one
well i've
yes well i can kind of see both sides you know i really can
um [noise] nursing homes to me i- i would personally be the last resort you know i rea- you know if i had to put someone in there
yeah if it's a have to thing yeah i yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know
that's like everything else though
uh-huh
[noise] yeah
yes but yeah
yeah
yeah i know because i've always well my sister's involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job
but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that
you know if you just can't take care of them any more
uh-huh that's it yeah
uh-huh
other things
yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i- i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at
not just
i do too
outside's awful deceiving sometimes
you know [laughter]
yeah yeah
ca- yeah yeah
off yeah
to oh
um-hum and everything you worked f- so hard for all your life yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
now there is some really nice ones there's also you know some private ones you know
but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know i mean that's way out of my reach
[laughter]
uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah
uh-huh the very same yeah yeah
yeah
but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know
like they could put it in one of their children's names or something
you know but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that you know it's their money
you know that's how i feel about it anyway
yes yeah
yeah my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know
yeah
i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know
uh-huh they're not lonely
oh yes uh-huh
yeah
no
around yeah
but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't
But no when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents
really do because i have been raised in one you know
so there's lot of things i know to look for
and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either [laughter] you know [laughter] i really don't it really would yes
yes and li- like i said my sister's still in it and i really [laughter] don't think my mother want to be there either [laughter]
oh
well it's been nice talking to you and i guess we'd better get back to work huh all right bye-bye
[noise]
uh-huh
how do you feel about them i mean since you've kind of been close to that
uh-huh
well i've had a touch of experience my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him
and uh she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died but
um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay
but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me
um-hum
[noise] i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about
but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable
yeah
well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family's tied up with
their own lives and things and usually working and
it's hard to
[noise] yes
um-hum i think that's important too in fact there's a
yes
there's one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um
walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um
they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time
but it's always uh well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off
but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever
yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment
so it's kind of a that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home
um-hum
yeah that's the problem the expense of it all is
and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately
but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care
you know
so i don't like that aspect
yeah
[noise]
this is
that's right
well yeah i've talked to my mother about that several times lately and i- i said well i want you to have control of your own business
but you know what if [laughter]
yeah yeah my mother's uh seventy five
and still has her own home and everything
yeah
that's true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things
you know lots of stuff going on and they'll take them places and
so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really
have some problems if you can't get around and do things
no
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
that might be kind of tough huh
[laughter]
well you too
okay [laughter] bye
[noise]
[noise]
um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles
and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you
uh very good
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he he's done the whole C and O canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts
and so uh but tha- that somehow takes organization for me it's much easier just the stationary bike you know it's at home i can i can do some of my reading
um
but
no i live in Maryland
right right and that's it um at work we have a a nice campus so i'm able to um
take advantage of of the environment here um
the neighborhood also i mean we're [vocalized-noise] within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do
now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it
um-hum right i think
pretty much you've summed up my my my motivations also
oh well that's great that's great
um-hum
right [noise] and actually in in summer i like to swim we don't have facilities for swimming in winter but um
and and that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool
i'm much much more awake i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening
so
no i'm not [laughter]
no
oh really
[vocalized-noise] [laughter] no i don't know that but i i must say that um
when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent
and it's probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and a- and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i've been abroad a lot so
[laughter] it's a mixture
in Santa Barbara
oh i see
um-hum
well very good an- i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you
oh okay bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
well do you exercise regularly Judy
um-hum
[noise] well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday
upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her [noise] i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike
oh gosh you can ride a bike [laughter] practically all the way to southern Virginia
or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that
[noise] um-hum
[noise]
right
do you live in the District
uh-huh
because i think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk
um-hum
well it's uh it's really both i'm certainly driven by
the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh
and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i don't but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't wanna is also worth something
and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll act- and i'll actually get energy
and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim
that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God i'm ready for bed
and you exercise and then it's sort of it's painful for a while but by the time you get done you're feeling really terrific
yeah yeah
so are can i just ask you are you Canadian
Philadelphia
i'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out
did you know that
hm
hm
i see
i know this isn't on our topic but where did you grow up in California
oh okay because i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that
yes [laughter]
well same here thanks for calling bye
[noise]
yes Jack have you had your car repaired lately
have you had your automobile repaired
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
was this a mechanical hitch
so you didn't have there was no welding involved
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah yeah i know i've got a a similar problem i used to work uh believe it or not repairing cars about uh twenty years ago
and uh didn't think of anything about doing my own repair work and uh i about twenty years ago i i got a real job
and [laughter] i've been doing it ever since and i've been away from it for so long now when i decided to do something to my car i couldn't uh my first experience was uh try to do something with the uh the exhaust system on my car
uh try to work out in the driveway it's kind of cool outside no lifts so you had to work with a car jacked up and up up on blocks
uh pulling the pipes apart not having the right equipment uh because i knew what right equipment i needed because i used to work in a garage i didn't have any pipe spreaders or chisels uh designed to do that
and it would take me two or three times longer than it normally would to to you know to get the professional to do it
so i started so i started taking my car to the garage and uh i had a little squeak
in fact it was about a year ago uh when i applied my foot on the brakes and i i been experiencing this squeak for quite a while
so i stopped at one of these speedy muffler places uh
so they have them look at my wheel bearing because my wheel bearing needed grease
and uh after waiting a half an hour to get on the lift i uh
i was there and he pulled the first wheel off the one that i said that was squeaking and uh he said the bearing looks good
so he pulled the other left front wheel off and he says uh i think i've got a problem and he says i said what's that he says your brakes are no good
so he s- says want me to pull the back off i says no and so he pulled them off anyway [laughter]
[laughter]
so then he says uh-huh you need you need brakes on the front you need brakes on the back
i said well jeez you know i only stopped here to get a wheel bearing put in and i says i didn't uh you know i didn't have uh
slightest idea i needed brakes so he says well
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh so i-
it was a continuous squeal
right what the
yeah this is evidently it's a new technology that uh that came about after i worked in my garage twenty years ago they didn't have such a thing but what what they've got now is like a little metal tab
that uh that that that is designed to squeak
when uh you know before the thing that they used to use was uh if once your let me see once the pad reached the level of the rivet head
then that was time to to change your brakes unfortunately you couldn't see it until you pulled the wheel off
so they they needed an audible method of defining when brakes were needed so they came up with that
but i didn't finish telling you my s- uh my story that was only the beginning
after he pulled all my four wheels off he says you're going to need new brakes so uh
i says well what is that going to cost so he said well let me figure it out so he says uh well probably a couple hundred dollars
so i says well i said that isn't too bad i said why don't you go ahead and do it so he i says but give me give me an esti- a written estimate so he went around and he says well your back drum is no good i can't turn it down because it's oversize
and you need new this and you need new that and he come up with a bill of seven hundred and forty eight dollars i've got a [laughter] i've got a Cadillac
[laughter] so
so i says no i says i don't want to do it i said put it back together he says i don't know if i can [laughter]
so i'm stuck over there i've got my car all apart and he's telling me he doesn't know if he can put it back together again i says well i came in here with a car with four wheels on i said i'm going to leave with four wheels
so he says well why do you want to put it all back together again if you know you need brakes because he showed me and i did in fact need brakes
and i was going to do it myself and i just you know it it i shuddered uh because everytime i try to work on my car l- lately i don't have all the right tools and it ends up taking my twice as long
so then he turned around and says i can give you a fifteen or ten percent discount if you do it now so i says okay so it ended up costing me almost six hundred almost seven hundred dollars
for that complete brake and i just stopped for a squeak
[laughter]
the the place that i've been going to because i own a Cadillac you can't go to a garage you have to go to a dealer
uh they charge thirty six to forty five dollars an hour and uh i had trouble with my fan on my blower
it my my high speed wouldn't would not work my low speed blower would work but my high speed wouldn't
so i says i'm not even going to i'm not even going to try it i said i'm going to take it right down there and tell the guy to put it in so i uh i went down i picked it up
picked up the car when it was all done and i says well how much is it
and the part came to i don't know twenty seven dollars and the labor came to s- something like fifteen dollars
which is unusual because i never get out of that place for for less than two hundred so i'm saying to myself if he only charged me fifteen dollars that meant that he only worked on it for about twenty minutes
and and i said just for the heck of it i want to open up the the hood to see what he worked on
honest to God the the blower a a two year old could have changed it it was right on top i didn't even bother looking because inside my car looks like uh
all tubes and wires and vacuums and hoses and and this blower is sitting right on top of everything and it was only two little screws holding it down
so it took him about five minutes and he charged me a half an hour's worth of labor to to put
no evidently they uh they gave me a half hour minimum is what they charged me
yes i am [laughter]
can you tell by the accent
[laughter]
garage [laughter]
i've uh i've had an opportunity to uh
to vis- visit Dallas and put some presentations down there and everytime i open my mouth
people [laughter]
people people want to hear me say the word car [laughter]
Attleboro Massachusetts
i'm in the uh TI f-
uh-huh i well i gathered that
for some reason the people down in Dallas don't know that they also have an a- an accent [laughter]
[laughter]
well you are but you do have a southern southern uh drawl i can i can tell that you're from uh the southern uh
uh-huh
oh so you've got a you you don't have a strong uh a strong accent the people that i were talking to the guy that i was talking to last night had uh a a stronger accent
uh-huh oh so that helped
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
i- it's not it's not very strong but it's there
so on on the uh on the car repairs uh have you ever had any other uh interesting things happen to you or do you do your own repair work at all or like i change my oil uh myself
o- only because i'm i'm too cheap to pay somebody uh twice the value of the oil and the filter do it
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
right right
hum well
why uh why do you feel as though you have to do that
to keep it clean
uh-huh
ha- have i what
[noise] excuse me
well i'm not much one for getting my hands dirty i never cared for that but i do uh well la- last weekend i was uh
attaching a tow hitch to the front of my little pickup
so i could uh tow it behind my motor home
and i'm telling you the air around Plano here turned blue before the day was through
oh it it was a very simple thing to do and i didn't start until three in the afternoon because i thought oh maybe an hour two hours at the most
eight thirty that night i'm
still working out there wi- under the flood lights
yes
yes
no no all nuts and bolts
but trying to get the holes to line up
i mean i had to loosen the front bumper
and i you would be amazed i mean you you think well there's just two bolts on each side that holds the bumper
uh-huh
no no such luck
no uh i don't go in like i say i don't i don't go in for uh any uh
deep repairs especially with today's automobiles that are computer controlled and everything
uh-huh
uh-oh
uh-huh
um-hum that's always the way
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
well you know i ran into the very same problem back last Christmas uh let's see where was i i was over in
Mississippi
and uh driving at that time i had this uh little Ford Escort
which tows like a little baby behind a a motor home
and i dearly loved it for that
but uh i was out driving around looking at the sights uh well this is Vicksburg uh so i was looking at the the Civil War battleground
and i developed this hellacious squealing just like you did only the
mine sounded like uh it was coming from the depth of hell somewhere that kind that kind of a squeal
where yes and it was more outstanding when i turned in one direction rather than the other
yes
yeah
well it it
oh
[noise]
[laughter]
oh
no wonder
uh-huh
oh boy
well i guess i was pretty lucky it only ended up costing me eigh- eighty five dollars but of course all i got was the front brakes
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
oh
uh-huh
oh for pete's sake
well i thought they had a a minimum charge of one hour
uh-huh
say are you from Boston by any chance
i'm afraid so the car in the the garage
uh-huh where where
where are you located at right now
oh oh well i'm down in i'm in Dallas
well i shouldn't have because i'm a damn Yankee myself
well
i've spent better than half my life in Tennessee North Carolina and Florida
Louisiana Mississippi
um well twenty five years ago i was in the radio business commercial radio
and well i was a DJ at the time and i i really worked on lo- losing my New York accent
and uh i like to think i managed to stay away from it but you're right i do catch myself every once in a while
talk along with that Southern accent every once in a while
okay so uh
oh oh yeah that i do and i've been
uh-huh
well i do it on my motor home because uh it's it means uh if if i take it somewhere to do it
i have to take it to an RV dealer
because local stations just aren't big enough to handle a motor home
and uh so i do the the i change the oil myself but something i have been putting off for too long now is flushing out the radiator
that i've got to do this weekend i've been promising and promising to do it
oh yes definitely i had uh oh a few years ago i had a
a Ford 150 pickup
and i didn't take very good care of it at all i i i must admit
uh red facedly i must admit that i didn't
take care of the basics
and i never did drain i didn't even drain the radiator every winter i'd check it
and uh well it was several years many years had gone
[noise]
okay you want to go first
yeah sure is
yeah it is
of course you you've you've had your fair share of that down your way too
no argument here yeah i- i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard
yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make
uh riskier
uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oi- when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that
without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down
well also in in- investments in oil ventures as well because it was predic- predicated on uh a certain price per barrel
to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to
twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even
yeah
yeah yeah
yep
didn't didn't they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar Band-Aid on the problem last week or something uh
President approved some more money to bail them out
well that's true
of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation
and uh at some point in time
it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off
i'm not sure which which one is which i- i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse
yeah now i i'm a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt
and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i don't know how many decades it didn't happen
and uh
i don't know what it- what it's going to take to turn that around
yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial
definitely
uh do we think enough is being done to address it i
i- i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were
right right
sure
that's true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf
maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth
sure
well hey it's been real good talking with you
oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that
oh
wh- what's the
yeah
what's the minimum is that like three minutes
oh okay
i- i think so too
you bet bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well uh topic being the banking crisis uh that's a real hot topic [laughter]
real real mess i guess you must say
oh yeah think uh
probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh
suffered and or caused the uh [laughter]
the major or a good portion of it
that makes two of us
[laughter]
yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the [noise]
the major culprit um with the oil crisis
right
yeah i guess that was the immediate cause
uh shoot i don't uh i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i uh
i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers
i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum
and on the other hand i don't
know whether they're doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real
you know the
the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that
[laughter]
i'm not sure i didn't
yeah it's going to be uh
it's uh your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it
[laughter]
that's a good point they uh
[laughter]
they got a little uh
a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time
uh-huh
uh let's see what were some of the other
other points she mentioned topic wise
it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't
if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh
panels or whatever you know committees or investigations
nothing uh
nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think
yeah
does tend to uh push that out of the front page
[laughter]
yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that
[laughter]
yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh
its capacity was short that day or something
i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum
so i'm uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end
nice talking with you
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we
um-hum
yeah
yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot
but there's still a lot more we can do you know i don't recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a
like a a
clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those
because we don't always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah see and
yeah see and here in Lubbock everything's so close i can imagine what it's like up there
yeah
yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall
and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and it's actually metal
it's not plastic i didn't want to buy a plastic one
yeah but Payless Cashways has them and they're metal and i don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad
so
yeah
yeah i don't yeah i don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough
no you could probably just you know
yeah
they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper or see i work at TI
and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board
you know we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know
yeah i'm sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide i'm sure
oh yeah
yeah
yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag
and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag
you know and it's really cute
but i think we're doing better and better all the time i still don't
no there's not going to be any room shortly
you know i don't know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere
yeah so but i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do
but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would [vocalized-noise] would be worth but
yeah
yeah it sure is
yeah
yeah well they'll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later the-
you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there n- there's no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don't want a can a garage full of cans
[laughter]
you know
no they're just not they're not prepared for it
yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure
so
yeah
yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans
so
well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know
if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then
we'll get there
well thank you for talking to me
sure no problem
all righty bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i think we need to do more i- i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up
but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah well i don't i don't get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so
but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk ev- you know every Monday or every other Monday and
have them pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go
you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it
yeah i'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them
uh-huh
uh-huh
do those can crushers work good
uh-huh
yeah because those things i think would just snap you know
oh
i'd i'd have to check into something like that because i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um
you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they
yeah
so i don't know i don't think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but
i need to look into it more you know it's
you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say only they'll only take certain types of paper you know they won't take paper that's shiny
yeah so does my husband yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i don't know what you know i haven't i'm sure they're probably doing that here some
uh-huh i think it's necessary i- i like it you know it makes i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and
and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they're just fine
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i think i think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more so
no no [vocalized-noise]
yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere
yeah
yeah girls put that away
now
yeah i just wish it was a little more conv- convenient to do you know
seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about so
i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so
but yeah
yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so
yeah
uh-huh
that's right
that's right who does that you know people don't have room for that kind of stuff
no and in Texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them so
so you don't
that's right so
i'm pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the [laughter] you know pick it up so
oh
uh-huh
yeah well i need to get b- get better at it so
yeah that's right that's right
hm
that's true
that's right
yeah
well thank you for calling i
okay take care
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay so do you all keep a budget
you don't
well
[laughter]
are you being smart or are you serious
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's funny yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at TI for five years
and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're
you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of
we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house
but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand
so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but
we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because we have um three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off
and we have one car payment that we're [vocalized-noise] i think we have about thirteen months left on it
and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment
um they'll pay [vocalized-noise] our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars
and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect
no we don't [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um
um-hum
really
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh really
um-hum
um-hum
does she have to pay to have it refinanced
um-hum
TIer to
see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he'd uh gotten saved and stuff
and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything
you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen people still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us
and so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know
so we went in and they financed the car for five and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so
you know
yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher
and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers
and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention
but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house
we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free
and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that
and then
right
right
right
right
um-hum
oh really
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so
you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things
yeah
really
oh my
i stopped payment on a check oh that's funny
oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak's and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it
and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it [laughter] but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any
anyway
no we didn't even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today
[noise]
no we don't
no i just i- i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it
and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well
i'm being facetious i'm being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh
or i guess the financial planners the training now we've had it for about four years who got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing
and there's some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh
or a listed liquid account and which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that
okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so yo- you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them are there to pacify situations and some of them are there to prevent things from happening
but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh
we've just been kind of
working on i've been developing it but it's kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union
okay thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have
two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal
they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know so it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans [vocalized-noise] not really the best in the world but
but you know they- they're uh since your husband is is is um uh a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments
but they are they'll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they'll take it
and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it's a ten and a quarter percent
which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something
and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like
i think they even cover that because they want you as a uh uh they want the TIer to be part of the credit union
[laughter]
yeah
well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest but your um p- your payments are lower
oh really
sure
um-hum
yes
you save a lot
if if if if and you need to be very careful
if the loan is set up to have bi- they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments if you because you'll save se- fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan sev- i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan
and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available
i can ha- this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year
yeah but uh [vocalized-noise] those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built
is it's not a lot of the firms that offer mor- mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan
i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man
and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment
over and above your house payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
sure
somebody you trust uh you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town it's it's and it's uh it's really a sin it really is
i got taken on some fire- on firewood
i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for a hundred and thirty four dollars
absolutely pathetic
oh okay well so- well probably something like -at did you call them and tell them you just you just
might be a good idea because because you're going to get what a a check uh
[noise]
so do you have any credit cards
um-hum
okay
um-hum
yeah
yeah i have one card
and i try not to use it but right now it's maxed out
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah um
i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card
i don't have that but i've got you know one of the [vocalized-noise] the
uh instant teller cards
that you can use for point of sale purchases and we use that usually to buy gasoline and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's what they've they've talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that
no
oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash
well because it actually is yeah it's better than cash [laughter]
they don't even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there
right
um-hum
yeah but i'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them
they paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them
she said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out i mean that's funny
[laughter]
yeah
yeah i- i want to still have just one just in case but i'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while
um-hum
yeah well our our limit is you know fairly low
and uh so that's that's one thing that's good
oh i've got another call
okay
all right bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
yes i do i keep uh i have an American Express and a Visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month
but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have
especially since you know it's no longer after this year or after tax year nineteen ninety there's there's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay so it's a
you know gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess
it's just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card
uh-huh that's that's probably enough
absolutely
yeah it's it's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it it really is it's so easy to pull out the plastic
but we're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh i'm sure you're right i don't i don't i don't participate in that but you know a lot of folks do
yeah at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty five thirty days you know interest free for it
but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing
yeah
it certainly does
absolutely
that's right do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that
i see
i see i see i
it certainly is yeah
uh-huh
that's right no returned checks or anything
yeah
no i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do we're not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to
but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards it's just you know too easy to do
that's right
[laughter]
well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it
that may not be a bad idea
[laughter]
but i'm kind of
getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway
so we
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's right my wife and i really i guess are fortunate we're really not compulsive shoppers you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that
but uh some people have a real problem with it
uh-huh
sure absolutely
yeah
oh i'm sorry
it was nice talking to you
take care
bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay uh let's see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that
there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things
and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody
i r- i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty
theory i think that's
that's a good way to do it
you know that's about all
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum really
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
right
yeah
right
yeah that's that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh
you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person ju- jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and
the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how
is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that
yeah that's uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
huh yeah
yeah
yeah right that
right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first
and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church
so that's right off that same kind of principle
that's a that's a good idea
yeah that's true that's true too
but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's true in a lot of our um
you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that
and uh so that you know that could work there
um
what is that called the Judo-Christian ethic Judeo-Christian ethic
yeah
right [laughter]
right right
um-hum
yeah that's
[vocalized-noise]
really
[laughter] really [laughter]
really yeah
[laughter] mine too
yeah mine too
yeah same here wha- what part of the country are you from
oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious
okay yeah well i'm i'm from the Dallas area [vocalized-noise] oh okay well that's that's neat
oh are you really wow okay well i'll let you go and it was nice talking to you
oh you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that
for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition
but for anything involving that [noise] a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory
but there should be uh with our
overworked
uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of
of um
not having to take everything
before a
full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh a- as as an example where called a jury duty now
and and maybe instead of of uh
just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do
maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve
and ea- each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude
you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time
uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial
you know we
you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh i believe that
our we- we've become almost litigious uh society where we're e- everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff
and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that
you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone
instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you nee- you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent
need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let
either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing
you bet and if
if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the
yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that
well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know w- that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society
uh t-
and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly
uh
i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you f- i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say
uh that's sort of the Old Testament version
i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject
okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system
but it's been a pleasure talking with you
i'm living here in Texas
well that's quite all right
well so am i [laughter] fact i'm at work out at Lewisville
my pleasure have a good day bye-bye
[noise]
yes
i i
yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if
um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting
[vocalized-noise]
that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so
i thi- i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about
um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good rea-
that's true that's true
um-hum that
i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because
they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i el- if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know
um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have
um that that it does- doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true
i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level
uh
right
um
right but
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well
i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway
you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represent- i i i would guess
that tha- that portion of the population is massively under represented and
hum what do they have to do with one another
oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever
oh i didn't realize that actually that
yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty [laughter]
just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away
well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like respon- responsibilities
no i think
i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to s- you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i
put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly
yes [laughter]
yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on [laughter]
it turns out
that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia
right that that's true [laughter]
right
now if things go the way that that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of
only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so
you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when
when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else
i think that
yeah i think and i i think that's real important
that's probably true
yeah
hum that's good that's tha- tha- that's actually real good
i said well well a- a- the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards
i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards
[laughter] that's very good
that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout
say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think in- inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think
i would hope
um-hum
no oh i've heard of it but not necessarily i've heard it's very controversial though
um-hum
hum
yes
um-hum
that's what
um-hum
hum hum hum well they're elected as well so
[laughter]
so
so they're going to be
but
that- that's true that's true well [vocalized-noise]
well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge
but on the other hand
right
that's right
um-hum
so how do you think we can get people to vote [laughter]
i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think i- b- but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win
to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else
[laughter] so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um
anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person [laughter]
but i suspect that that that would actually never work [laughter]
um-hum
[laughter] that's an interesting notion
that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah
[noise]
all right we need to discuss the voters
on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter
oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news me- media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh they had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know
and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference
due to the overabundance of news we have available to us
what do you think on the local elections though
oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing
and uh i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well
i think that the people that are u- have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education
[noise] tend not to be registered
and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would
and i believe in this but
i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that
i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury
[laughter]
[laughter] that's i i i just i tha- i just wandered off from that one i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection
so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury
there is convoluted logic for you
yes
oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination
that's a good point you're probably right
which
and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout
a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote
and their vote didn't count [laughter]
or any one shows up
total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle
oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too
y- yeah i thin- well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here
you know
oh okay
[laughter] was was that the time no that was l- eighty four that's too soon she said something about uh
Ginger Rogers d- did everything Fred
Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels
[laughter] she said that i didn't said you know don't tell me what women can do [laughter]
i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did
well and some of the issues are so emotional
you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning
i
everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county
but
i've heard so many statements that i've lost track
i honestly at this point
it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow
what the sto- the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided
i wonder about them at some point
that's correct
and that's an- and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed
are they politicians
sure
or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because
it's it's difficult
it's situational really
uh
uh
oh
hum
well this is true this is true i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box
a dollar bill comes out the bottom
that might work in some places
[noise]
[noise]
all right what are some of your favorite foods i imagine with Argentina you've got some great foods
uh-huh
yes uh
i've had i've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous uh i have [vocalized-noise]
i have to find a place around here that has that
okay i'll keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family
you ever serve that yourself when you have company
uh-huh
yeah
oh that
do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you don't you don't go buy it from a a wholesaler
little butcher shops yeah
yeah i- i've lived in Mexico so i know [laughter]
yeah yeah
yeah you have to you have poultry place what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it
yeah i the turnover the stuffed turnovers oh i love those uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker
it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nine- the early seventies
yes so that mu- that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then
okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things
yeah i'm Italian
uh-huh
yeah well because there're many Italians in Argentina
um-hum
uh-huh yeah
my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century
actually actually a little bit later like nine- uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen
[laughter]
yeah well i'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here i'm of Italian descent my husband is Chinese
so we and we both love Eu- Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don't d- we don't usually mix i mean that's well sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe
and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes
and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one
and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it
and chop some scallions and a little ginger
and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful
um flavorful piece of fish yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish mar- uh the fish counter
um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good
and even grouper
little bit of soy sauce and sesa- sesame seed oil
and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scall- um you know slivers of scallions
and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just
just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though
yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet Chinese sauce
well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N
H O I
S I N or S E N either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown
and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork
and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper
and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry
just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce
that you can serve over rice
um well for two people um Ame- uh if it's American style i'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish
um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i'd probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could
and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know
yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables
just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side another dish
um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals
you know
oh no no no no no it's not it's not expensive at all it's o- it's one of the Chinese cooking basics
yeah well listen it was good talking with you
hope you enjoy your recipe
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
all right
mine well
yeah well we got um a lot of uh European dishes well we got we got what some people call the best beef in the world
so it's uh Bishu like every Sunday you go out and you buy all these parts of the cow and then you just cook them over a grill that's like in our house it's already built in there's this whole special place in the back so that you can make a barbecue
yeah
yeah
and then
well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown
so um uh
excuse me
oh no well see what happens is i'm only twenty two but like wh- like when i'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know and i'll and i'll cook it
you know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on and then you know you put all these different meats which take different times
no but uh what happens is in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever and so
and so they got they got the meat place and so you just go there and you can't find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken
well basically it's what we call empanadas which is which is like r- right meat turnovers
and uh then we also put sausages on a bun and then that's that's to start out with and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad
and uh that's about it
uh no
oh okay
yeah
no we we were only there for two years
so
yeah
and uh what what i also eat now since i'm in college [vocalized-noise] i have an Italian roommate and
are you and since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta
and you know like
yeah and my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes and and all this stuff that it's just you know everything like lasagna and everything
oh okay
yeah that's
a- at one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian like pure Italians
okay
okay
right
right
[noise]
yeah
yeah yeah
okay
okay
okay
is it
because i was uh you know it's like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish and you know i've seen you know the filet
what kind of fish
okay
so we put soy sauce and sesame
okay
okay
okay because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water
yeah
no i don't
wait wait wait H wait ah
H O I
S I N okay
okay
okay
okay
how how much uh how much uh
how much pork do you buy for two people
right
yeah i cou- i could probably go half a pound
so but there's there's just since i'm from Argentina i just love meat and we just
okay
okay
and how much does it cost
yeah
oh okay
yeah okay i thought it maybe it was like you know like five fifty or something
so
oh okay
same here
all right thank you bye-bye
[noise]
well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in
all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves
and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer
um-hum
yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requi- general education requirements um
if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to [laughter] that's what i did [laughter]
[laughter] i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go
uh political science
where are you at
well yeah i guess everybody's in Dallas that i talk to i'm in north Carolina
yeah right
sure
oh yeah
um
uh-huh
yeah it does Um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned
uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn't want it
Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either [laughter] haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up
and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like
and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now
and i'm pretty happy with it so far
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah that's probably very useful
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] yeah yeah
oh good grief
yeah
yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way
maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing
i am a dis- i am i am just a disgruntled person all around [laughter] i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess
yeah bah humbug Yeah i just
oh you probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school
well that remark in itself is a slam my best friends are lawyers you know like like uh you know my best friends are blacks [laughter]
[laughter] jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess uh Iraqi now is the [laughter]
law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school
and it doesn't become fun anymore
[noise]
yeah you going
oh yeah Yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse
it is
yeah very much so yeah it's it's a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while
um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer
to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years
but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world i mean it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law
[noise]
what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too
yeah
yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh uh command post
i was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance
were you in SAC
SAC
oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C one thirty fives
oh
[laughter] well that's
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that's right and it
and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it
uh-huh sure
that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at McDonald's
yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a people person i i i hate um
having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in
i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that
which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot
okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh
information about selecting a school
uh-huh
yeah
uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years
but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah what was your degree in
political science oh okay well [noise] i kn- i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh UTD University of Texas Dallas
i know well that's where Texas Instruments is
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine
a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public
um institution
and uh it's a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years
and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh
well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major
uh-huh
um-hum
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter] okay
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
um
yeah yeah i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field i'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and
yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics
and some psychology so it's all working together the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really
so it's a
uh-huh
[laughter]
um
oh
so you are a disgruntled graduate student [laughter]
oh
[laughter]
yeah bah humbug
[vocalized-noise] i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about
fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about uh their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms [laughter] no
no there was a woman she said [noise] my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just [laughter]
yeah i know it was
or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know
yeah
[laughter] i know it but
yeah
yeah i have a [noise] i have a friend she's studying she's going into law another friend going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be
you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled [laughter]
yeah
yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an [vocalized-noise]
i guess uh [noise] United States Institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh
i was in the Air Force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with
yeah
yeah well what was your job
uh
i was i was a linguist
hum
in TAC
uh no i wasn't
no no i didn't i didn't go flight crew matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short
i didn't make -t i sort of washed out
[noise] yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know children really need to
think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it
yeah i i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are
yeah
oh and i tell you what i worked at McDonald's as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where
[noise] i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a la- as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
that's good i was just wondering um
getting back to the school thing so i mean i
i- i almost wish that there was some
well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote
i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are m- my favorite kinds of programs
uh-huh
well the
yeah [noise]
[laughter]
no well i don't think we get it here
huh-uh
oh what kinds of things do they uh show
oh my word
uh-huh [laughter]
oh my word
[laughter]
uh-huh
probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them
is that right
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening
uh-huh
yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
oh yeah right um-hum
do you
oh yes that's a good program uh-huh
oh okay
[laughter]
well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing
yeah
[laughter]
did they
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
well great
course i have to admit i- i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football
and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon [laughter]
well and not everybody is
[laughter]
yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football
yeah i because i always hate to see it end in January i'd like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy
going to baseball games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching basketball on television they're they're both well baseball's so slow
and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot and um
uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh de- develop
and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world
but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring
but i- i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow
yes we certainly do
[laughter]
are you
um-hum
sure right i guess so
um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they haven't done very well the last couple of years but uh they'll be back up there
yeah they'll they'll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium i've been there that is a phenomenal place
[laughter]
well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed
oh i well i have and they're very noisy
and uh then of course i've been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that's just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh
but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it's it's all open also
two yeah
yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah
so uh they [vocalized-noise] they've got a lot of sports going on around here [laughter]
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh yeah
well i uh
i'm retired from education i
worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system
and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns
yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and
we have tickets waiting for us
yeah
yeah
oh
oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here
[laughter]
yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing
well i- i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level
and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more
and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the [noise] the uh physical education
and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and
and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and
to uh try to resolve problems within schools [laughter]
yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and
they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam
so what is your favorite TV program
yeah uh um i've watched Murder She Wrote a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like Columbo but there i- what is opposite Murder She Wrote there's something else that i watch i think it's that fam- home video show
that Famous Home Video is what's opposite it here i don't know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh people send in have you ever watched that where they
oh they send in they do videos of funny things that happen at home you know and then send it in and they show it on TV and oh boy i tell you what it's it's hysterical
oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a lady i don't know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dish- [vocalized-noise] her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught
and she couldn't get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me [laughter] and so what what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her husband was
say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and
just real funny things you know people skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just rea- it's it's really a good program i really enjoy that
i know it and then some the winner the one that's voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know
i often think gee i wish i had a video camera because i could sure use ten thousand dollars so but i like things like Evening Shade with Burt Reynolds i really enjoy that and uh
i really like that that's a good show and i like Rosanne now i know not many people probably like Roseanne but
[laughter]
[noise] well she doesn't sing on her show but i- i do enjoy seeing that
and uh uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have
and i- i like that you know so i don't know i guess i just like a v- variety of things and every day i just tape Regis and Kathie Lee
do you like them
i watch them every day i tape them well not this week because it's uh they're on vacation so it's just old tapes but
but every i run my VCR while i'm at work i i tape that and i watch it every evening when i come home and i don't know what it is about that show that's different about other talk shows
yeah and she's so cute and her and Frank and the baby and i don't know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for about a year year and a half well
yeah i guess about a year and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a station before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the station and complained i said
you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it'll ever be back and they said no we don't think it will be well that was channel eleven and now it's on channel four
so i'm really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so
oh
my mother does too i'm not a big i used to be a football fan i don't know what happened i'm just not a football fan anymore
yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just don't know she lives in California and i do not call her on Sunday in foot- during football season i just don't do it
you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just don't call her and now they're starting up with new football
it's
you think it's seasonal you think it goes with the season
yeah
[laughter]
but you watch it
[noise]
oh listen to it
yeah
yeah
now see in Ohio you really have four seasons don't you
well we kind of do but ours [laughter] our it its hot here i'm in shorts
and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they don't end till like November i mean it's hot so we watch football in the heat here
so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people
oh
oh well i know
i think so i think they did better this last year so
yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though [laughter] it doesn't look finished
[vocalized-noise]
i've never been in an enclosed one
yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas
that's right they have the Colts now like
yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis
ah to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh it's probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because there are some fans there and i guess that's a big game
oh
oh how neat
oh
on that's wonder- oh that's what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football
oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that
yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or
oh my gosh
so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher
oh that's wonderful
okay well now i'm from Dallas
well actually i'm living in Dallas i'm not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid
well obviously it's it's kind of a desert area
um-hum real close New Mexico anyway
well he Dallas is and that's since i've moved up here now so i'm starting to get a little bit of this but
i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller uh parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic
um
the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had st- standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before
right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a a [vocalized-noise] a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter
i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me
oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we've had uh we've had several days in the eighties in fact i'll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn't do it
i didn't do it but i came close
um-hum
i would imagine yes
um-hum
right
um-hum
well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so
so that's
hum well yeah that's i heard that
um-hum
um-hum well that's that's sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh
yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um
you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the fungus and the the trees you know [vocalized-noise] yeah well
but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they've had um
multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that
pollen count yeah exactly
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited
winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did uh even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter
and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there [laughter]
yeah
yeah that
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
oh yes it's a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses
to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will [vocalized-noise] he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only person i know
that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here uh compared to what he's used to so
um-hum
well i think that's true yeah
although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get
too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it's desert and there's not a lot of trees and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated
seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles and miles you know
well now that's that's not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can't stand it here
they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean
exactly
yeah i see i wouldn't have thought that from the beginning but uh i've talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess
hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either
yeah yeah that sounds good
um-hum
okay well
it was yeah nice talking to you too um-hum bye-bye
[noise]
oh okay
uh-huh
okay
right getting uh close to Mexico or
all right and no
and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid
Dallas is
uh-huh
i see
oh
oh [laughter] you have to get used to hills [laughter]
yeah
oh that's good
oh that's good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now
oh that's pretty warm already
oh is that right
actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last
year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what we're having right now is a lot of overcast
you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually we've had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and it's a very windy month
um but right now we're in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable
yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or some- somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long you know
yeah and uh then after after this month it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean Mar- April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh
by May we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even l- low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months
yeah
right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are
um-hum
yeah
oh right [vocalized-noise]
air quality index yeah
oh
right
is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well we're just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we're probably a few weeks behind
uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh
that lasts everything's in bloom you know everything's green here till about October and then we lose it all
but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldn't be too many months that that trees were were bare because it's it's hot most of the time
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
i see
oh okay here it's sixties and we're celebrating okay so there's that's the difference i remember being in Louisiana a few times and and it was uh
i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked
to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess it's what you become acclimated to yes
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah yes
right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it
that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to is what what you enjoy that's right
um-hum
right
yeah i can understand that sure yeah i mean no i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to uh go to a desert type of area either you know you get once you're in greenery you get spoiled by that you know
no
oh is that right
ah that's interesting
um-hum
yeah yeah so i guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces huh that that that yeah that that's interesting so
yeah i think i'll take the area with trees huh yeah yeah
right [laughter] why am i too nice [laughter] yeah that is pretty good oh but anyway well i that's that's about all [vocalized-noise] you know i have right here on on this area so
okay well nice talking to you alright w- bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
so [noise] um well i'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home
and um her son which is my father
is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven
so um
it's strange because it it so hit so close to home
but um um my father's an only child and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother she had many sisters and a couple of them took care of her
and then one her last sister died and it was
probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was
and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old
but her personality is is very grating [laughter] i mean i hope i don't get like that when i get old so
yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate
um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one
um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations
um this one is [vocalized-noise] more or less for someone who who's poor and can't go there and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy but he's quite well off
and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer um home but up here there's waiting lists and that was the first one that opened and i suggested to him why don't you change
um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice
so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job
i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions
especially down the southern part of the st- the country which is
oh that's terrible
well that's good so is your grandmother um impaired is she of Alzheimer's or something like that
oh
oh that does happen yeah
yep
you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and
they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her an- and that what happens a lot when when people are sick
or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes and it's like oh well but that's it's it's i'm really glad that i come from an area where um
that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place
they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know
i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really f- i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really um
when my father when something if anything happens to him
i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh
in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day
because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because uh
like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars
and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work an-
so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two li- dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like
over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all
you know it's like oops dad's got these two and the old one dies and the young one goes for a while and he gets another one so i can't see him with- without his animals even though it's very expensive to stay at home
mentally it's just the best thing for you i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have
and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think
if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i- i don't want to be a s- selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through
and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place
i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and [vocalized-noise] it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight [laughter] it it's really it's bad thing
but [vocalized-noise] when they go into the homes they lose weight and li- because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know
my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these
old fashioned foods they're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat
just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment
and have it on you know one floor and really easy access well that's what i'm telling my father now he needs a new floor in his bathroom and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and out
[noise]
jeez
yes i'm i'm i have some great concerns about uh m- my parents and my relatives reaching that age
um around here where i live in Maryland in the Washington area there's there's and uh i used to live down in Dallas
there was just so many stories about uh rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions in fact here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down
and taken all the people out of them because they were so uh bug infested and rat infested and it i- you know really concerns me that
um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that but if you have to
you know how do you make sure i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face
um you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there
you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there and you know
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes uh that's true my uh my grandmother's um last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches
that uh she even ha- you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her there were roaches even in her alarm clock um
yes it was absolutely horrible they took her immediately out of there and they just threw everything away
that that she had from there i mean they wouldn't even take the uh the uh the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs they just left everything
and uh bought her all brand new stuff and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there
and explained to the uh person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had ta- they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening and they they put her into that opening
[noise] i'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her um up until nineteen eighty two
uh actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother
prior to that i was told that she was dead and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution
and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
yes
you know
yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah my mother has made similar statements that she doesn't want to become a burden to the family you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know [laughter] there are the lines that come from her and uh
and i tell her you know no problem mom always got a place for you but uh
uh-huh
[noise]
okay have you ever served as a juror
uh-huh
i never have either
well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems
true
yeah i think that's true
[laughter]
yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge
yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and
uh-huh
if they give them all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and
the judge decides whether or not they should hear it
right
yeah
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other
i think it does have to be unanimous
i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but
i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury
and
yeah i thi- i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh
majority might be sufficient
it's hard to say though i
oh
yeah i hadn't thought about international trials at all
right
yeah
yeah
yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street
for something like that because of the cultural differences
things like that
yeah what about uniform sentencing
right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years
you know
yeah i
yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble
yeah i don't believe that very often happens
i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad
yeah
i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them do something that's not pleasant
and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and
yeah
yeah something besides license plates and tiddlywinks
yeah
yeah
well i think that covers it
it was nice talking to you
um bye
you too [noise] bye
[noise]
never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors
you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides
TV shows
no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the aff- aff- affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature
[noise] i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to de- to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh
the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment
um-hum
that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death
you know the death penalty and such
uh-huh
right
yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail
although you still hear about those occasionally
um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial
and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury
and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent
and they took it more as just like a majority
so i- i
exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous
but uh
rather interesting
uh-huh i did i did also
[noise]
uh-huh
what about in international
trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting
i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts
like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them
nobody
so
but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know [vocalized-noise] people from different countries
uh in as international law also
um-hum
right
i don't know how what it what it would take to be come up with a true perfect
system or if one exists but
uh is that the crime and it's already [vocalized-noise] false due to some chart and determine the punishment or
um-hum [noise] i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh
i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature
i
yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that
and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life
yeah although i guess it's your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time
no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just
yes it's another war zone
but
who knows
i agree get them out there
sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them
exactly
trading their lives for cigarettes
those kinds of things
well good
i think so
nice talking to you also
have a wonderful Easter
bye
[noise]
want me to press the one button
okay sir
[noise]
Jack do you have any pets
Jim i'm sorry about that do you have any pets
okay well that would kind of preclude having a pet
hum
uh-huh
well we've got we've got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City
in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor
and and uh they don't uh generally they eat their pets
uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them don't have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store
and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old
and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back
and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean
yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air
and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him
it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up
oh okay what did you have
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
yeah they they they lived outdoors and you know
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah th- they're
and it's amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz
and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground
and
huh
um-hum
oh okay
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia
and we were told when we got there that it'd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies
and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil
so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay
now the other fifty percent was pa- some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn't have any qu- any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA
uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet
uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play badminton
but i'm i'm a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and i'd put her leash on and take her running with me
and it was only years later i read that you shouldn't do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back she'd drink about three panfuls of water [laughter]
but an- it wasn't it wasn't in the heat of the day i'd always go running about seven o'clock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready i'd get that leash and she'd come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go
and and
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah
[laughter]
oh for goodness sake
um-hum
right
i'm sure
well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run
fortunately people are responsible and they've all been spayed or neutered so we don't have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh it's interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and she's got six or seven cats
and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally
uh when the door was open and found where our cat's food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them sleep in the garage at night
and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because he knows i'm going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days
he'll follow me up the front walk so i'll run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and he'll he'll go around and beat me there so i've got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door
so i- i can i can get in without him but he's he's he's fat as a
yeah he's he's he's
he's fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or he's going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me you've got to stop feeding and i said i don't do it intentionally i and if i'm in the house
already sometimes i can keep him out if i'm trying to come in the house and he's trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while i'm i'm trying to uh get in the door and that works
but other times i'll forget that he's out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out he's by me like a shot and by the time i can get him he's got a great big gigantic mouthful of food
no i- i think i- i- i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat
and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers
and uh except when it's extremely cold and we don't get many days like that here in Texas
i'm ready whenever you are
Jim
[laughter]
no no i do not i uh i live in an apartment
well
well not really most of my neighbors
have pets dogs
of course
[laughter]
i agree and how they you know the uh
the uh health officials let him in the country
[laughter]
i always had pets when i grew up
oh i had uh i started with a
cat
uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom but i had dogs primarily and uh
mostly purebreds
but uh
we had a large yard
and uh we did not have the pets in the house
uh they all they were always outdoors
[laughter]
but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh
uh when i was living in in uh Pensacola Florida uh we had a uh cat that
i got fr- again from a friend it was born in a barn
uh it was they had a a small farm so there were lots of cats around
so i picked out one and got it for my daughter and uh had it uh spayed and
declawed
and we did keep it in the house
restricted to the uh first floor
and it was uh not a bad experience but for the most part i'm i'm reluctant to have animals in the house i just i just don't do not feel that
particularly dogs uh i do not feel that they
fare well
uh in the in the house
[laughter]
um-hum well i yeah i had a malamute at one time
and uh stayed outside
i was raised in southern West Virginia
so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would
sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night [laughter] and uh you know it's uh
wolf origins uh came to the fore particularly during the full moon and but i always had uh dogs i had a terrier
first and then i had a uh
let's see i had a terrier then i had a cocker spaniel
then a
then the uh malamute
and then the last dog i had was a uh basset hound
but they all stayed outside
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
um
[laughter]
right
um-hum
yeah i bet
well the you know the last one we had the the uh my uh
my father owned a plumbing and heating business and my brother and i
frequently worked for him during the summer when my brother was in college and i was in high school
and so uh this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the automobile
and so we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job
pack it a lunch
and it would you know get out of the car and find a nice cool spot to rest and
my brother and i would go work and we'd come uh
break for lunch and and the uh
unpack the dog's lunch and so forth and the other workers the
the carpenters and so forth used to get just a hell of a charge out of it
because you know here are these two guys you know walked in with clean clothes you know every day my my of course my mother wouldn't let us leave the house without the clean clothes
you know with a dog and bringing a dog on the job and they didn't realize we were working for my father so [laughter] that uh
it was uh but the people around here they're you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh
pets
of course they you see them out walking every evening but they range you know the couple upstairs that uh above me uh has a long hair dachshund
uh the lady is German
but uh there are some huge dogs around here it's really phenomenal i cannot see i mean i've seen everything from
you know Great Danes and German Shepherds and just really huge animals and how they keep them confined
uh the the apartments are are fine they're relatively large but
to stay there all day is fan- you know fantastic
um-hum
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
it's amaz- yeah it's amazing how they get conditioned it it really is
[laughter]
well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
this is like one of the worst topics i've had because i'm a terrible dresser
i'm really not that bad of a dresser but um where i work um it's very casual dressing
so i can wear jeans and um pretty much a sweater or even a T-shirt to work i- i-
yeah well we i work in a manufacturing plant so we don't i don't have to deal with customers or anything bu-
no actually i'm at work right now i work at night and i'm using this phone as one of my you have to have two phones i'm using one of these
yeah well i sit here i'm taking a course and i study when i stu- when i uh read my course while i'm trying to get through so i'm just make a couple a night though [laughter]
oh you see that's i almost wish i had a job like that so it would force me to dress nice
yeah because i can slough off and then when it comes things out or or i go out to dinner or something or or not not so much going out to dinner i have like three or four dresses that i can wear something li- business interview
i went for another job in a different company and it's like i go right over to my sister's house what do you got to wear
yeah w- and it's it's really convenient we're twins too so it works out [laughter]
yeah she just had to change her whole wardrobe because she's going up like a management ladder and even though she still has to work i mean do some lot of physical work and adjust her machines
um she still has to dress for success as they say
so she went out and she changed her whole her whole wardrobe
yeah
that's true yep
i know because you know even like i ironed a shirt to come to work tonight you know just a nice blouse and if i was going to wear it with a suit or something i would have had done a a ten times better job
yeah and i- it's got to be more expensive [laughter]
[laughter] yep but that's what's you have when when you have to deal with the public or deal with the customers they like that that business su- suit
ri-
[noise]
do
boots
do you have to do you find that you you can [vocalized-noise] a- are you happy with wearing dress slacks instead of dresses because i know a lot of people who dress it's usually dresses dresses they har- hardly don't wear dress pants or anything
yeah
see all the girls that i know i know a couple girls that work in insurance offices and that's all they they wear are dresses they hardly ever wear pants then on the weekends you know they wear their jeans and their sweats
but the- they uh the pants just aren't dressy enough but in the wintertime i think i would be wearing [laughter] [vocalized-noise] pants
ye- yeah
yeah
yeah even even here the secretaries they usually dress nice but it's not strange to seem them in jeans and a sweater
so and you know sometimes it is on Fridays but in the summertime if they're going to like i know a couple of the girls and this one lady goes camping a lot and like every Friday she's sh- you know she still does her same function and everything
but uh normally she's dressed to the T she's just perfect
yeah well we're fortunate here because the building's um very um climate controlled
but we work in an electronics field and we have to wear polyester smocks so it's usually um a tank top in the Summer and then silk and polyester are the only things that are close enough to being dressy
and they and [vocalized-noise] polyester's terrible on me and i wear my silk under this polyester uh smock and you just get so hot even though it's a nice temperature in here so you really in the summertime have to
we have to dress extra light because we have to wear these smocks [laughter]
yeah and in the wintertime pretty much just uh um even a turtleneck's all right because you have to wear these smocks a turtleneck and a sweater and the smock would be too much it it gets really hot
so it's kind of weird when it's really cold w- we come in pretty much we ha- take our coat off and then we take our outside sweater off
trucking through the parking lot [laughter]
yeah
but they still they have to keep the pants really just
but
yeah and their shirts have to be pressed so they still have the same thing where if they could dress casually it would take them less time too
but i know what it's like i mean just putting on a pair of panty hose can take you an extra five minutes
yeah
oh i know um even my dress shoes i don't wear them a lot i notice the wear on the bottom of them
and there's no way i could wear them all day i would be the one of the women in flats [laughter]
well i'm pretty short but i have a very bad knee i couldn't
couldn't walk in heels all day when i go dancing i i- i going out i'm like [vocalized-noise] i- i stand the ball on my foot hoping i don't slip on my heel because if my if i s- if i jam down on my heel too much my knee doesn't catch and
it's bad well it's
no we don't at all um we used to be a lot busier so um we it used to be important what you wore if you're comfortable because you knew you were going to spend a lot of time working
and now it's very slow and i pretty much i've taken a couple courses and no- now i sit at my desk and i and i read read my courses
i'm a technician so i've taken a couple technical courses plus i go take a couple college courses li- i've taken um some business courses
just uh it's gets boring to stay here technical courses learning about power supplies in computers and yeah
yeah this
okay
okay so it do you think it's been five minutes see i never time these
oh okay so we can end our call okay
yeah oh who knows di- did you have you ever gotten duplicate people
no i y- i'm almost afraid to get duplicate people [noise] i don't know why
okay well
yeah okay okay bye yeah you too
[noise]
[noise]
oh re- [laughter]
oh
geez that's great
um-hum
um-hum do you work during the day
oh
[noise]
oh i it's a good idea
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
oh okay well that's good well i um i work actually in a different sort of environment i work in a uh personnel agency [noise] a temporary agency
and so for me i'm always out with customers or with uh employees and i practically have to wear a suit everyday
oh really well uh
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
oh well at least there's you know does she wear the same size
oh wow that's great [noise] well
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
[noise]
um-hum the the thing that kills me is that we have dress down days sometimes at work you know where can throw on jeans and i swear i can sleep an extra half an hour
if i don't have to get up and put on panty hose and fix the skirt and button shirts and y-
you know i i just i love it when i can get up and throw on sweats or just throw on jeans and tie sneakers and [noise] and i'm fine [noise]
um-hum
right plus ironing the suit on top of that you know
yeah right that's true [noise] that's true
yep exactly
[noise]
when it comes to Winter though my my goal is to stay warm
and i don't even care how i look i mean i i'll have
a turtleneck and then a sweater on top of that and then a jacket on top of that i mean i just i get cold very very easily [noise]
and so um i i mean i don't even touch sh- shoes when i'm outdoors i just wear boots and like two pairs of socks and
yeah
right well i'll only do that on Fridays
Fridays are you know a little bit more relaxed day
yeah
yep
oh yeah me too
um-hum
oh it's really horrible um i it got s- Rochester gets so cold that sometimes i'll just have to wear like leggings until i get to work
and take them off because it really really does get cold but um
i would love a job where i didn't it it wouldn't be casual all the time but i didn't have to be dressy all the time and i could wear more fun clothes
you know what i mean
uh-huh
oh really
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
and in the Summer it's hard because it's so hot
you just
oh that's great
[noise]
oh
uh-huh
um-hum
i know
yeah
right which is like adding another layer
um-hum i know
yeah
yeah i know
oh geez well you know it doesn't seem fair for because guys i mean i feel like all they have to do is change a tie
and they've got a whole new outfit
well that's true
yeah they have to keep looking sort of clean and pressed
yeah
yeah
that's true
i know and then you know if you run one forget it you not only lo- you know spend another four bucks but
you know take that extra time and i mean another thing that kills me is i walk in heels all day and i wear out the bottom of my shoes so quickly on the pavement and and i'm spending like you know
instead of buying new shoes i'm always repairing them and again that's like four dollars each time to bring in a pair of shoes and get new heels put on
um-hum the the nails start showing through and that sort of thing
yeah
oh [laughter] well i'm too short to wear flats if i wore
oh
uh-huh
oh jeez oh it must be painful yeah
do you stand all day at your job or you
um-hum that's great
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
good for you
that's great
well i'll be thinking of you dressing casually [laughter] at night [noise] when i go to work
oh yeah it's i- i was timing it because i came in uh it's been about seven minutes
okay
yeah [noise] well Linda take care it was really nice talking to you
[vocalized-noise]
no have you [vocalized-noise]
oh
that would be fun though
jus- pick up where you left off [laughter]
[laughter] alrighty
take care bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or
uh-huh
do you like uh do you like Cheers
Chee-
Night Court
yeah i i think that's pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court
but i also i also like Star Trek and that's kind of an adventure i guess you would call it
yeah
yeah that's true
yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves
you don't want to see it it's like three hours long and it just drags on forever
well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and and don't you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so [vocalized-noise] it's not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though it's only half an hour
yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while [laughter] get away from real life
[vocalized-noise] because i i mean i don't know it's just something i think something we need
[laughter]
as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress
and Cheers does it i don't know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers it's it's pretty funny it's it's kind of you know the extremes of of certain characters
yeah the syndicate
yeah they when when they'll show one one episode in one channel and like in the next day they'll show it on another one
yeah
right where i where i where i'm at right now is in a dorm and we don't have the uh we don't have cable so i just get regular TV but
we see it uh every day at six o'clock
yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays
yeah
well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years
that's pretty good i mean it's it's not something you see every day so it's i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher
uh-huh so it's even closer to you
uh-huh
i never ever really got into Bob Newhart
no i don't i don't i never never saw that
i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here
so i you know there's a gap in my TV viewing but recently that's basically what i watch is Cheers and
and uh
and Night Court because they're r- they show them back to back
[laughter]
yeah
well
yeah
no i don't i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because it's they're th- they don't keep my interest i- i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time
looking at that and you know and if it's if it's funny or if it keeps my interest if it's exciting i'll watch it if not i don't and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn't any wasn't great
Thirty Something i watched a few times because there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it
but uh i guess it's because it's not aimed for an audience of my age
no i'm i'm in my twenties my early twenties and so
i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah well
that that way you'll you'll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is [laughter] is really
yeah
what was wise guy
oh
i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it
did you have you ever seen that that show they [vocalized-noise] i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that
i heard i heard it really sucked
because uh it was supposed to be something like a sh- uh singing and like like a musical but yeah
like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something
no
i can see why it crashed
[laughter]
well it was nice talking to you
[laughter] yeah
oh well i'll get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery
all right bye
[noise]
[noise]
i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i'm not much interested in
[noise] yeah [noise] i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something
i like Night Court
in fact it's on right now
yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek
and i don't really care to watch movies because
it's committing too much time i think
you know you never know what's going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows it's a little different than
you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued [noise]
no i haven't
that's what i've heard
[laughter]
i think
yeah and it's a just a nice escape
and you know it's something to laugh at and enjoy and
right
exactly
exactly that's that's what i like
yeah
yeah yeah you're right about the other you're right they are now that i think about it [noise]
yeah i watch it it's on he- it's on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels
i'm sorry i think i must've i've probably seen every episode about three or four times
well yeah but r- um let's see here they've got it
they've got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel
and so you know
oh okay
uh-huh the older one
yeah
i'm trying to think what other shows i like there there's just oh just television has changed so much and uh
[vocalized-noise] there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be
i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don't
yeah i like that
well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period so
yeah it's kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories
um
i don't know i like do you like um i don't know if if you're [noise]
you would know like Barney Miller do you ever
watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show
never got into those
the ol- i'm talking about the old one when he was a psychologist
don't remember those
i don't know my friends don't like my TV TV they think it's trashy but uh
well yeah
yeah
back to back [vocalized-noise] when i was in college you know we didn't have TVs
and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch TV but
i hate that span of giving you have to give up a lot of TV when you when you're [laughter] when you're going to school lot of things you have to give up when you're going to school
but uh
sounds like we have real similar ta- we ha- tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go do you what about the do you like L A Law or
is that all
uh-huh
yeah
um
yeah probably not
about ten years [laughter]
yeah ten years down the road for you but um
those are really the only two drama shows that i like
and i tell everybody don't call me [laughter]
but other than that i you know i like [vocalized-noise] i um i'm recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so
i get to see just about everything
yeah but who cares about my opinion [laughter]
i like the uh
i don't know it seems like that some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air
it was a cop show
but
yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it's all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn't in it and anyway it's a long
i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now
did it
oh really
[laughter]
you're kidding
maybe i should have [laughter] surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i don't know
i don't think it was supposed to be funny though
you know
nice talking to you i guess you'll get to watch all of Night Court
i've missed the first ten minutes
i'm sorry i'm just teasing thanks
bye bye
[noise]
well how many credit cards do you have
[laughter] sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one
and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out and it and it uh
it it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when AT&T came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and we've been using that one
uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills
well did um were you able to get one while you're in college
just curious because i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student
uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that
well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in mo- the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's
yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk
yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some [vocalized-noise] there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for conven-
a convenience
yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash
the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook a-
she writes the checks and i record them so it's uh
it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up wi-
on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer
and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of
uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on
uh things like uh like the credit union's offering
yes
yeah
the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and
and they make more money if you extend your loan
yes
and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or any- they're not going to keep on if the car were older
the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt
at least from a tax standpoint so
it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so
it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things
i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit
oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you
yeah it's on uh yeah
yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the
oh okay
it's on it's on schedule um
schedule a under uh
well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage
uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint
but uh
anyway [laughter]
sounds like you're you're very respon- very financially responsible it's uh
that's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's
uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks [laughter] boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that
i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that
it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year
yep
miscellaneous things like food -nd and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn
well anything else good to say about credit cards
i might just
you don't have to carry the cash and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and
yeah
they don't allow they don't do tha-
yeah huh
carry all that cash with you
well you know they they
they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you
yeah and i think that's where
yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid
in general that uh they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and
you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but the- the- they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh
the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh
the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so
anyway well it's good talking to you
maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night
[noise]
[noise]
[noise]
um
i've only i've got about four maybe
i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them
uh too much and i use my Visa just for abou- for about everything and i pay it all off
so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically
i'm i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out
um i don't think i ever tried
um
well
[noise]
yeah i i you know it's
you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but
just depends
yeah so basically if you want to take the risk
[laughter] it's your risk
do you trust your your son
uh-huh
uh-huh i'd say do you know
have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something
yeah
uh-huh
the the extended loan payment for your car
yeah i saw that
well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that
yeah and and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old
and so they've already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and they'll recover the loan
uh-huh
yeah
yeah uh
what now what's ten percent we can deduct
i didn't know that
i didn't think you could anything on a loan or
i mean a mortgage i know you can
oh i've never itemized yet
so maybe that's
schedule a or
yeah
yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
[noise] and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh
i'll never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and i'm
uh-huh
well you you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and
yeah well
yeah and an-
yeah so
um
yeah they're they're convenient you know that's that's a
probably one big thing about them and
uh
uh-huh
yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in Phoenix
uh
they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something
[laughter]
so uh
that was interesting cause i always you know you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i
yeah i've heard about them
that's mostly locally the banks will line up with uh
yeah
all righty
all righty
take it easy
[noise]
well i i don't think that it's it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance
jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
well how do you f- how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
well what about random testing though
d- do you feel like that's an in- invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested
i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair
um-hum
yeah
well i ha- i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and it's not random
um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh
at the NC double A does have something to do with it but it's almost
discretionary on the coach's part of each in- individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem
a- and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time
well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's
having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to ha- behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset
it's an accusation and and it's and it's b- based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave
uh normal uh you know
right exactly i- it i don't
the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management
um-hum
what type of job do you have
uh-huh
well does your j- re- does your job require you to drive company equipment or to [vocalized-noise] operate any type of machinery that might en- endanger someone
well it that doesn't i- i mean i- i
uh-huh
hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job
uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh
my uh medical record from my old company
so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion
well no i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean th- they don't know that i don't use drugs they just tested me once
but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen
uh were clean
and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly re- uh just across the board
no they're all of them are tested once every three mo- it's a rotation
but it but again it depends on what job you're in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much
but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here
yeah it's it's made very clear upon hiring
well have we spent our at least five minutes [laughter] okay [laughter]
okay [laughter]
nice to talk to you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
all right i agree with that people that are uh driving
like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and i'm not i'm not opposed to any testing i mean
because i know i certainly wouldn't want to uh
you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there
uh
oh um
i was tested uh
within my company i think it's i- i- kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this
and i f- i feel like it's really just within the United States it's um
it's okay i think your record should stand for itself that
you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and
especially if your personality proves that you're not
i think they could uh save money by not doing that
you know every time say if you change jobs th- you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place
oh r-
uh not if it's done fairly and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly
yeah
well they might tell you it's random
but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries
you know
oh i see how'd how did they how do they pick their people
uh-huh
oh i see so do you
right
well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them
to be tested
right
right
[laughter]
right right
yeah [vocalized-noise] it would almost be like a
a uh
uh-huh
right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative
and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs
right
i agree with that
because i know personally myself i've been in the same job for
three years it'll be three years in August and i've already been drug tested three times
[vocalized-noise]
well i'm an environmental engineer
and i've been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus
so see i i for some reason i've come up three times that's pretty high statistics
no no not at all i-
it's a legal job you know
so see it's really strange
oh uh-huh
right
well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for bef- before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and and she came up negative
yeah
right right
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
and are they tested random
they're
oh okay
i see
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see
uh-huh
okay so they know that and they
uh-huh okay
well
yeah
i think so yeah seven twenty five
okay nice speaking to you
o- bye
[noise]
okay it says what kind of car would you buy next what kind of car would you buy next
yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size
was the gas mileage decent or
oh that's not bad
well
oh i've never i've really never had a new car i mean i'm pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars
you know i've i've been -ployed for ten years so i- i have enough money to go out and buy a new one
but instead i go out and buy toys and things [laughter] oh um but
see my situation's really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car
yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he he eventually had his own private junkyard which is
terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and there's seven of us kids
would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so it's you know when we get together and go places
and we meet places it's like gee you guys don't like one kind of car do you
it's a very strange car i don't know y- if you have them down there but it's a Saab
yeah they're not that popular down south i don't
i maybe it's something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in snow but they're very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars
to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didn't charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and
he'd help them out a lot if they were broke down he'd try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money
yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here th- they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um
they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repo- they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it
[vocalized-noise]
can imagine you have a good you have a you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there's more people interested in them too
huh i don't know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they p- they might have been stolen and
the insurance company buys them and they sell them and i've known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title there's
there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted
and they didn't really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn't keep tires on it it kept eating the tires
yep
i know a lot of people who've boughten other cars the same way and and have done very well
i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i s- see it wasn't um
wasn't in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident
so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the
the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so
yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted
that's true but you know i always thought American cars weren't any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it
yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot
and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they're not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because
they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn't it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i- i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior
was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid [laughter] sound
and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted
so i was really impressed if i if i didn't h- have if i didn't buy uh used Saabs
you know if i didn't have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota
but that's one thing about
cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i can't talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are they're very popular and i guess they run
they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record
yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this thing's been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right i'm like what do you mean
he says i haven't tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because he can't afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he can't afford to tune it up
so it it's amazing even when you abuse them
[noise]
all the time
well i- i have problems with my car i'm not saying it's not perfect or anything but i wouldn't trade my Saab for anything i
yeah
it it's a Swedish car i'm just being stupid and sentimental it's just because it's about the only kind of car i've ever had i had a Volvo once
you know it's like if i had to go out if i
to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but i'd have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasn't a Saab i don't know
um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um
it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo
and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and bajaing and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it
and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around
so it it worked out pretty well
i've never had problems really getting getting cars it's it's refusing them
because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know that they deal and sell them [laughter] yes my father's very shrewd with them [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah that's a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that's a hard job
well i you know i always
dream of buying a new car but
yeah i don't it just the money just isn't worth that that shininess
yes they're very expensive i mean e-
well we've been thinking about buying a van
because it'd be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in
and
well i don't know uh a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van last year we took a trip across cross country and it was really nice uh but they are harder to drive because they're so much bigger
we got about eighteen miles a gallon
yeah it wasn't that bad and uh but they are big and they're kind of hard to drive
uh definitely next car we'll get will be a used car because we can't afford a new car they're so expensive
yeah
yeah yeah
is that right
[laughter]
yes
[laughter]
oh yes i've seen them
that might be i don't know
yep
that's the way to go
yeah
yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because i've heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because you can't always just go in and get something right away l- l- like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve
yeah
because Dallas is a pretty big area we got i don't know a million people or a million and a half people or something
that's true [laughter]
yeah
is that right
yeah
hum
yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires
yeah one thing about
oh boy
huh
huh
that's a pretty good deal
i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because i don't trust American made cars now i don't think they have the quality and that's that's too bad because i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money i'm spending i want to get something that's worth my money
uh-huh
is that right
yeah
yeah that's right
yeah that's nice
yeah
that's nice
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i knew a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and he had like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil never had a problem with it
yeah yeah
[laughter]
yeah my wife's brother had a he lives in California and he had a Honda Accord i think and he had like a hundred fifty thousand miles on it and he sold it and uh never had a problem with it whereas i got a Chevette and
it's the car's al- almost twelve years old and i got seventy one thousand miles on it is all and i've had problems with it just all the time
yeah
i bet now isn't that isn't that a Swedish car
or Norwegian or something
yeah
well how did you like your Volvo
uh-huh
yes
that's that's a pretty good deal
i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh she'd be be a travel agent
that way if i needed another car i just go get it and whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good discount and take off
yeah
yeah it is
yeah
who can afford twenty thousand
it's it's hard to- topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do
well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school
yes well yeah i am
um act- actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling
but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC
uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that
well that's really too bad because i- it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned
yeah
yeah
oh they they have that down there that
yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school
yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school
so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program
yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that
that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage
yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if [vocalized-noise] they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about
trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day
so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from
yes are they going to move to uh Mexico [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them [laughter] you know if the industry comes
hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school
because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school
because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you
yeah you hope [laughter] well i think i- i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that
i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in
i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him [laughter] so i don't know it's just like
i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and t- to see what they need and not overinflate it
like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here
we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though
we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa
so
yeah but i always [noise] see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school
who knows bu- maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead [laughter] they seem to have done a the good job in the past
in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so
yeah the i don't
[vocalized-noise]
yeah i don't know if i would do that to my child though [laughter] but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or
or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job
is it
well that
well
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um
we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you
yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or
[noise]
state school
okay but you're excluding high-level education
okay
yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and
having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on
right
well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done
because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools
so you know i- i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier
and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over
well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools
but uh you know
right
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed
right in high school
right
i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care
and
right
yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play
yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward
so oh i don't know
about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south [noise] and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here
i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years
yeah
right
you hope
i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the govern- the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it
you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got
yeah [laughter]
yeah
starts hitting closer to home
yeah they're a lot more strict
you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time
well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school
i- i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in Texas it's next to free because th- they pay so much of it it's state supported
but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad
but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and col- junior colleges that don't have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so
okay [laughter]
well if uh i like to d- i like to make stuffed animals i i sort of have not been doing as much as i did you know before i had to work for real [laughter] but i like to do things like that and uh
you know bottle covers and
that sort of stuff and dancing
the dancing i've i've kept up with because you know you don't have to
well you don't have to get a lot of stuff out you know [laughter]
what do you do
oh
yeah
[laughter]
oh wow
um-hum
yeah yeah
wow
yeah and then it then it puts a lot of responsibility on you
yeah yeah
oh well that yeah
yeah i like to sew too but you know if i'm not in the mood to sew i can screw things up like you wouldn't believe
yeah [laughter] and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least
oh do you really
oh wow how exciting
oh i'll bet
uh-huh
yeah
oh that's neat
yeah
is it is it hard to make it come down where you want to
oh it just comes down when it wants to
yeah
uh-huh
right yeah
[laughter]
yeah well have you flown in one of those where they have a whole bunch that go you know like up at one time
yeah how long have they been doing that
oh well that's neat
what about that one they do in Albuquerque
yeah that's the oldest one isn't it
wow
[laughter] how many do they have like at the Plano one usually
yeah
yeah probably every year it'll
yep
yeah
yeah because those things are pretty expensive aren't they
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i had a friend at TI Detroit a long time ago that had one that a bank
you know had sponsored
yeah
and it looks so pretty when they're all you know when there's a bunch of them that way
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
oh
yeah
[laughter]
wow
sounds fun
oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like
[laughter] yeah i like those i like my- i like murder mysteries too
have you ever read any Dean Koontz
he's he's sort of it's he he's writes real good bu- us- it's the kind though that you don't want to start if you have to put it down very soon
yeah
yeah the he does well they're sort of scary
you know but they're they're just really really good
The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago
and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one it's about this dog named Einstein
and this it wa- he was an experimental government thing you know
and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything
yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better
yeah it was great
[laughter]
you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria
Victoria Holt is that right
yeah those are good i like those
oh really
well that's i
really
yeah
oh what what what one is that
hum
yeah yeah usually the the movies are not as good
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's usually the way it is
sometimes they just change them completely
yeah
like Jaws do you remember Jaw- did you
yeah the book was a lot better i thought
but they just they just
well my dancing is i i like to belly dance
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
well you know it's it's real funny because when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i'll learn that in a couple of weeks ha
yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons for- forever i think
course i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise
you know it's so much fun you don't really think about it
and exercising i mean let's face it exercising stinks [laughter]
oh i go to aerobics classes and stuff but
do you
are you d- do you are you at TI in Dallas so so you go to the fitness center
no
oh yeah yeah i well the only time i can go in too and all these classes that are available are like Saturday
yeah Saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can
yeah well they have uh the they have them like at six
you know here but i
yeah
yeah
yeah that's a lot of fun
well yeah that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you don't really realize that you're working as hard as you are
yeah and it's sort of cute too
yeah
yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my money's worth you know
yeah
um-hum
yeah well it's so neat because it's right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it
um-hum yeah and yeah that's handy and they're just there you know when you want to use them
um-hum
yeah
and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too
do the weights
he'll he'll he would never do an aerobics he'd die before he in aerobics class [laughter]
[laughter] but [laughter] he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that
[laughter] body build huh
um-hum
i think they shave it
yeah and put
[laughter]
and then then oil up i think
okay
[laughter] what kind of hobbies do you have
uh-huh yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
oh
uh-huh
well i sew
clothes you know
that's like a hobby because i don't ever make anybody nothing but me [laughter]
or maybe little kids i've i've done weddings but not no- not big weddings like you know
big big weddings just bride's maid's dresses and stuff like that for people that i know
you know so
[laughter] i don't want to be paid to do it because then it becomes a job and then it's not a hobby you know
and a lot of stress too
you know especially i don't want to do this and i don't want to do that so it's then it's not a hobby it's more of a job but i like to sew you know it calms me down
[laughter]
oh yes and then i go ballooning
hot a-
no hot i go hot air ballooning
yeah in a hot a hot air b-
in a hot air balloon
yes now that's fun [laughter]
and uh well i don't i don't own a balloon but i crew for a guy he owns two balloons
and he'll call us up and say let's go and so we'll meet you know real early in the morning people think we're crazy because we get up so early in the morning but i love it [laughter]
and i always tell people if you ever go up in one you just that's it you be hooked [laughter]
and they're so pretty and you know
well you don't have a choice
well you don't have a choice of where you're going
so when you get ready to come down you have to you know y- it's more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to it's just that there's no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing
but other than that that's the only fall back you know because the winds change he goes the other direction and and we we have to follow him around you know [laughter]
yeah that's just Plano they have Plano festival
uh
let's see now i think we're on number eight or tenth we're almost to number ten i think because i've been here ten years
so yeah and then Mesquite is five they do one in Mesquite
now that's old that is that is the largest
yeah that's the largest one in the world they they have over six hundred balloons
um-hum [laughter]
about sixty it's it's getting larger last year i think we had eighty
um-hum more people get involved and stuff like that
but you have sponsored balloons you know like companies like Coors
uh
yeah Oldsmobile they all have balloons you know
the IBM had one last year now TI don't have one and Rockwell i mean yeah Rockwell they don't have one Rockwell whatever it is
none of the major electronic companies have them but uh like Southwestern Bell 7-Up they have balloons
yeah
yeah now banks they sponsor different banks out here like Bank One sponsored one one year
and i can't think of the rest of them but they they you know they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoever's sponsoring that ball- that balloon yeah it's pretty good
uh
oh yeah and it's so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree
and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome
and they filled it up the football field
and inflated all the balloons
and it's it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know [laughter] it was good it was fun i had fun
but that that's my that's probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books that's about it
do you really
romance [laughter]
uh um
um-hum
huh-uh
go anywhere yeah
uh uh
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
oh i seen that movie
yeah
really
i don't like i don't like scary books i ca- [laughter] i can't read those i get paranoid [laughter]
yeah she's one
but i like i i'm a Danielle Steele fan
yes
i have every book the woman's ever wrote [laughter]
and two of her books have been on three of them's been on TV
and i got all three of them on tape and i'm fixing to tape this other one that's coming on Monday
Chan- yeah
Changes
and i had the book and i hadn't read it in so long so i read it the other day to see if i could so i can watch the movie [laughter]
the book is always the book is always better
you know but you know but because i know some of the stuff like that one Judith Krantz made that one they did that one really they did okay but i liked the book better
it was good
um-hum
yeah
and you think it's the same but it's really not
um-hum
yeah the book was different from the
oh yeah
um-hum
so what else do you like to do besides r-
oh belly dance
you mean like those little thin in the little roll the bellies
i can't do that i've always tried to do that i've always wanted to though i didn't how people can get they stomach
um-hum
yeah
yeah right [laughter]
um
um
um
i like that
ae- yeah i like aerobics
in Dallas
no i go to jazzercise
[laughter]
oh really
oh they have them at night over here
um-hum
no we have six and seven no six and then one is at seven ten or something like that
um-hum
but i like jazzercise [laughter] i like it better than aerobics
because you're having fun
and
yeah i like jazzercise [laughter] i'll tell anybody i'd go to jazzercise before i'd go to aerobics [laughter]
yeah i used to belong i i but i stopped that because i never used it
you know the the fitness centers so [noise] oh well that's a waste of money
yeah i'm thinking about it my husband wants he wants to go t- and sign up for the weights
so but
um-hum and they're open till i think ten
yeah so
i don't know
um-hum
yep
oh yeah
um-hum
yep
my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah because i'm always looking at those guys i love them
but i always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair because [laughter] i've n-
yeah they do and i told him i said well if you do it you can't shave your hair
i'm sorry i can't handle it [laughter]
um-hum they do and then i don't know how they get because normally they're not that pumped up and i
yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list
oh we don't have capital punishment i believe you do
oh
yeah the the only thing about capital punishment is the i- i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state
he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back that's the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error
you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then you know if if there if you killed the person and it's like oops too bad
i mean i think i've heard of cases where someone did they uh the they were uh it was capital punishment they were killed
and they found out years later that the he really didn't kill the person
i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean
yes [vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise]
i'm the type of person who sits you know it's the same thing about the war i'm this type person you you know you need it
but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because
i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know
well uh like
yes but like you say there there's people out there that do such terrible things w- i had one of the subjects was uh crime
and it was talked about the the way society uh has worked out there's some people that economically trapped
and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because no one taught them
i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and
you're born with it you're
it's something that's taught it's something on the streets that you see so if it's a dog eat dog world
it it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment
but
i- i don't know how much of a deterrent it really is
you don't think it's a deterrent
so even though even though you don't think it's a deterrent which i have a tendency to -gree agree i mean it's a deterrent it's it's the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff
they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them i can see where it's not a deterrent
yes
does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live
wh- where you work
so is Dallas a bad city i talked to someone from San Antonio and and the Barrio she said it was very bad
Dallas
yeah
oh jeez
and that's relatively calm city
[laughter]
yes
oh it's very calm i mean you can [vocalized-noise] our uh bad district i wouldn't advise going walking in there alone at night but you could
and if anyone was bothering you you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though you're in the worst part of the city
um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're we're a really we're uh pampered up here
um and when they do have a crime a murder let's we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old um
raped and b- and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state
just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant
they didn't even re- they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant
that one of them says well i didn't realize that w- because i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like
although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it
it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen
i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something
and uh a home owner confronts him i mean it's not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running
i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out
i mean we're really fortunate to live here but
doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that
can't can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim
yes it's it's really sad
yes it's it's it's bad sometimes the kids have no choice because the parents are are worse
i mean it they'll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them
and they go they go to the gangs more or less for uh family oh this guys nice to me he doesn't hit me [laughter]
oh jeez
that's stupid
we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen
oh j-
yeah i know
oh
yeah w-
well then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to um institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i don't
it's it's so full of bullshit [laughter]
the the drug war is just t- you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the the military
that's true
yes we do
we we have uh the death by lethal uh by injection
[laughter]
wh-
i'm sure that
that that have to has happened but [noise] then there's also the um number of people who have
created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing
[noise]
and yet [vocalized-noise] although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again
[laughter]
but i didn't want to do it [laughter]
huh-uh
i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death
i- i- i would find that too difficult
um-hum
correct
something that's taught
um-hum
i don't think it's a deterrent at all i don't think that anyone that uh commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever
even uh be punished let alone put to death for it
i mean look at the mentality [laughter] of your average person who smokes cigarettes they don't think they're ever going to get cancer and yet it's written on every single package
most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law
right
right i think for probab- possibly the premeditated murders i think it's possibly a deterrent but
for the for the gang violence the uh the street murders so to speak i don't think it is
not where i live uh but i live outside of Dallas
the San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas Dallas does have um an area of town however the
young men i mean sixteen to nineteen year old boys [noise] are shot and killed or shot at least shot
frequently the uh the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here
handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day
i mean a day
[noise]
yeah it it obviously is not a DC you know
it it i understand that Vermont's relatively calm
um-hum
goodness
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah yes they're the they're the victims of neglect and
and uh many years of
of perpetuated
nonconcern for human life
yeah it's j- it's it's just a lack of concern they don't have you know these kids
the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for self-esteem and they find something like that in uh their gang activities
and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if they happen to know their parents
the other
yeah the uh the we were shocked two mornings ago with uh the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son
for forty dollars worth of crack
and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and he's three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market
i mean it can you that that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we
and it was just you know t- twenty miles from me [laughter]
but it's it's it's it's real strange uh it's it's a world that um
is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs
actually i think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs
not the kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better i'm talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill
they kill a lot
yeah
that's true
[noise]
uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers
okay
[laughter]
i see what team do you follow
i see
okay okay that's interesting
i guess really though i'm a native Texan so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the Rangers
and uh uh what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year
is that right
sort of a building seas- season yeah
shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll proba-
uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll perk up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but
yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio this morning that that uh
you know old Bobby Valentine said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell
that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh
right
yeah when [vocalized-noise] they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff uh
yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year
yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy
and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard
yeah
right and and that's really what the Rangers need some some consistency you know outer starter
and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting
uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year
so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them
that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off season and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year
right God he need to i mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball
but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros
yeah
yeah uh i don't know
is that right
well that's what it takes to uh because uh
right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader
and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to
because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader
right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah
yeah so it be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board
[laughter] and then he'll become an all star
[laughter]
that's right
that's exactly right
but uh
well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns out
i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh
go back
that's exactly right
yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a baseball player being worth that
[vocalized-noise] or any really any pro pro athlete because we look at that compared to what uh normal people make i mean it's just totally outrageous
and uh
yeah -at that that's what ticks me off about old uh Henderson you know wanting to rene- renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid player anymore
well man that's that's just ridiculous
right
exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it through the
right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and
right that's right
exactly and uh
you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but
and uh it really does irk me to see those guys out there uh you know making that much money
and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs
right
well that's right you can get your your fill just about
right
right right
so uh
oh really
oh yeah
oh jeez
golly
oh man that's ridiculous
[laughter]
oh man that makes it tough on the the whole club the management all the way down the rest players
yeah
right right
[noise]
well it will be interesting
i sort of am too uh i enjoy going out to a couple of the games and and uh
i really don't get that involved until the play-offs though uh
you know the season's just so long
right
that's right depending on what night it is and where they're at uh on whose playing
and uh
right
right right
well i tell you what i appreciate the conversation and uh we'll just have to watch and see how it goes comes about
all righty w-
we'll talk to you later bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh somewhat they're not my favorite team but uh yeah i am uh somewhat familiar with them
i follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly
basically be- because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid
okay
well uh
[laughter]
i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east
uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do
they traded for a lot of new players uh in in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future
yeah uh-huh
well there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia
[laughter] okay
they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him
yeah
yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh f- for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's one point six million dollars they can get a pretty good quality outfielder
yeah i'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch
but uh
i think the rest of the staff is uh a little weak
right
he's hot and cold
he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled
so [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
i see
i guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season
he claims to be out there to play ball
yeah they say he's really been hustling
never
yeah
well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh Robin Yount won the MVP instead of Sierra
the other year
but uh Yount has been a he's he's a player uh year in year out and always uh is leading the team in uh most of most of their offensive categories
he really is a team player
yeah
Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet
yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State
Juan Gonzalez
yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer
well given the Rangers' history they'll probably trade him
[laughter]
and then he'll
right somewhere else
that that seems to be the way the Rangers operate
how do you think Oakland's going to do
for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those guys uh
Canseco's making five million a year
yeah
yeah i i agree
i think it is and when when the players themselves are turning down contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million dollars a year looking for more money yet
sure
well it's it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck
because baseball
that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year
yeah and with what those guys get paid then they go out uh besides baseball and and advertise products or they they charge ten or fifteen dollars for a autograph
[laughter]
they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't making enough already as uh stars of the sport
yeah
sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of the year uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE [laughter]
yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV
especially to somebody like Nolan pitch
Brewers always have such hard luck Teddy Higuera is hurt again
he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando Valenzuela
and uh he had a torn rotator cup
so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said
but he may not pitch this season again
but he's the star of that uh team their pitching staff and when he sits out they fizzle
that seems typical because most of their other stars uh Paul Molitor's usually out half the season with injuries himself
yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh [vocalized-noise] more inexperienced players into those roles and they just don't have the leadership don't have the skills to carry a team
well i think it will be fun i'm ready for baseball season to start
yeah ah i agree with that
right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either
because the play- the teams uh usually play in split squads and they're either playing their rookies or their uh
uh
yeah
so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh [laughter]
i take it from there
okay well good luck to the Rangers this season [laughter] see if they can pull one out
all right sure thanks bye
[noise]
[noise]
well Bonny
how do you do your budget
uh-huh
yeah
utilities and stuff like that
yeah
uh-huh
huh
yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it
we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before
and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money
and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills
uh
i wish we could do that unfortunately
between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good
oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh three thousand dollars a year for child support
which is after i mean that's net that's that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it
yeah
that's what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff
yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my wife takes some of hers
and we have an agreement that uh if we're going to charge anything over like seventy five or eighty dollars then [vocalized-noise] we uh we talk about it
unless of course it's uh it's like for a present or whatever
and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here
yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my wife wanted
she really wanted a little small five inch TV she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever she's watching television
and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money
and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there
i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water
and sure enough we got it
uh-huh
yeah
how how do you d- uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
he's got a stable schedule then
everything kind of works out well
yeah if if if you don't have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take five or ten dollars here
oh
oh yeah
uh-huh Tex Tower yeah
that's good
that's not too bad
that that's cutting it pretty close though
well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now
not too much you can do about it
between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does
oh yeah so do we
uh-huh
yeah they want their money real quick
that's the only bad part we got the same problem
however i guess it uh beats the alternative
just not having anything to start out with
oh yeah
well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it
well you know kids are important you got s- you have to stay home with the kids
well soon as they get in to school it won't it won't be so bad
well Bonny
i- it sounds like a pretty good idea
tell you what uh i think we about done our about five minutes
okay we'll check you later
bye-bye
[noise]
yeah
well
we take the rent first
you know we need to have a roof over our head
and then we take the car
you know we need a car to get back and forth to work
and then it's the utilities
and then the food
uh
and then uh the regular bills
you know your credit cards and your uh
yeah
uh
i i'm trying to think what else phone the pho- utilities come last or uh before let's see the utilities come before the food and the bills
the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans
things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else
they're last on it because you know uh they
they're never late but they're the least uh b- bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else
yeah
yeah
yeah well i'm a homemaker myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it
should be and
or the way whatever way we can
i can imagine i uh you know i haven't gone through a divorce myself i've only been married once but uh
i know a lot of people that have and a lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that
yeah i bet
[vocalized-noise]
well that's better than having them living with you
[laughter] they're more expensive right there day in and day out
yeah i bet you do
yeah oh well me and my hu-
yeah
[laughter] i love it when my husband decides to to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in
i've got one of them
yeah
[noise] well uh my mother-in-law gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i don't think it's five inches i think it's a little bit bigger than that
but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity
so it's a neat little thing to have
uh well they ha- we have direct deposit that helps a lot
uh and uh
first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead
and uh you know he makes the same amount every week
uh he's not it's not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's
uh you know that's extra uh but
he's got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month
and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh
it works out real well uh
most problem we had was when uh
let's see when was it
something like we had a three p- uh weekends
uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period
and uh we was close to being uh
oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh
it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away
uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff
and so that was pretty bad but
i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard
yeah
yeah pretty much uh
with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand
oh well he's he's we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work
and that's hard you know uh i'm sure you're [vocalized-noise] familiar with TI up here
and you know how they got the Tex- uh that Texans Credit Union
right there he uh
he's good at uh getting into that but he's g- he's you know we never in my i- i've been married to him for seven years and we've never had a check bounce
and uh well no i take that back one time we did uh
it didn't bounce but it came close we called our landlord and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for three days [laughter] we was overdrawn six dollars
so
yeah
[noise] but uh it was i don't know we've never he we've had problems meeting our bills before but uh we've met them
yeah that's what's going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt
and yeah that's taking money that we didn't have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or two and we're trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by April
yeah
yeah
well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know
and uh i'm we're up to where
close to where we want to be but we're not quite there yet
yeah i just c- i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job
but then
i'd rather be with my kids
yeah well you know i've got a two year old and a four year old and uh
yeah but i know it would help with the bills
yeah
okay well it was nice talking to you
all right bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i guess i'm maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war
uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable but uh
i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you
yes
uh-huh
right
[noise]
right
[noise]
yeah
right
right
right
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i guess there was concern uh that I- Iraq would use
you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen i mean why not
uh-huh
oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the
[noise]
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right i don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet
[laughter] i think that's that's that's not very likely
but yet you know as as the parallel with Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that
uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right right
okay well thanks bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat
[noise] there you go
well i think h- have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four
okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other
right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US d- during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them
because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country
and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right
and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself
like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lith- in Lithuania
they they were announced to be a separate country
but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people
you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border
right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries
you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people
you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there
but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere
and the US has
you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering
you know but i think i think the thing is is that
there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button
but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it
because they got too much at stake
yeah
well
my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used
that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot
right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him
i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know
but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right
we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know
uh no
no
yeah
right
right
and uh you know there's there's just
you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die
you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know
but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous
you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but
it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know
yeah
yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so
and keep his power but well
no i i don't think so i think uh and they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia
would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that
they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete
so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know
they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do
so oh well i got to go to class now
nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it
you don't
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
yeah
right
yeah i a- i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America
and also the um [noise] i don't know it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations
because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably
you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on [laughter] i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just
yeah
um-hum
right
there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is
but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated
and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population
they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and
you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and men- mental acuity
yeah
yeah
um-hum
right
yeah
yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them right now
i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like [noise] i mean come on let's take the pressure off
yeah and it's just like another thing the American family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their green bean water in cups and leave them alone
i don't know
yeah
uh-huh that's
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
and and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think
right it is because it is another language yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
that's funny well that's good -ll i think we kept it at real good
[laughter]
is that all we need to say
you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean
and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something tot- income tax or something and i just
anyway the i appreciate it have a good day
[noise]
okay [noise]
no i don't like the metric system
i- i- i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system
it it's gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand
um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and
it's it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the English system
[noise]
and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is
yeah
[laughter]
i mea- it's [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
yeah
[noise]
and it's easy to trans- we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done
because i'm a mechanical engineer and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard
and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every
[noise]
measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds
really
yeah
absolutely
oh yeah it's just
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools
and they do i know now because i even when i was in elementary school [laughter] years ago they were
you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that
and and that's acceptable
because
yeah
really
ye- [laughter]
you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter] and it it just doesn't yeah it doesn't make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it's needed
you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh w- if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world
it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us
that's kind of the way i feel about it we can convert
yeah it it's kind of like e- expecting everyone to suddenly speak German
you know
yeah and and [vocalized-noise] instead of having the world speak German we found out that we can translate and that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system
okay
yeah i -'s been nice talking to you
okay
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] all right
-ell good talking to you
bye bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay so uh then do you keep kids is this two year old yours or do you keep children for other people
oh that's exactly what i have yes
i know i my my little girl was three and a half in March and my son was two in January
that's pretty close
yeah
yes it is have you been able to do that all along or
yeah
oh how neat
how old were they when you adopted
so he probably doesn't remember
oh yeah definitely needed well that's that's pretty interesting well i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids you know that was always my dream you know i wasn't necessarily a career person
but as long as i was single and had to work i was going to get a good job and do the best i could and my husband was in the type of business that you know it's insurance so you have to build a clientele and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit
and so i haven't been able to quit yet so i've had to deal a lot with child care and course we're hoping within hopefully the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home
but um i started out um my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born until she went to work last year in August and it worked out pretty good you know we had always said from the beginning that
if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them somewhere else you know the friendship is more important
[noise] and uh it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them you know she loved them like they were hers and i- i knew you know i had good peace of mind i knew that they were taken care of and
yeah
uh-huh
yes
huh
and she had no help
she had no help she was alone with them
[noise] oh that is hard
yeah
gee
i don't either [laughter]
so
yeah
you have to let them have some wild time if that's considered wild [laughter]
yeah
right
right
yes
yeah
well when when my friend decided to go back to work and whenever we had problems it worked out okay because she would come and tell me and we'd work it out
after that i found another girl that had gone to church with us that you know they needed it financially she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy and i thought well you know we'll try her but she came to our house and that just did not work
uh i mean she loved the kids and she was good with them but
uh you know they were filthy when i'd get home now i understand kids go out and play and they get dirty but i mean filthy i'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair and the and i was like gosh and then
you know my own furniture and stuff was like you know the kitchen table the i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs and the and clean and i was like
yeah and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a Friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of Monday morning
well you know i work eight to five thirty so what am i supposed to do
so i well i had been sick and i it ended up that i didn't go to work Monday because i was sick so i stayed home with them and we went to some of the KinderCares
yeah well that's what they said there were two pretty near our house and they said well bring them in this week for a free day so i lined up someone Tuesday they had a Mother's Day Out that my babysitter took them to you know which was fine they liked it they'd been going to it for years
and so i stayed with them Monday Tuesday they went to that Wednesday i took them to one Kindercare Thursday i took them to another KinderCare and then on Friday my husband and i split but on Thursday i didn't like the KinderCare's they
they didn't give him
oh
oh that's horrible
and doing something with him well not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month which i didn't have [laughter] you know i didn't i you know we're we're a Christian family and you know they because they're you know
like public they're not private you know they can't pray they can't talk about God they can't do anything like that and i don't want them indoctrinated you know but i'd like them to be able to say gee God made the flowers you know and things like that
yeah yeah basic so um i talked to another l-
lady at church it was like Thursday of that week and she said oh i found the most wonderful place that i've been taking my daughter and i've know this girl i went to college with her so i really i you i- i value her opinion
and she told me about a private one it it was associated with one of the churches here it's not the church i go to but it's you know it it was Lubbock View Christian Church and it's a private academy
and so i went over there and i talked to the lady well they have like a three year waiting list but she said i had a mother tell me that she may take a job in San Antonio and she has a three year old and a toddler which mine was at the time
and she said i should know something by tomorrow which is Friday and she said if she leaves she said i'll let you have her spot
and so Friday afternoon at five thirty she called me and she said she's going you can bring your kids Monday [noise]
i know i was just like God set this up for me he knew i needed this and uh [noise] so since October then they've been going there and
i- i love it i have been at such peace with myself it's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles and
the cost was not near as much as the KinderCares were going to be did you hear my printer in the background i'm sorry i hope you can understand what i'm s- so yeah yeah i was only about twenty dollars more a month than i was paying because
being a private institution they're nonprofit
so they don't have to charge as much and the hours are wonderful and i just i think it's the best thing i told Russ yest- that we should have done this a long time ago
you know [laughter] It's great So i guess as long as i have to work i feel good that they're there they're getting the love the care They have a little curriculum They teach them
you know the alphabet the numbers the things which you know if they learn they learn If they don't they don't i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three but it's kind of neat when they come home with it you know and
uh
yeah
oh and the teachers love [vocalized-noise] Taylor got bit several times and Taylor bit several times and the teachers dealt with that we're like hey they're two and we keep them apart and we scold them and we correct them and you know they mark it all down and they let you know and
and you know they get over it real quick and he doesn't do it anymore and
they work at the potty train- i just just so mu- i don't know i just feel like a big burden was lifted [laughter] so
it is
i know
i know and that's hard
yeah [noise] well and it it you know but i understa- i i i wish you could find a good Mother's Day Out because that would be good for your peace of mind also
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah and that's usually like you know i don't know when mine were going to Mother's Day Out it was like from nine to three so that was a pretty good pretty good time you know my babysitter would take them and then pick them up
so that worked out real good
well i'm tickled to death i hope you find something and it was good talking to you
well i guess it said child care criteria and i think we both listed it and experiences [laughter]
and you too bye
[noise]
[noise]
no i have two children i have a two year old and a three and a half year old
really that's wild
[laughter]
oh boy well mine was two in March and the three and a half year old will be four in in July
so that is pretty close
but i'm home with the kids all day and i have really um
tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us
but
pretty much pretty much uh i work part-time but uh my husband's able you know mostly to take care of them when i'm working so uh but we adopted these two little guys and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because you know they have had a
couple foster homes already
the baby was eleven weeks old and his brother was twenty twenty two months
yeah so
um-hum
yeah
yeah
oh boy
yeah
oh that's mean
yeah yeah
yeah
that's the hardest thing i think you know to to deal with is that people love your kids i put um
my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of two mornings a week of being with other kids and starting to learn some taking turns and you know that kind of thing and uh he was in there for three months when i pulled him out
and the the teacher had eleven kids it was excellent supposedly the reputation was fantastic for this place was supposed to be an excellent school and i had several friends who had had recommended it too but it really gets down to the particular teacher
and she was a new teacher at the school and she had eleven you know three year olds in a room and i just think it was way too much they were almost all boys
pardon
i didn't think much i don't think much
yeah and she was just my uh three year old is real active and she just kept saying how wild he was well you know there was kind of a connotation there of him being
you know it being a problem like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said well you know at three years old i don't find that to be a behavioral problem you know [laughter] i mean it's kind of like she was
there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more and it's really hard to con- you can't control eleven three year olds with one person you know yeah you know
so i just finally took him out plus financial reasons it was expensive but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time but i still felt like even after all the checking i did
you know you really can't know everything about what's going to happen i felt safe that
the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them you know because there was enough classrooms close together that it was like a house with different classrooms and i felt like
that was a big factor for me that they would would be safe you know from any kind of abuse or that kind of thing
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh gosh
so you had to come home and clean before you could even do anything probably
oh gosh
yeah
oh yeah i was i took the kids there once just to try it they had a free day at Kindercare yeah
uh-hum
[laughter]
i didn't either i had one bad [vocalized-noise] i had two bad experiences just that one day with medicine that my son was supposed to have for a cold that they never gave him
and the other one was that the the younger one got bit
really badly by another child and what they did was they took my
younger one out and put him in a crib and left him in a crib the rest of the day
instead of taking the kid that was biting out and do something with him yeah
yeah
yeah
so you feel like your values aren't getting yeah yeah
yeah yeah God loves you you know basic things like that
yeah
um-hum
yeah
wow
oh what luck
really
oh that's great
yeah
oh really wow
that's okay i got the dryer going in the background so
yeah
oh that's great
yeah
yeah yeah
at least they think it's fun it's not a big you know trauma to them to learn something [noise] yeah
yeah
really because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i can't do anything with them here i can't even go grocery shopping right now with the two of them because the baby is so
into everything and the older brother is you know running around all over the place so it is a [vocalized-noise] yeah yeah
yeah i need to even just for a couple days a mornings a week or something to have something like that so i- i think i'm going to look for that remind me of that now that you mention it i was been meaning to do that you know
because some of the churches do have them um you know for like six dollars per child and that's not that big a deal you know for a couple times
yeah
yeah
yep
sounds good yeah
well thanks did we cover everything we need
[laughter]
okay
okay
yeah okay well great well thanks a lot you have a good day bye-bye
[noise]
well that should be interesting
okay you ready
here we go
[noise]
[noise] what kind of car did you buy Ralph
a Mazda how come you got a Mazda
oh
you couldn't couldn't find an American built car
huh
i'll be darned
i've had pretty much the i've had pretty much the opposite experience
yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab
it didn't last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that
yeah i that's that's probably true i'm getting ready to i think i'm going to trade off the super cab and i'm considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep
but i can't decide which one
yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot
but i don't need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now
but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me
especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas
well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i'm going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don't really i i haven't had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth
they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the positrack rear end instead of the four wheel drive
he's getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road
no he's not really and he's not he said he's pretty heavy footed he's clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it
so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage
it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit i just don't know if i could stand one that small because i'm fairly large and i've always driven a truck or something
i don't know
they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife's got uh three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought
she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven
and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it's like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i've got to have something fairly large
but i think prob- probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability
you know the little those smaller trucks
yeah i know that's
i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it
but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs
you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine
last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars
so i don't know
how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know
you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city
um well watch it coming down south down when you get through uh round round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a highway patrol that just patrols up and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs
he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there
Georgetown Georgetown or [noise] Georgetown
on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area now that's a neat little car
those little five little five point oh Mustangs the fast ones
oh yeah
you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper
it's probably more functional
i don't think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months
but God it was miserable during the winter i don't care what they say
yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i don't know what they are now probably eigh- probably eight hundred by now
if you ever roll one that's pretty much it
you know that
that that that and the windshield post doesn't stop much
um
you don't give those they don't give those BMWs away
those are expensive machines
um
well think we about done our five minutes
okay [noise]
good talking to you
see you later bye bye
[noise]
yeah i just bought one so
yeah guess so
uh Mazda
uh price basically
price and uh what it
all the things it came with for the price i couldn't beat it
uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars
just not holding up so
uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so [laughter]
i just [noise] decided to go foreign
really
really
hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck
they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart
get out there and test drive
yeah
right
i don't know how much going to
how much better you're going to get with a Blazer there
really
oh that's not so bad then
right
yeah i don't know i haven't been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh
yeah yeah
durability yeah if you got to take it out in the field
yeah they show them jumping over those ramps but hey
yeah
right
oh about uh twenty six twenty seven in the city it's a it's a four cylinder
and it's kind of a
sports coupe guess a little sports car but
i- it does pretty good
huh
yeah i haven't even had a chance i've only had it for about three months i haven't had a chance to take it out on the road
i'll probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when school's out
i'll have to keep that in mind because uh
Roundrock and where
Georgetown
oh uh
yeah i i wanted to get a Mustang i wanted to get a convertible but the convertibles you know they tack on an extra five six grand
and it's like i can't see paying that for a
for just
being able to take the roof down
yeah
yeah it's like i got and plus the way crime is going around here in the city you know take a knife to it break in
yeah i'm sure they're
yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because
insurance
yeah
i had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago it was a BMW totaled the car he walked out of it though
all right i got a meeting to get to so
great
bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay what is your uh general opinion then of of taxes for the Americans
yeah
um-hum
right yeah uh
as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not
they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes
either that or uh starting a state income tax
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
almost full value right yeah
yeah
um-hum
right
right
[laughter]
yeah guess that's a possibility
uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right
oh okay so
okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes
okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return
okay so so you couldn't deduct state inco- uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas
so what do you think about the difference between those two situations
um-hum
yeah
right
yeah [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah that's that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess [laughter] in a sense
i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to
pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that
but uh you know i understand what you're where you're coming from with the
yeah
yeah
um-hum
right
[laughter]
yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is we're we're talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people
maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs
if uh you know if we're going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh
you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments
because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to
to uh
not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and
all that you're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get
and uh
the more you have the more uh aid for dependent children you can get and all of these things go into it so
but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so
right
right it uh
right
yeah right i- i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect
uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that don't have anything get it for nothing
and uh and i don't think that's the American way myself it uh
it kind of rings of you know socialism and
and i just i don't understand why
the American leaders uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that
uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for
or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to
um
i don't think that i'm paying too many tax you know too much tax myself
uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax
uh it's quite a bit different than uh Texas i don't know if you've ever been outside of Texas but uh
when i moved to Texas i was told oh well there's no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then that's how they get their money to take care of the schools and things
yeah i- i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because it was the best because it had more money than you know other places
and uh i just um
in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there [laughter] and um
the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house
so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about
[noise] ninety or a hundred thousand dollars
whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price
and so there was quite a difference there
um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh
crazy i think if if they uh people and and i'll use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling
and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue we're going to have to raise the price uh you know we're going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house
and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes
then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so
they were shooting themselves in the foot
and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we don't you know if we put a freeze on new home starts
that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here
no no they do have state income tax
yeah that's and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties
that is correct
um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine
no
um
in Texas i was oh i believe the uh t- sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent
here in Maryland it's only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available
uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um
i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh
maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes
you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else
and the the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are
probably more able to pay the income tax
uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um
there wa- there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay
and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services
you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense
um-hum
yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what we're paying for um
for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level
and uh hopefully we'll
you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it
um i haven't kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight
but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland who's uh pretty hard nosed and uh he's you know we're three hundred fifty million dollars short
and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling
and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they won't let him raise the taxes and and they they won't let him cut any programs and he's like what do you guys want me to do
i mean
um-hum
yes
yeah
yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year
um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own
and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government
and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way
and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah there there's uh you know once you reach a certain plateau in in finances um
[noise]
[noise]
my children are thirty three twenty nine and twenty five
and i uh am spending more time with my twenty five year old because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while he's trying to uh
find a nice girl and get married [laughter] they're little right right they're a little hard to come by so anyway he's still here uh
the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my sons-in-law seem to be so much more involved than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group
oh how wonderful we had uh an October baby on the fifteenth May [vocalized-noise]
[noise]
yeah [laughter] well my husband's is on the fourteenth so we did miss that one day by a few hours there but we didn't care at that point so
so do you find your husband more involved than your father was with you
um
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
Christianity doesn't hurt us any does it [laughter]
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh and perhaps Emily will when she's a little older
uh-huh uh how do you find uh with an alcoholic father how do you f- ho- what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic
and at fifty she and she was an only child
at fifty she's st- still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father
and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her father was alcoholic over which of course she had no control
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh and you don't feel that your relationship with your father has unduly uh influenced your relationship with your husband then
um
uh
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
you didn't need to get away from home then
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
my fa- my husband was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home
and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasn't that he was
neglectful of his children by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty uh
[vocalized-noise] you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted them
he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh he's very ex- he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own
so he has overcome alcoholism at this point
oh
um-hum
oh
but he said it
uh-huh
yeah
the first time i heard my older daughter tell and she is our most expressive tell my husband that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so
so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him
his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband
uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and
we have two daughters and a son and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and
as i say our our sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to their children and i wonder if it's because they're there when they de- they're delivered if that
right if that maybe starts in the delivery room with a chain that my generation missed out on
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh or a mother some of them the fathers are raising the children
it's certainly not a good situation but i'm sure it's not one that the the the families chose i mean i'm sure they felt they had no choice at our stage in life we've seen
a lot of our friends go through divorces uh you know we've been married thirty five years and so that's how old our friends are
and they're on their second marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their children i just
you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you kn- we stayed together and at this point our children are saying gosh i'm glad you did that
so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least
um-hum and they see that with my husband's retirement a little over a year ago we're having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and and uh and that way i think we're doing a lot for our grandchildren
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
do you have children
okay [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
that's a hard process isn't it [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October
uh-huh
oh really
yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah at it's that close
yeah
i he definitely i had an unusual situation w- in my home my father was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more involved and we have more of a
uh i guess a Christian based home and so we try to make the family as important as we can
and uh
uh and i guess you don't have to have a Christian based home to to feel that way but that's just part of our priorities that's right [laughter] it certainly gives you some some spec- specific goals to work towards but uh
he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and
and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily
but if he forgets i try to to help him remember
i think so
[noise]
i think uh i've been reading a lot lately about the alcohol children of alcoholics syndrome i don't know if you've heard of that or not
but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong Christian background personally it affected me differently than it affected my sisters and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger
as i see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things and uh
as far as me personally i think
it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesn't do certain things that my dad did so i
uh-huh
uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily
because i don't want to my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in
and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that
she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we don't want to control her
and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions
and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her
um i i look at myself and i have three sisters there's four daughters in the family i look at myself compared to my sisters' families
and see that one of them married an abusive husband one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship
and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh
[noise]
um
well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like
if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no
no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah i see my father relating much better to the grandchildren than he did to us
[noise]
not completely no he he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages
but he still you know he will pick up my one of my granddaughters and say you know give her a hug and say i love you and the first time he said i love you to me was when i had been away from home for almost a year and a half
yeah it i said i love you dad i miss you and then he said was able to say it back and and i was twenty four and that's the first time i'd heard him say anything you know similar to that
[noise]
um
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
they went through that entire process yeah
uh-huh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where i'm not working now i didn't work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born
and but so many women are having children and returning to the work field that the the dads
you know have to to follow through or a third person has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more
and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing it's not breaking at any point
at least it shouldn't and and and and in a good family it isn't unfortunately there's so many families where there isn't a father in the home it's just yeah that's right yeah
[noise] yeah so
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah they see you go through the problems and still come out okay working together
uh-huh
yes yeah well that sounds good my background is in sociology and so i see a lot of unwed mothers
[noise]
uh
i've only purchased one new car in my entire life
right
and that was back in nineteen fifty nine
and it was a new Ford
so the automobiles that that i have uh
first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun
and we've been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years
and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it
so [laughter]
yeah and uh we've got we've got a sixty seven Mustang that we bought brand new
and we still have that
so yeah it's going to be uh let's see next year i guess it will be an antique
yeah
but the problem with it is up here around there's so much salt on the roads
that it's hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and
yeah uh every once in a while though uh i'll read a blip where you guys get some
uh terrible ice storms
but they don't put salt on the roads down there then
ugh okay
nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will
[noise]
okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile
oh okay
yeah
yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the
you can't drive a standard
yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger
you know but i've it's been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and that's it i don't like any of that
but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we've got Pontiacs
uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if it's tuned up or not we get between eighteen and twenty two miles to the gallon uh
you know it's not really all that that doesn't it's it isn't as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles
you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess
uh
yeah that's i i had a pickup truck in fact i had i had two the last one i gave to my uh uh youngest
uh
because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove
so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so
every winter we- i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around
but now everything's done so
i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order wood but
uh
[noise]
uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority
it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air
so down down where you guys are
it's a necessity yeah
yeah that's i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago
uh on a seminar for a week
and that's when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six
eighties and you know when i left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and
[vocalized-noise]
so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now
it gets warm enough down there for it
so
yeah
oh are you
so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic
uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that
uh
so you got a yeah
yeah
so if you know if you know where where you're get getting your your automobile from
it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent
it's eight percent down there
s- who
so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with
and then we have an excise tax up here too i don't know if you have one every year down there
so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is
and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes it's terrible
and in our town we live in a like a rural area
and they have a fire tax that they add on too
so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes
sounds like you got a a little one there
oh
so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax that's it they don't tax you on it anymore
so that's what they consider property tax it's like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax
[noise]
yeah
i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too
it's like that Mustang that we have
the excise tax on it every year there's a minimum you have to pay and and it's only twelve dollars
so we've got an automobile that's that's got some class to it but i don't really i can't tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it
because they all look the same
yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get
uh some good mileage out of it
because of the the i'm driving a Pontiac now
and it's uh it's a sixty seven Pontiac it's got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it
[noise]
and it's absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and
i take it back and forth to work
and then my wife's got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac
and that's a big car it's a V8 four door
and that's got uh
a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too
so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now i'll end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and
so we we just been doing it for years and years and years
that's incredible
yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and and you don't really know where it came from
then you're buying somebody's headaches probably
it's yeah and there's no warranty
so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it
unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one
[noise]
okay uh
are you in the market for a new car [laughter]
really [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
w- well that's great
if you if you can find a deal like that
oh
oh that that that's a classic car
next year [laughter]
oh really
huh
i bet that's right i bet that i bet that is true
for dow- well down here we don't have that problem
of course
[laughter]
oh yes we get and then
[laughter] they sand the roads
and it just turns into a big mess
[laughter]
so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it's like a big huge fender bender parking lot
so i just tr-
nobody goes anywhere [laughter]
well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn't n- it wasn't new it was a a a an Astro van and
we really like it because we got uh a two year old and another one on the way
so uh
we [laughter] we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and [laughter] stuff with that [laughter] so we got rid of that and
we're really pleased with it
yes i can't drive a standard [laughter]
[laughter] no i can't drive a standard [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
that's good we
uh oh yeah but yeah uh that's not one of my first priorities when i'm looking for a new car is excellent gas mileage
look
well my husband has to have a has to drive a pick up so that's so he has his he has a pickup [laughter]
uh he drives a small uh S GMC S fifteen [noise] which we bought we bought new five years ago and have had real good luck with i mean there's have absolutely no trouble with it [noise]
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
hum
oh yes
down here it's a it's it's it's a necessity
when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half [laughter]
it's
oh yeah
yeah it was it's pretty warm
uh-huh
[laughter]
so it's a shock
yeah i've i've in the car i've been running it
uh uh uh uh because it
but uh the the wea- the weather's just been really nice but i mean you you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air conditioning in it
like we're from Missouri and when we moved
we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was it [laughter] that's when we traded it [laughter]
yes
oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh
from an es- it was an estate t- uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died
so we got a really good deal
and it's loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new [noise] there's no way i could have afforded it
but uh since it was a state vehicle [noise] we got a really good deal on it but it
yeah
oh it's it's eight p- it's eight here
y- yes
yes it is i-
oh no
oh how awful
oh how awful
oh she hit her she hit her head [laughter] now she's fine so
[vocalized-noise]
oh uh property tax the city of Dallas but uh since we moved out of the city of Dallas we don't have to pay property tax on it anymore
right homes vehicles you know everything
ha- everything like that gets uh taxed pro- uh property tax
even if you you know if you don't own it yet i- if you're paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it
uh-huh
yeah
yes everything loo- that's i- i don't i don't foresee b- us buying an a a vehicle anytime in the near future because we're very pleased with what we've got plus i don't like anything that they've come out with
oh yeah
ooh wee [laughter]
well that's great that
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that that's great you got a hold of a couple of ve- uh really good vehicles
yeah
well down here if you want to go buy a used car it's impossible because they want just as much for a used car as they want for a new car
and it it it just does
it just doesn't make sense to buy a used car down here
yeah
oh you have no idea where it comes from you d-
no none
yes true
yeah
[noise]
there we go
[noise] i think that's true
the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up
uh in in March it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April so
so i think we're a little -head uh ahead of schedule on that
that's true it's been a [noise] a fun break but it the break is over
yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny
well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so
yeah
yeah
[noise] i hadn't heard whether it's gonna rain or not
well that's good
yeah that's probably a [vocalized-noise] a little bit under what it is for this time of year i- i think i haven't seen the weath- the n- the weather
on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy
yeah
yeah that's true
um
[noise] one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high
of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high
and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable
that it doesn't vary very much
y- i mean any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold
uh-huh
right
right
yeah [noise] one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year
[noise] was a twenty six degree lightning storm
[noise] i you know i was going into the grocery store and a [noise] a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out
and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature
that's right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high
sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that
twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing
the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees
because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away
nope
[noise] yep i i'm really enjoying this now
[noise] well this has been interesting
n- not too challenging to the brain
nope
[noise] all right Ellen well you have a good day
bye-bye
[noise]
yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year
yeah
yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon [laughter]
[noise] yeah [noise] well um oh i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray you know just
yeah
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray [laughter]
oh i go for that yeah
in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side
[noise] i think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest'll be
without rain
[noise] but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties
that's getting back to a little bit chillier
yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right
[noise] well i like it when it's sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there i- i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm
i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature
hm
yeah you're probably right
yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on TV and i think it was one day this week a year ago
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time
oh wow
hm
yeah that that is pretty unusual
and you really take notice of it too uh
hm
wow
yeah i don't don't like that super cold stuff
i just don't move very well when it's that cold
[noise] yeah well
[laughter] not not a real in depth topic but [noise] enjoyed talking to you
o- okay good-bye
[noise]
[noise]
are you a player
is it
um
yeah
yeah i ha- i haven't played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset
but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits
i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i
hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i
i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap's twenty i-
i like the
really
yeah i've tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day she's
she's ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i'm a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i- you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and
it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really
and i you know i walk i don't ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so
yeah
right
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed
you know here it is sixty five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there so
but i uh [vocalized-noise] picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it
and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my clubs but i haven't swung them in quite a few years
and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there [laughter]
you know i really enjoy it it's really nice
yeah
yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but
no
and then you know we've got some guys here they're you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them so
you know but [vocalized-noise] get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time
and i've you know i've never [vocalized-noise] never yet have i walked up now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their
twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me tea- tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or
you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports
right
yeah
yeah you need to
yeah
oh yeah we [vocalized-noise] we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because it doesn't get dark -til nine thirty or ten
and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start well when we we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess
and it'll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were
you know now they're down into the hundreds [vocalized-noise] nineties so it won't take her long
you know
and it's something we can do together so
well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
all right
yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't [vocalized-noise] like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right
so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all
yeah
yeah
and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway
now you know the ball'll go straight and i go [noise] i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so
and
well i enjoyed talking to you
i guess i'll go back to work
all right see you later bud bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
uh i'd like to think i am it's it's been a while now [laughter]
yeah i've uh
oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose
yeah
[laughter]
yeah yeah
right
right
yeah
that's that's great yeah
no it's uh i could say it's been a while for me too i uh i've got my wife motivated about it um
and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in
really
well great great that's good
yeah same thing here
right right
um-hum yeah
that's i've got the same attitude i uh
i tell you i- i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college
and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school and
since then uh we've made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday
or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding
and uh so it that's back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh
eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i'll show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home
yeah
yep yep
oh -kay
yeah
yeah that's right
oh it i- it's it's a lot of fun e- especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that- that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or
racquetball
right and and people don't want to play with somebody that they're going to beat every time you know and and uh and
um-hum
right
that's right yeah
that's true
that's true
well
that that that's uh
yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you
y- you know you you get s- you get in a rut i- if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh
you know you've basically tapped your resources there
but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to w- work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that
um-hum
right
uh-huh
sure
right
well that's good that's good that sounds like a lot of fun
yeah
yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh
um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh k- kind of the same situation she s- she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but
she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh
it's uh that's interesting though
um-hum
that's right
um-hum
that's right well yeah that's i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know i- if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh
out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and
i keep i keep rationalizing [vocalized-noise] well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and
it it it really works that way [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
yeah
sure
sure
yeah that's great
well you bet
okay sounds like it
okay bye
[noise]
hi how you doing
do you [noise] do you have uh drug testing where you are
uh-huh
uh yeah i have uh what i've found out out of curiosity was my name has uh has come up twice and we've only been involved with the program say about a year
and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing
because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me
yeah but now um now that it's happening i
i feel comfortable with it i- i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works
around me um
is is drug free
how how about how about where y-
um-hum
well i was involved in uh in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people
what we were doing why we were doing it so i- i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of
of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh
uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs
oh yeah
how do you feel about oth- other uh things like public uh safety buses bus drivers and and uh airplane drivers or or
pilots rather
you
yeah
yeah
well i
um
yeah the the uh i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i h- never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was
whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well-being
no so i had uh
right
well i'm sure that's still going to happen [laughter]
um you know i've gone to those classes uh unfortunately for me i'm i'm a smoker and um i- i saw the statistics that came out on
uh smokers typically have more time out of work they're uh uh more prone to accidents and all of those other things and and uh
for for automobile insurance i had no idea
that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about uh health
uh-huh
you're not as attentive
um
uh that's uh that's different i've never heard of that how about the um
the the smoking premium
out in Texas i understand they they started doing that
June July
yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites
yeah
well that's that's the problem that's you don't uh how about uh do you ea- do you like French fries
[laughter] wh- what would you what would you ever say if they said anybody who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance
uh then you would get upset it's it's uh what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece
and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um
preventable death not yeah but
yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross
so they're not only saying pre- not preventable death they're also saying um
that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke
uh-huh
[laughter]
is he an older person
well that
that's not too old
[laughter]
yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
well
wh- what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already
hardening of the arteries it's it's uh sure it is [laughter] high cholesterol
[laughter]
s- see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you it's the ca- it's the capability of detecting it
how do you prove someone has eaten French fries [laughter]
[laughter]
um but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it
yeah yeah
uh
but yeah but there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it
and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a a change in in policy about drinking until
[laughter] ye- yeah right right yeah
so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where it's not so- i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily
i know i am um i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that that i'm doing it because i want to i
well i- i- i do i do make that statement i say i do it because i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because i want to i'm doing it because i have to uh or be- my desire is greater than uh
[laughter]
uh-huh
start up again
i uh i started when i was younger and uh
it was prior to the time that the the risks were uh were known
okay nice talking to you
[laughter] and you've got that Southern accent [laughter]
[laughter]
i'm in the Att-
Attleboro Massachusetts plant
yeah
oh no kidding
good
[laughter]
yes yes we do right here at the at the very building they have uh a nurse's office
and uh i haven't
my name hasn't come up yet how about you
right
right
yes that's [noise] the the major issue i guess that uh
i have a a similar opinion at first i
wasn't sure
but
then
i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well
uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who [vocalized-noise] wro- one who wrote a huge letter to the editors
saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and
but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't re- you know
i'm i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to uh
to make a mistake
right
right
who were uh
right and that and that's a lot of money [laughter]
and
oh oh taking drug testing
oh sure i think that's that's
i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights
to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying
uh when the public whole ah is at stake
then i'm willing to gi- you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know
if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right
because i can see that it's uh
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and
you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money
as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and and everything else in this country
right
right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but
and um they don't have any of that up here but you know um
i guess it's just the productivity
and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess
and that they uh
that they accrue
right well well i- i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work
and then i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too
[laughter]
when they're dri- and that's why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well
yeah
oh yeah
they
non-
at least down here in Texas they have non-
nonsmoker they call them discounts
they give you if you're a nonsmoker i- i guess there is some kind of studies that show
but if you're smoking
you're not you're not as you know [vocalized-noise] when you're lighting up or something you know your hands both hands aren't on the wheel or whatever
that's yeah i guess that takes effect in uh
when June July yeah
right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself
i do [laughter]
yeah i'd probably get upset
yeah yeah
right right
right
right
right if they i- i- i assume if they they
i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one
leading cause of preventable
preventable
death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related
right right right [vocalized-noise] right well that's all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs
and we do have one smoker in our area who and he
he seems to miss a lot of work
but um
um forty
eight maybe
yeah forty five forty eight
yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average
not specific cases and uh
i thought well with you know if that's really true then
then i guess i agreed with the extra premium
if it cou- i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries
were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess
yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early
right
well it depends if they're cooked in
[laughter]
yeah
right
right
right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it
it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how
yeah
right
right well well i think the same way with alcohol too
personally it you know that that would probably be the next
the next thing
i mean
but you know the- there's the difference because uh they say you know
i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well
oh yeah that's
there is oh there is
right
right
right
yeah well it's part of the business world too when you make
deals you know a lot of times it's uh
three martini lunch or whatever they say
[laughter]
right
yeah
yeah
makes me feel better
right
the nicotine addiction yeah
yeah i have uh my in-laws are both smokers and uh they've tried to quit
numerous times and
and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and
and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know
were known yeah
so
well i think we've probably talked long enough
well i can tell you're from you've got that New England accent
does that mean you're you're you're in uh uh New Hamp- wh-
Massachusetts
yeah i have uh
my wife's uh grandparents are from Boston they're
[noise]
um
no no you can talk about anything you want th- these things are just suggestions
uh North Carolina
it is boring here
boring
um yes yes we're [vocalized-noise]
oh yes it's it's one of our prouder [vocalized-noise] right along with Jessie Helms
i thi- i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something
yeah
somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though
yeah [noise]
oh man Jim Bakker oh what a what a dangerous individual
that's a well that's a good question um
yeah basically yeah yeah that's
that's that's most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue
and it's still that's still a big thing here in this backwards state
uh-huh yeah my favorite place is Ashville it's right over there in the mountains it's a beautiful place
it's just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place
these folks are so backwards it's just ridi- it's pathetic
yeah an- i i mean the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system they've been changing their standards and this that and the other an- claiming this is going to make everything better
uh Durham the county right next to us big city
uh had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate
and everybody was huh
oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data
yeah just just stu-
[noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
right
oh well
[noise]
i don't know
i don't i don't know what's i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they're throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse
oh yeah
i don't know that's that's the one thing that i've i've never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers
um
oh yeah
yeah i guess
it it must be i bet you know i- i i'm not knocking the garbage men i mean they're necessary but there's a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money
[noise] it is
yeah well it's it's it's hard in New York too and i mean they get paid twenty eight thousand a year to start
and teachers only get paid twenty four
you bet you
you bet you
man i'd i'd go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money
good exercise you get outside
shoo-
well
[noise]
[laughter]
ah that's what my that's what my garbage man does
i went out the other morning and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway
[laughter]
[noise]
jeez i i get tired of this i've got a there's a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they just throw them anywhere they want to
and sometimes they don't even take everything tha- that's the biggest kick
the Carolinas
no i'm not i'm not a fool
uh
i i it's okay to watch people go out and break their legs but i'm not going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick mountain side i mean that's
i've got better things to do with my life
[noise]
when i uh when i was uh stationed in England i used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot and one of my favorite places to go was Switzerland
and it was just great to sit out there in uh Zurich or Bern just sit in the sidewalk cafes
a-
yeah Salzburg nice Austria is nice Europe is nice
yeah
yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean
not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know
yeah
yeah that it's
i loved it there though
i loved it
um well i- i like Europe
except for Belgium
no
yeah i think i do because [vocalized-noise]
half of them are yeah half of them are Middle Eastern and the other half are French Expatriates
and since i hate the French anyway
the Belgians try to act like the French
and i it was just miserable i hated that place
i hate it almost as much as i do France
yeah
sure
yeah
[noise]
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
yeah couldn't even use it
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
yeah really i used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais and and and and drive across France uh horrible i only did that one time
[noise]
uh Mildenhall
oh good old Bent Waters
yeah that's a nice place
Bent Waters is a is a very nice little pla- nice little base out in the country
nobody messes with them a lot Mildenhall was pretty uh
well it was big and it got a lot of attention
but uh
yeah Bent Waters Upper Hafford
all those neat little places that's where i really wanted to be
oh Oxbridge yeah
yeah Oxbridge is nice
ah everywhere in England is nice
but on the other hand it's it's in a way it's better
tha- wh- that's what i like about it for one thing everything was cheap
um
i mean i can still remember going going to the store and getting a pint of milk a pound of butter and a loaf of bread and getting change back from my pound
you know you can't even buy a loaf of bread in this country [vocalized-noise]
all right so we're supposed to talk about food maybe we'll get a call back saying hey you're not you're not talking about food [laughter]
yeah
oh golly well i live in Dallas what what area do you live in
North Carolina oh really
oh really well
in the Carolinas they did have uh
huh and Jimmy Baker [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] he's he's not a subject of great pride [laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah
[laughter] twins separated at birth kind of thing
[laughter] somebody dropped that baby when it was born [laughter] oh
i- i i know uh how how did Jessie Helms get reelected that's that's what i want to know
what does he do does he just do the people the are there just stupid people where you live or something okay
well
oh yeah
yeah
that's too bad because i mean i've been in the Carolinas and you know there are some places in the Carolinas it's really nice there
in [vocalized-noise] like
yeah
yeah
[laughter] yeah
i- i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there
yeah
yeah
oh really
how'd they do that
oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the SAT [noise]
oh really
oh Plano Plano started having
Plano actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the classes on the SAT i've never heard anything so preposterous in my life
they're preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest
SAT rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national [laughter] i don't know where it's all going to [vocalized-noise] where it's all going to go
yeah
and you know what's bad i mean like i'm going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just
you know it really kills me you know i mean it's it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student
and the teachers are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out
yeah
well the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a woman dominated field we can treat them like dirt [laughter] you know
that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States
yeah
hey that's a
hey that's a hard job to get really
in in in Texas in Texas it's hard because it's almost like a father to son thing [laughter]
gee that's that's ridiculous
man i'd carry garbage for twenty eight thousand a year
man i worked as a welder and i wa- you don't even get paid that much
yeah
yep [vocalized-noise]
[laughter] you have [vocalized-noise] dogs are your friends [laughter] knock over a can now and then and leave it open for the dogs you know
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[noise] yeah yeah
[laughter]
oh
so you live in the Carolinas huh
uh
do much skiing
oh okay
i- i'm i'm not really impressed with i mean i lived in Germany for three years i i wa- i'm not impressed with skiing now i like
i like other
you know winter sports but i'm not real thrilled about them
[laughter]
[laughter] uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah the caf- um my my wife her favorite actually she was stationed at in in Germany with me too an-
uh
she she fell in love with Salzburg Austria
[vocalized-noise] well it's well it's such a it's it's it makes the Germans look like slobs i mean Austria and Switzerland do both but
[laughter]
oh
well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the streets like every every other day or something
pretty ridiculous
yeah
yeah i did i did like the food in Germany it was pretty good
yeah i- i'm i'm i really don't know what the Belgians i mean they have
[vocalized-noise] do they really have an identity [noise] or i mean i think they have they have an identity crisis a lot of these countries they they really don't know you know what supposed to do
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
oh my wife and i we had it when we drove through France
we paid in tolls to go to Spain
and we drove from Germany like the south- southwestern most part of Germany
we drove on the tolls and we spent forty six dollars in tolls one way oh and it was like uh it was
it was about an eighteen nineteen hour drive
oh God what a headache what a pain in the butt and
and the fuel was so expensive i mean i i just i can't believe i mean when we when we came back on our way back i mean
well my wife and i we first we were in Barcelona and we bought like [vocalized-noise] we we found this really great cafe that it was like a delicatessen
and we like we bought we filled a fu- a cooler full of food of all this delicatessen food [laughter] and then
we ate it all the way going up to the France because the food was so so bad and then when we came into Germany i had five centime left i mean that's like that's that's five one hundredths of a franc which is worth
it it was probably worth about a twentieth of a penny and and i mean i i i just about kissed the guard i mean when i got there he was like i was like we're so happy to see you he's like you're sort of knew why [laughter]
yeah yeah i- i've done that before
uh-huh
wh-
well actually actually i've gone where were you stationed at in England
oh really i was um i was TDY at Bent Waters
for a little while
yeah my brother my brother was stationed at Bent Waters for a long time
yeah
yeah
yeah
hum
yeah my my brother got stationed eventually at at Oxbridge
he he really enjoyed it there and well well his his wife was British so they had
they had quite a good time
i mean
a lot of the people i mean it's funny [laughter] they're just
i don't know the standard of living is not as high as you would ex- you would think
yeah
yeah
yeah
all right
um-hum
um i wish i had
well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going
and this was back in the eighties i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that
but uh i had a coin shop
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom
yep
yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bank- you know it was one of those things [noise] uh oh it'll get better next week you know [noise] things will pick up
and so there i was in old bankruptcy court
oh yeah yeah
oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh
you know they take payment any way they can get it
yeah course on on stuff that i was [vocalized-noise] on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because i was selling it i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it
um
but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and
all that other good stuff that ate them all up
so
um-hum
um-hum
sure
um-hum yes
that's the way they suck you in
um-hum
um-hum
[noise] well just today in the mail i got uh
i got got my
guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express
yeah
yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name
and uh
course i guess i guess i've been purged from their records i used to have an American Express
uh back when i had my business i got one
and
they they goofed up bad on my fir- on my very first bill because i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses
and the bill would come in and i'd pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay
so i- i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didn't do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier
and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay
and i looked at that and i said uh-huh
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed
attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks
yeah they were i tell you they don't talk about they were charging that enormous fee every year
it's up to fifty five on the gold card it's eighty five for the Optima
oh i'm sorry no fifty fifty
yeah for the green card
and it
well now and that's that's the card fee
oh yeah yeah it's um
well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any but on the Optima card it's um [noise]
let's see right now it's running at about it's not too bad it's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good
as far as credit cards go
[noise] well they're dangerous
hum-um mine don't either
mine don't either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and that's it
[noise] yeah yeah now i- i do use gas cards [vocalized-noise]
yeah [noise] ye- yeah
oh yeah exactly [laughter]
uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um ha-
yeah
sure
naturally that's i got in all kinds of trouble doing that [laughter]
[laughter]
well
ha- having having been out of the credit game for some years now i've i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it
and uh
well it is but i- i- i'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint
uh
yeah exactly i- i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday
with cash
and it it's
no no i wish i did [laughter]
yeah i could use a discount [laughter] i have to wait for the things to go on sale [laughter] [noise]
yeah especially on electronic goods
especially now
oh Circuit City
[noise] yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific
they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now
um-hum
yeah they're they're all over the country now
they uh th- they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains
[noise] i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise
yo- you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go
and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that
and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now
so so much for Circuit City
i don't i'm a graduate student i'm a professional student
it is
it's it's great
it is great i love it
NC State
uh North Carolina State
not yet [noise]
ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week
where am i
what do you mean where oh in Raleigh
yeah good ole [vocalized-noise]
the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh
wh- what a dead place yeah
[laughter]
i've got a nice little business at home and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time
[noise] um uh human factors
not a thing [laughter]
uh its
it's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them
huh
it's well it's more psychology and engineering uh my my master's is in industrial engineering
yeah
yeah PhD in human factors
[laughter] well
oh yeah
IBM uh
i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what i'm looking at right now
they might be but not at not at the human factors level [noise]
there there
um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person
doggone it if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me
um i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm going into thes- or going into the uh dissertation this summer
uh i'm going to start this summer i probably won't finish it until the end of the year
but uh i'm i'm trying to get a uh
a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in [laughter]
it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field
but
yeah that's that and and it's it's limited application in some respects um consi- in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people most
well like i told you before [laughter]
[laughter]
and you're talking about [noise] credit cards
[noise] we put ours up
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up
well you should try it
yeah
you lost your business oh Go- what a nightmare
well you weren't charging gold and silver were you you can't do that can you
oh you can [noise]
[noise] oh that's a nightmare [noise]
um
well [noise] i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because you're honored right and uh
i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right [noise] i wasn't thinking a thing about it
yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because you know got get such good bargains [noise]
and i don't know [noise]
oh yeah we've been getting those
i went back to school and got my Master's and they started sending those things to me again
yeah they did
uh-huh
yeah
hum
[noise]
and now they weren't check in
now what is it now
what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars
but then what's the interest
and interest is like eighteen or something
yeah
well
credit cards
you know my parents don't hardly use them
i've got all my gas cards because i don't want to carry money around i'll do that
now Impact is kind of bad too though
[laughter] you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers
[noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh
well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash
what what are you saying
oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i- i don't really usually consider that an option [laughter]
[laughter]
maybe that's how we got in trouble
yeah but it's hard isn't it
well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic
with cash
[noise]
do you work with TI
no
yeah you could have got a discount couldn't you
[laughter]
but there's always a sell
yeah
what is that thing i saw Circuit
Circuit world or something
Circuit City have you been in that
oh it's national
i think i've seen two around Dallas
well what else
yeah in Garland
uh-huh
sure
[noise] okay what else can we talk about who do you work for
[noise] sounds wonderful we were talking about that just today
we could be just lifelong students
where are you going to school
what's that
so you're on Spring Break
so where are you
yeah
oh okay
[noise]
yeah
is it [laughter]
[laughter]
so what are you getting your degree in
and what do you do with it
well what is it
so it's sociology
so you're working on your doctorate
oh lord
oh that'll that'll sound wonderful won't it [noise]
get you a little name plaque
aren't aren't they laying off several thousand people
well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM
hum
how much longer do you have
and get that done this summer
ooh
because you
why there been so much work done already
uh the causes of crime [noise] um [noise] i think it was an imbalance of of power in the United States that's causing the lower c- class to rebel
that's why there's su- such high crime in uh
there's crime in uh young people because they don't have rea- role models
see too much crime on TV and they think it's way to go
i don't know what do you think [noise]
um-hum
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
from anybody else
yeah
yeah
yeah i think i can agree with that too
[noise]
that's true
you got to kind of make w- people wanna do the right thing
i don't know how you do that
yeah
well i i've heard this one theory that if you know if a kid commits a crime that they've instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent or both of them
now p- put the blame on the parent
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um-hum yeah
hm
no i didn't see it
yeah
yeah
yeah what about with adults you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime
[laughter]
yeah huh for well the major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded
um-hum
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean seriously they ought to put those good people to work
yeah
hm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well th-
yeah they you still have to punish
yeah
yeah that's you know
yeah and they're they're still they can
provide for society whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society
yeah
[laughter] yeah that's true
no i don't think so either um
yeah
and they keep taking more money from us yeah people and get and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just gonna take fifty percent of it
they might as well steal it then they don't have to pay taxes on it
yeah
um-hum
they'd have a
yeah
yeah
[noise] hm
yeah
no i don't know [laughter] definitely
i'm not counting on it [laughter] [noise]
yeah
hm
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
[noise] uh i'm in Raleigh North Carolina
[laughter] why where are you from
okay
oh man
um-hum
yeah
ow
why did they do it in the freezer [laughter]
yeah
hm
hm
that's awful [laughter] yeah we still get some in Raleigh i mean not not too often real bad ones but
i don't think there's anywhere where there isn't gonna be crime so
um-hum
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
hm
he's probably drug dealer himself [laughter] never know
wow
hm
hm
time to go
yeah
yeah i'm kind of in the same same kind of deal townhouse in the neighborhood
it's pretty nice
[noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah
most of them too scared to do anything about it
yeah
all right well listen i got to go it's good talking to you
alrighty bye-bye
[noise]
so what do you think
yep
what about
i agree with the upper and lower level you know
because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to
but i also blame some of it on parents
because parents aren't parents
because i remember even when i was growing up
[noise] i'm thirty five [laughter] i remember when i was growing up and i had friends
that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us it's like i don't care what your friends do
if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mea- more trouble from my mother than from
from anybody else and i think that's the basic is they have no morals anymore so they don't care
so [vocalized-noise]
but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know
you can't make parents be parents [laughter]
you know
i guess if you gave the gave them jobs th- that's another problem with the United States there's no jobs anymore
but
that'll work to a point
well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i don't care what you do to them
you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in
you know
because uh a child can get into anything regar- i don't care who how good y- -ey are
event- at least one time but now if it's a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all thi- to me yeah both of them because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do
because i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them [vocalized-noise] shows where this boy had been stealing cars
i don't know if you seen [vocalized-noise] they was the g- a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they're gonna take me away from you that means she was warned
but see by that i think th- sometimes it a little late
you know but i'm sure there's something can be done
yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system
well they should start with the th- if they would get rid of seems to me i know there's a lot about courts that people don't understand there's more people in jail right now for child support
okay [noise] then there are for people doing drugs
they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go
you know give them a fine whatever make them do civic duty whatever put them fools in there that's what they need to put i c- i call them all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them in there
you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them all in jail you know and let all the normal people go
you know because okay
if you write a bad check you go to jail right
okay let them people go
not let them go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else
you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is [laughter] but
put don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals
um-hum
so
i don't know them people boy they got th- i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else
now how they gonna fix it i don't know the i don't think there is a ready solution
because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it
uh he's gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet
um-hum
yeah
that's it
so you know they i i know that's bad but you know th- just like Texas now
they could of had a lottery they don't want a lottery why not
i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i'm paying you know a week or whatever
and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck
because you know they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won't be here when i get that old you know
because we're paying for Social Security they using now who's gonna pay for mine
yeah [laughter] but it's it's [laughter] nah you don't count on Social Security but it's it's that's what i'm saying they need to do something else
but
crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down
and it's gonna get worse that's just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at
[noise] oh [laughter] no wonder you don't know the-
[noise] they killed
i'm in Dallas
[noise] but last night [laughter] they killed uh uh four people in a chain food
and killed them well it was two stores side by side
[noise] one was a store and one was like a a fast food place i think i- chicken or something i don't know [noise] anyway they raped the women
beat them all up including the women i mean they just beat them
stuffed them in the freezer and then shot them all
n- [noise] why was you know [noise] dumb
you know why didn't they just if they was gonna lock just lock them in the freezer take the money you know they didn't have to kill them or rape them or anything
um-hum
it's just getting really ridiculous down here i wish i could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country but
well i think if it's the town is smaller
and everybody knows everybody it's harder to come in there and do something
where i- and and and see that's another thing neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore
there's nobody next door to you you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that
it's just huh-uh [laughter] you know because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers
and you didn't even and the what the manager the manager won't even do anything
um-hum
you don't and so i moved because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up
you know and this is like across the street this was a nice part of town
and then across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um
crack stuff and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner i said see this is it
that's it and i moved and you know now i live in like a fa- a neighborhood in a townhouse but it's nice i don't you know
but
i don't know how they can let a neighborhood or apartment complex that's what ha- that's what's wrong you know
i don't think don't rent to them [laughter] or rent to them evict them because they drug dealers put it on the lease if you deal drugs you can't live here
um-hum
that's it
well
[noise] alrighty and i thank you bye-bye
[noise]
okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting
well when you decide to
uh-huh
so you like the Ford
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did
But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X
But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to te- six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
oh yeah those were not good cars
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh You know the only thing i'm looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was
[noise] So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know
uh cars are too expensive right now to uh
to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
yeah that's uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago
and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But
then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were
um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and
you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i
that doesn't seem likely
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think so
that's happened to me once so uh
yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Sau- the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so
uh-huh
yeah
you too uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well none at the moment [laughter] No no no
i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and
i would ima- i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard
absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it's uh
it's everything it's supposed to be uh i haven't had
a minutes trouble with it and uh
the only thing i have
against it in that's it's a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that
and so it's a little bit larger but that's the only the only difference that i see really
but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally
and
um-hum
uh-huh
uh-huh
well my wife drives a
still has a a Honda Accord and it's a very it's an excellent automobile
and uh but you know price and so forth i'm not a real car fan so i i
i do not uh
opt for uh something that would be
you know
expensive you know i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and it's you know
you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines
and as i said as far i'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted
uh-huh
oh i think so too now i
you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in i've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so for- and Dodge and i
if it's Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh
i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a
a Chevy um Citation
and uh i was ready to get rid of it [laughter] two months after i bought it and uh
so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i
uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota
and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop
and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable
comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh
it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that
soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it
but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable
and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and
not really be tired in any way
but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that uh
is comparable to what i have now
so i'll go ahead and get it
[noise]
um-hum
uh-huh
[laughter] i see yeah [laughter]
in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars
uh i i can't remember what the name is it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is
and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely
and [noise]
it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but
to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just
i can't i can't conceive of doing that [laughter]
um-hum
that's true well
uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen
so i've never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little
you know sports car racing i never
it was never my own car it was always someone else's
and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive
uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so
well i guess we've discussed that enough don't you think [laughter] we won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight that's happened to me almost every time i've [laughter]
well whe- it's it's very easy when you get a top- you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and
oh yeah yeah
[laughter]
well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uh-huh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening
take care good-bye
[noise]
sure
okay
is it
well um
yeah i'd
i agree with the the ease in the use of it
and uh
the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it
and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system
and tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often
so i think that's the the one place where
uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
exactly
right
right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and
so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm more than [laughter]
uh familiar with the metric system
and uh
but
i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasn't afraid of the metric system and it and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way
so i i it's too bad that more Americans can't don't have the opportunity to to really use it
to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion
because if you just
the ini- in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing
and it's getting over that hurdle that will
finally get us into it if if we ever get into it
right
right
okay
yep
right
right [laughter] right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to
it
okay
no
i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calc- i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
right it's interesting in the in though the work i'm doing i'm uh
uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from
basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where they're producing a product
and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh
doing the initial uh
development of an idea use the metric system
and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units
in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product
do most of their [vocalized-noise] carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units
which i i find
it's interesting that it's like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system
but the ones that come up with the they're doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um
are doing it in terms of the metric system i i
it kind of seems strange
but
and Sao Paulo
uh-huh
no kidding uh
and do you fly into Camgonias or the the other one down there down south
yeah okay the international air-
yeah
uh-huh
sure sure
uh the Air Force Academy
uh i'm one of those [laughter]
[noise] yeah
no no i'm i'm still in the i'm still a second lieutenant
i just graduated in eighty nine
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
right
right
oh [vocalized-noise] that's it [vocalized-noise] you got to
oh yeah
right
well the the whole
yeah i don't [vocalized-noise]
or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or it's it's base ten rather and so how can you have
how can you have these uh stran- i- i-
[noise]
okay Brian i going to press number one and we'll go
[noise]
hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didn't even realize that another system existed
uh but it makes so darn much sense to me
over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people don't take to it
yeah i understand
no no
yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy
we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all
and uh you know it's uh it's easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil
uh it's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent
uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically
i've got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers
and she'll look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running
and basically all of the races now are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore
uh and i guess that's got me thinking metrically
also uh uh we have lived overseas uh from nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived in Quadalampor Malaysia
and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines
and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically
and ultimately at some point you know it doesn't happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances
okay
oh yes yes
yeah
yeah i i i don't think it's going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine
uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English
uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school
[noise]
and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller
[noise]
[noise] are you there
okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling
and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced
uh the drawback to that is i don't think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it
[laughter]
and and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters
oh yeah i i i don't think we could even think English uh and i'm just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though
and it's interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six uh tenths of an inch i guess we do that
but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the uh to the base
and we talk about that in terms of kilograms
so we use it a lot uh we talk about uh gold ball bonds uh bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate
so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so that's the way we do it
uh
uh-huh
right uh you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts
oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas
and i'm there several times a year
uh and of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas
uh i use the other one
i can't think the name of it
yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times i've come in from Mexico City via Menaus
and uh before that though it's uh it's uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight
and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree
oh okay okay
yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military
oh okay
oh okay okay you're you're yo- you're a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system
i've got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark that's got an odometer uh that's a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and it's in metric and i can push a button and it's in English
and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer
and it was uh floating up there around a a a hundred a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didn't realize you were going this fast
and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but
it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them
because if we if we keep doing that it's it's not going to work
but
but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money
you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically
uh [vocalized-noise] but but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard [laughter] i [laughter] you know
yeah
hi
oh me i'm in favor of it
yeah i thought i think if uh
people like Charles Manson
[vocalized-noise]
the the heinous crimes uh even if it's one time offense
yeah
[noise]
[noise]
yeah well i know that th- um
like they can hold it off for years by uh i'm trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um
i'm for- i cannot think of that word
you have to make sure they're guilty
yeah
uh-huh
ye- well i think it's all uh i don't think they have uh execution here
i i do know though it's easy to get put in jail for life
TV station
yeah he's they're wanting to record a gas chamber
well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes
you know
yeah i yeah i agree with you there too
yeah well i'll agree with you there i don't agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it
but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing thi- you know they'll think about this and say hey i don't think so
yeah
yeah
yeah that's
i don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn't be able to watch it
and i'm i'm supposed to be an adult
yeah well there's more wrong people that would see it than right people
uh you know uh
but i i i don't know i think i would
[noise]
say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen
now my aunt had a uh thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her
and she would say that they should uh
for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch
[laughter]
that would stop them from wanting to
no well i thought it was funny listening to her she's just a she's she's a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well she's vicious
[noise]
yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of [vocalized-noise] they had a television program about him two hour movie
can't think of his name
but he spent quite a f- few quite a while in jail
yeah
[noise] well you see that on television also
[noise]
yeah that's a problem with capital punishment though bu- when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain
i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill
and uh
that's a man that should be put to death
yeah
that's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest
i uh i don't think anyone would miss him either
yeah
well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh
what
i'm in Denison
yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night
uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein
i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him
i think the
now if one of the Kurds uh i'm sure you know who they are
if they went in and got him he wouldn't be a [vocalized-noise] what's the word martyr martyr martyr martyr
i could see the word in my head i just couldn't pronounce it
uh but if we did it oh man
they'd have him up on a pedestal
yeah that's what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i'm just now getting into the world politics and all that
uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something
uh but uh
yeah well it's getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what he's talking about
i don't put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but
i'll listen [laughter] and agree with what i think sounds right
yeah well i think they uh
the people there will take care of him now
right
you are
right
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things
we had to pick a topic to to investigate
and uh at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common
and if you ten- and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter
the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well
i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um
[noise]
you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn't get you'd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn't communicate well
and at that time it just seemed so f- unfair
that um i i felt like i couldn't uh um
you know i just didn't agree with it
it's gotten so though that there are so many
you know there are so many uh
i don't know what you call it uh so many different things that you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty that i'm not so sure it it seems a lot fairer than it used to be
right
right
right uh i know what you're saying um
but yeah they there's you know there's always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that's good i mean if you're going to [laughter] if you're going to kill somebody
right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious
um i don't know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven't heard anyth- any anything about somebody being executed or anything
i don't i don't either
yeah [noise]
well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station
yo- did you see that
i thought that was disgusting i mean
well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that
and that's what that's what really bothers me you know i'm all for deterrents
but i i think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it into a circus
and
no
right
sure
well where i could see it being very useful is for you know wh- if there's a first time offender part of his punishment is that he's got to see what you know what he's up against
you know what what you know what might happen but th- you know for TV sta- you know that TV station isn't going to want to restrict how they use it
and they're going to show it on the six o- well probably not the six o'clock news but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock eleven o'clock news
and i don't you know i've got a ten year old and
you know she's she could very well be up at that time
you know when we're and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old [laughter]
right
right
right and in fact i think it'd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it
so that has to be brought into the picture too
you know you just can't blatantly say let's let's show it and and the the right people will see it and it'll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh
yeah yeah
[laughter]
right
yeah
right
yeah my wife says that all the time [laughter]
yeah well that that would certainly do it [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake [laughter] then
you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely uh mistakenly accused of a crime and
yeah
i can't i can't think eith-
yeah right
that's right and and it turns out he didn't do it
or you know and and it's easy you know and and you know let's face it not all policemen are honest and
that's right
and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime
and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well
and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them
right
yeah yeah well he was a
yeah sheesh
and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive
you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably
right right that's right and he's probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more
and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it's just so hard [laughter] it's just so hard to to be fair and uh
yeah i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if if all of a sudden he didn't exist any more uh
no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein
you know you know th- jeez you know they're just they're just the scum of the earth
and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that
[laughter]
now where where where area where are you from
Denison oh okay
and every so often you get somebody who's in in uh California or or New York some-
yeah yeah
yeah
i think you're right i don't think we're i think we're we'd we'd overstep our bounds if we went in and did that
though it's awfully tempting
yep
martyr
yeah
yeah
oh yeah the whole
well right now we're in a delicate situation because we've got this
we- for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries
yeah
oh sure
it's complicated
oh
right
[laughter]
right
right [laughter]
yeah there and you know it's a he's got that delicate balance right there and we'd just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over
yeah i just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it
i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you s- this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you're just not willing
um-hum
[noise]
right or the satellite dish [laughter]
on top of those recreational vehicles [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah we have a little bit and we've just gotten one of those little tents [laughter] that we throw out on the ground and that's what we camp in so we kind of rough it
um-hum
oh no
[laughter]
oh uh-huh
gosh bear bait [laughter]
[laughter]
that would make me nervous [laughter]
have you done any camping around here
uh-huh
yeah that sounds fun
[laughter]
right [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah do you go on long like a week at a time or just weekends
uh-huh
oh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower [laughter]
uh-huh yeah we've uh we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas
in the fall and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice
that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn't need it
oh really
yeah
[laughter]
oh yeah [laughter]
uh-huh
that sounds nice
yeah
[laughter]
yeah it's a lot of work to set up just for one night
right
[laughter]
yeah those are nice we have one of those too uh-huh
yeah how do you blow yours up
oh w- we were looking at those in a magazine last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us [laughter]
and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can
fill them up that way but it something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient
no uh-huh we have a [vocalized-noise] my husband and i we have a pickup truck so there's plenty of room to hold things
uh-huh
oh no [laughter]
yeah
oh
we take we take our dog camping she likes
to go out and stay in the woods sleep she sleeps in the tent with us
it's fun
oh me either
oh no
uh-huh
oh boy
that was lucky
we've been lucky we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone
oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in Virginia and
we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground
but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a ye- the year we we were really into camping
uh no it's a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh
you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and
it had two double beds in it
oh since the beginning
i guess it's been two or three weeks
uh well i work as a temporary in the Speech Lab
uh-huh where they're doing this program
the voice recognition program
oh they turn them over to somebody and they're going to
i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff
right yeah
i don't know
i type up the tapes of what people talked about
yeah it's sort of interesting
uh-huh everything like that all the little stutters and everything
oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that
well i guess that's it for camping huh [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
yeah
[noise]
oh uh-huh that's what we have too yeah that's what ours is
yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast
have you ever camped on sand
that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable
you just coul- everywhere you went there was sand you couldn't even when you're eating it it was in your bed [laughter]
uh-huh
oh
[noise]
[laughter]
uh-huh
okay well it's good talking to you bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay [noise] i was thinking about camping and different i- people's ideas about it
[noise] we've even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when they're going but that's not
yeah a satellite dish
oh golly that's not the kind we do do you go camping
[laughter]
well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family
[noise] and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it's dangerous i wouldn't do it now but we did
[noise] and one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing we couldn't find a place to camp and so we were
on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess
and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our food you know
and told us to get inside our car
[laughter] bear bait
yeah
yeah we've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler
and go up there fairly often
[noise] sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it
and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold we take extension cords and we've all got heaters in our tents
and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going
so we're not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the kids
and they've got their electrical hookups
so it's not so bad
i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there
so that's really not roughing it so much but
[noise]
we have gone on trips we've bathed in streams
that's kind of different
and a pool to go to that would be nice [noise]
well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there
i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all
but they had the time of their lives you know
had the boat just pulled up right by the tents
[noise]
it wasn't bad
yeah and we've taken our tents though loaded them up in the car carrier
and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night
we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel
instead of getting out all that stuff you know
[vocalized-noise] yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on
huh-uh
but we're set now we've got cook stoves and we've got our bug light
and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable
yeah those double ones
pretty good we're on our third one i think somehow
we've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter
i didn't know you could do that
[noise]
yeah
no joke [noise] i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner
[noise]
yeah now we've used a hair dryer before
but i put it on hot and also melted it
i found that you don't do that
i didn't realize it would melt so easily
i don't know
yeah
i don't like it when there's mosquitoes so bad
and then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the steaks on the grill
these people were with us and it
[noise] i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know
and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything
so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah
yeah it was
it's horrible
you mean that you put on a truck or what
oh yeah yeah
how many weeks have you been doing these calls
i think this must be into my third week too
so do you work for TI
in a speech lab
and what exactly are they going to do
so any voice no matter what the
speech pattern or the dialect or anything
[noise]
hum
i wonder if these are going to be speaking
the computers
oh that's kind of neat
do you put all the uh-hums in here on everything too
what do you write for stutter
duh duh
uh-huh
[laughter] i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes which kind of stakes to put in
you need metal instead of plastic
and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got one of those kind that have got the
oh what is it
they're plastic and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and it's a dome tent
that's good isn't it
yeah
but
um no
i've done it in a shelter
it was in Padre Island and in a truck [noise] of course it's not but not in a tent
oh well that's about all i know to okay uh-huh bye
[noise]
[noise]
hello this is Jim in Dallas uh how you doing
oh you're right here okay yeah i'm i'm actually working tonight i just uh called and came in
so do you work at TI
yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls
[laughter] yeah well i haven't get a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them yet
my daughter uh got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too
and uh
Virginia or something like that she's talked to two students
yeah
oh yeah great uh we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh
do you have anybody that you uh h- are close to that decision on or anything or i've thought about it for myself and all and my wi- my wife's mother is uh
in a retirement home she's not in a nursing home uh
yeah did i did we push
let me i'll hit [noise] again just in case
i did it right as she said yeah
but uh she's she's down in San Antonio it's it's a uh
it's a brand new one it's a Catholic uh
retirement home for nuns it's at uh Trinity no let me see Trinity i keep calling it Trin- it's not Trinity i'll think of
Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people
yeah and that one's really super now i- i know what they're talking about on regular retirement yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses
and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice i mean it's just super
oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks we've been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year
she drives and everything she she's perfectly healthy uh
well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house
and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so
she's happy as as heck uh and they they have serve meals of course
and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice now i
i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one
and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick it's a tough question
oh you got ex- more experience than i do then on it
yeah yeah
oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know
um-hum
yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer
i've seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and and boy that really pumps them up that uh
is very nice to see young people i think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home
if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them
ob- obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them visit and everything
yeah
right
yeah i think you do get more by stimul- stimulation my in fact my mother-in-law just visited she's just about seventy five again perfectly fine
but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas
when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio [vocalized-noise] my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better she's much more alive and and uh active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and
and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that's the fastest way to die i think you know
oh yeah i'm afraid i'm a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off but it is sad it's sad yeah
oh yeah
yeah
right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east i'm from the east really
and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore
to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right
oh yeah
oh right right
yeah
oh
well that's nice in a lot of ways
but that you were [vocalized-noise] you said that by mistake yeah right
that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i- i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than
you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well
i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah
[laughter]
that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife's mother and the one she's in San Ant- it's you know it's everything but the opposite of what you've seen i mean it's uh it's a little ho- hotel you might say and
again a swimming pool and grounds
and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area
they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like uh
on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know
oh yeah it's it's it's nothing like that it's like living in the hotel i mean she's totally on her own
uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know
and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know
i know
i- i know go ahead i'm sorry
oh he still drives
that's gr- well it's wonderful in one one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah
yeah
right
that's good i mean people are all different
i- i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years
are they doing it
yeah
well everybody needs retraining it doesn't hurt uh
you know [vocalized-noise] best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i don't know why you couldn't
after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know
right there you go there's a good point very good point
very good point but i think they nee- [vocalized-noise] should do that and then the families will have said
hello
fine i'm Callie in Garland
yes
oh are you
yeah you
[vocalized-noise]
i know i know aren't they
i love it in the
it was a lot nicer than i expected
i've talked to i don't think they were students one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been New York
so
yes we are
oh well that's not did you push the button
did you
okay just in case [laughter]
now what's
oh
oh
well isn't that neat
isn't that neat
uh-huh oh that's good
that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them
oh
right what made you all decide to put her or h- what made her decide to go
right by herself
ah
[laughter]
well that's good
that's great
um-hum
[noise]
right shut-ins and
yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at at
well [laughter] it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess
and uh i just oh i just felt for those people th- especially the ones that never got visited
that just bothered me
that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen
and that really made a bad impression on me so i've always thought
not not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i- i believe are probably pretty good for the people but
i don't know it's just a
that would be a tough tough decision
right
helps yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
right
yeah and get that youth back
you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so
um you know just stationary i mean they'll get in a wheelchair or they'll just sit in a chair and and till you come along and really try and pump them up they're just
stationary and i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long
so
um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything i think that's a real real neat idea
yeah
that's
yeah
right
right
stagnant [laughter] yeah that's exactly right i think they're really neat um of course i've seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me
[laughter]
it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on TV with uh bed sores and
uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that the- these people have have given so much of their lives you know to
to America you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them we just put them in a home and leave them
um-hum
right
i think it's
right i think it's neat i think uh you learn a lot from them y-
from all their experiences and and that's one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories
i think that's neat because they really have a lot of good i- insights
that my fa- my husband's father is really old he he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year
and i just uh he lives with different
you know people in the family he'll switch from time to time i just
yeah i just couldn't imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just
lock him up
oh i know i know
r- right right
exactly
um-hum
that's right
[laughter]
oh you're not going to put me away [laughter] that's what my mother she always you're going to lock me up one day aren't you i can t- i can tell you're going to lock me up
i know it
right
that's great
gosh
right
yes
prepare your
well that's great c- now can she leave um on a day by herself
oh man that's neat
yeah
[laughter]
right
right
i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them by doing that that's like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and [noise] that would really be hard we've
uh well we've thought about doing that for for my husband's father because he's
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] well luckily he drives a big old tank [laughter]
so he i mean i don't think he he could get hurt i just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone but he he hasn't had any accidents luckily
yeah yeah
right
i saw that on Twenty Twenty that
they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because
you i think they do come become less aware and
they just
i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help
[laughter] no that's
right
right at least that way the burden's not on the family of taking their license or their car away
it's on the state
[laughter]
the taxes tend to uh keep going up but
uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's [noise] that's worse off in what they end up paying
but uh go ahead
yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and
and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and
being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh
still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way
uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh
a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and
and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government
so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes
people
desire that that money not be spent well
no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's
well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent
so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some
and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere
but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes
yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of
lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's
it's a real mixed blessing i guess to
yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone
oh
uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work [laughter]
yeah yeah
the uh bureaucracy seems to spend
more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh
an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases
so it make
yeah
and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on
to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever
and they just keep trying to to
close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and
and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse
um-hum
right
it does seem to be the case
i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a
hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every
dollar you make or spend it gets uh
steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then
just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction
i don't know what what would happen if we
uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much
uh therefore you should be taxed this much uh that would only encourage saving it's not a
you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff
but if you put the burden on
the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it
so [vocalized-noise] most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our in- income brackets
so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would
pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't have to get or what they cou- could save they wouldn't get taxed on
yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward
a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know
avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they
you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money
and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might
might do all right i don't know it seems
yeah
that's for sure
right
that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway so
you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away
yeah the uh
the taxes are are
kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh loo- looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there
it's not all that pleasant anywhere
[noise]
yeah pretty much
well i hear one of my kiddos doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and may-
m- maybe we'll catch each other again
i'll try bye
[noise]
i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes
without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far
i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet
yes
right
right
do you all pay state income tax
neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax
and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent
wow
right
well that's good
that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots
and i- i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again
i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R [laughter]
i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i- i wonder if if they realize
the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through
and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i- i- i definitely don't think that the added
steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws
they will find a way
if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them
right
right [laughter]
and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it
yeah
yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest
yo- you'd still be ahead
and that's something that's something i need t- to learn a lot more about is is
under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future
because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time
we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought
no
we still look pretty good don't we
okay
it's been nice talking to you
okay have a good evening
thanks bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[laughter]
well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there
uh because i think without peace we're not going to get uh stable oil prices and
and uh i'd i'd really like to see stability in in that area because i'm always afraid that's where uh another big war is going to start
not that Desert Storm was a small one
i saw um just recently where uh uh the US is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to uh
actually i heard that the Israelis were even talk- at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights
yeah
okay
well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace
yeah
oh yeah [laughter]
do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there
i i haven't heard that i i watch CNN every once in a while but i i haven't specifically heard anything about that
what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet
and uh [laughter] well i guess there's still the possibility that uh hostilities with uh US troops could still break out
[noise]
yeah
do you have relatives over in Israel
oh really
[laughter]
yeah
do you uh d- does she ever want to go back to Syria
oh okay
no
no [laughter]
do you ever want to go over to Israel
oh okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of Kosher foods there at your house
um-hum
yeah
yeah no no no uh kishkes or knishes or
oh
i got you
yeah
still get your Passover Matzi and all that right
[laughter]
oh really i dated uh i dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago
and i was the only Goyim at at all the you know Seder dinners and everything and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would sell me [laughter]
[laughter] not not
yeah not uh just just enough to get by [laughter]
okay
oh
wow
oh really [laughter]
yeah
well they had the matter of fact i just watched uh Charles Heston this uh this weekend in the Ten Commandments
did you
[laughter]
[laughter]
well that's uh to me it's it's really um
i- i- i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh
that that people that believe in God and and love not war and to forgive can't get together
you know i mea- i i know that the problems are so deep but i mean e- even within the Muslim uh religions different sects they can't get together
yeah
or the uh the the you know the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland
you know i mean i- i
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
[laughter]
it sounds like a it sounds like a John Lennon uh type
gosh
so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East
yeah [laughter]
well yeah that's probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're going to come from there
uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell
really
that'd be interesting because i um i actually um um i'm i'm i'm Jewish and i'm actually sort of not n- not not not really a Zionist per se you know i'm not
but i have a um
i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel should it's his right and they do whatever they want and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing [laughter]
and uh you know in some sense m- the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down
right the- then then it then is it worth it at all
i mean i i because the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well
they won you know they sort of took over the um
they're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start
basically so
so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um [noise] but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape [noise]
um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um
there there there's some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East
actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think
and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um
i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there
that's true
[laughter] yeah
yeah that th- th- they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet
but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in Iraq right now
you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there
i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and
it's going to be worse
i don't know um
no i don't i ha- i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um
yeah so i am we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home um
and uh pardon me i'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now [laughter] in the background but we um we
she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia ac- well friends in Saudi Arabia and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of out of the home life [laughter]
no she was she's actually um
i think it's um for her not not really relevant because she was she's second generation American actually
[noise]
her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to Syria but but they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit
right about now
you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable
yeah i i'd actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess
and i do i d- i do like it actually um i would never live there i think i'm too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of
th- the easy life but i do like the food
if that if so
if that if if that amounts for anything
yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that o- one of the strangest things about about Israel is that
no um most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um
and you know um in general really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel so you you i'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox
[noise]
turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in Israel what you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods the same foods that you find in um Syria and Egypt and everything else you find things called [vocalized-noise] have you ever had those
which is
oh oh knishes no you don't y- you you don't see a lot of that that's basically Eastern European Jewish food
it's it's very different i'm i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't Israeli it was more Jewish you know
it it it it is very strange um
that that starts tomorrow night
that's what i'm making that's what i'm doing now i'm making dinner
ought to buy the bread from [laughter]
that's great well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you
got got the vocabulary down and everything
that that that's actually real good yeah we um we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that um um most of my friends aren't Jewish and and and my wife's not but i
but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seder's you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be Jewish
two two years ago we had a Seder we had sixteen people each night
sixteen seems the magic number for us
and i was the only Jew both nights
so
so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um
so get to see it and my view is
Passover is should sort of be i- in in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ
so
oh yeah i caught the end of that
yeah every year i try and catch that
but yeah that's what always amazes me actually is that um
is that you know my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about sh- her her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know
um um it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other
right
right that that's actually the part that that that i find really strange i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the Palestinians
but i sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves
you know i mean and and that seems really weird
right exactly
same same thing
i don't i'll i'll i'll never understand it uh my view is look what'd you ever do to me
didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten
have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get toge- you know when we were young everything was great because we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the mi- you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged
you know and tha- and tha- and that's what that's what kindergarten was like and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together
woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other a- as we left
yeah [laughter] i wonder if he secretly did that
do you have a favorite type of music you listen to
okay
uh-huh i tend to favor uh rock and roll mostly from the sixties and seventies
yeah i listen to KGPS classic rock
[laughter]
right
uh yeah i'm in Plano
[laughter]
uh-huh do you play any instruments
never have
uh well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester i'll never forget Mrs Burkhalter
she had that Nazi mentality [laughter]
uh in Milwaukee
uh-huh
chopsticks
okay
well i have no idea what that is [laughter]
i just know i hated it
but i took up trumpet after that and ended up playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band
which was fun
it uh
uh-huh
oh we had a great time in the band my uh director was heavy into the big bands so we played a lot of tunes by uh Glen Miller and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey and people like that
so it was a lot of fun plus i got to get to go to all the uh athletic events free [laughter]
well which uh sixties uh rock bands do you like the best
uh-huh
right
is that right
um
uh yeah certainly but uh
right uh-huh
yeah i think i've got all those [laughter]
um
oh i started my uh music collection in college when i started winning radio contests
well they would uh tell you to call in and be caller number nine and win
so i had a touch tone telephone in college and uh i just started calling in and winning all kinds of contests
i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them [vocalized-noise] to play them on
i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years
so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that
it was
yeah well that was in Madison i i won about four times a week
it doesn't have near the population that Dallas has the contests here are a lot more competitive
um
yeah but not the same type of contests um
they have contests on the radio in the morning and i think i won one of the movie mystery contests one time
they sent me uh a small flag in the mail that whi- which had postage due [laughter]
[laughter]
no [laughter]
it was a
it wasn't much of a victory actually i did win tickets to the to a Chicago and a Beach Boys concert
uh-huh
uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed
every now and then i'll go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones
i enjoy listening to those old tunes they don't play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station
uh-huh
yeah i
i uh yeah i haven't made any kind of effort to keep up on uh recent music especially in rock and roll
there's not just too much uh new stuff that's well
it's not as creative
and the lyrics aren't as uh
inspiring [laughter] if you want to call it that
yeah lot of pop music out that just isn't very thrilling
course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely
certainly is just turn on MTV any night
[laughter]
they'll be playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or
groups like that
yeah
i always like the easier listening rock the the Crosby Stills Nash and Young Eagles uh in more recent uh Billy Joel very talented
Z Z Top is uh different very creative th- they really uh made uh quite a transition
they used to be almost a country band
uh playing such
yeah such classics as La Grange and Touche
and [laughter]
right
but uh they they really did change
all of a sudden they became a top forty type group appealing to the younger crowd
uh very good videos yeah i'm kind of impressed [laughter]
quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd
to the pop audience i guess you'd call it that
Robert Palmer's got some cr- pretty creative vid- videos out too
oh yeah and there are some that are that get artsy to a point like Steve Winwood
uh-huh
well who's uh who's who's popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music
i don't listen too much
right yeah i've heard of her uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
right that's interesting
well i don't think i'd ever make a song writer
[laughter]
yeah well some people get lucky and i guess if you're persistent enough sometimes it works out
uh-huh
well what station plays uh that type of music
okay
all right
right uh-huh
right
maybe i'll tune in to one of those some time
all right
right okay [laughter]
okay yeah i still feel like every time if i ever feel like reminiscing over the old stuff i'll go ahead and throw on a sixties tape
get something from from the Guess Who or [laughter]
[noise]
um most frequently i listen to contemporary Christian music but i like all forms
i uh we i listen to country and rock and classical
jazz is probably my least favorite although i enjoy it too
oh yeah some great sixties tunes
KGPS in Dallas
oh are you in Dallas
uh [laughter] well probably around the corner [laughter] um
yeah that's a good station i listen to it every once in a while too
no i don't
i'm not musically gifted at all
[laughter]
[laughter] Miss Burkhalter
[laughter]
wh- uh uh where'd you grow up
oh okay
the uh
yeah the only thing how to play on the piano is that two handed thing or the two person thing
no it's not chopsticks it's the other one that has the um
oh i don't even i don't i don't know enough about music to do it but [vocalized-noise] you the bottom person uses two hands and the top person just uses one hand
and it's this little melody i it may have been a girl thing
[laughter]
oh really
yeah i went to i went to uh Rice and we had the marching owl band which is quite a it's not known for its musical abilities more so its um comedy abilities
oh yeah
well that that was fun
[laughter]
yeah that has its plusses for sure
oh well the Beatles
Creedance Clearwater Revival uh Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was still all four
um
there uh Black Sabbath did a few albums that i really like [laughter]
yeah they i know it's kind of strange um Elton John is more seventies
Yellow Brick Road
i love that album
yeah i had Yellow Brick Road and something happened to it it escaped me and it was sometime in college and never have seen it again
how'd you win radio contests
[laughter]
that's great
that's incredible i've never won not one thing from a radio station i haven't tried i probably haven't tried two hundred and thirty times but
yeah have you ever won in Dallas
oh
um
you're kidding me
oh it's not it's probably not quite the same
i saw th- i went to a Beach Boys concert i like them too
[laughter]
um i've never been to a Chicago concert bet it was great
yeah yeah Chicago was great too
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i use my scan button a lot
whole lot
[laughter]
i uh i enjoy mainly the old the older rock and roll tunes rather than
a lot of the new stuff is the lyrics are so repetitive
that i just kind of get lost in it
it doesn't seem to be
yeah
yeah some of the tunes used to you know you felt like you needed to go out and do something about it
yeah
[laughter] is there still that type of music available
oh
no i've got small children [laughter] i don't trust MTV
yeah yeah
yeah i uh
i tried when um i guess i was in junior high high school
when uh
Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody i tried to you know really go the whole way and i couldn't go with even
with most of Led Zeppelin's music i didn't enjoy it
and some of the stuff you know the classics they were fine but
some of it was just too heavy even then
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah they play they play some they get some play time on the country stations even
yeah
i've still got my Fandango album that one didn't get lost in college [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah they've got they've now they've got some good videos
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah [laughter]
the
i i was thinking that yeah he's his his videos are pretty wild i like his music too
uh-huh
yeah
now see i know a little bit [laughter]
i know a little bit about other groups
i uh
like i said i listen to primarily contemporary Christian
and uh
but i spend enough time on scan that i hear what i- what is still on the radio well i don't know
oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she's even she's got a song right now that playing on a a few of the other stations it's called Baby Baby it's
it's neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of
you know it's just like oh i love you and i you know this that and the other [laughter] but she write she wrote when she was talking to her baby
and if you've got a baby i mean it's kind of neat thinking about it talking up to your baby and to to an infant
so it it makes it neater but
[laughter]
my secretary has tried to be a song writer
she's waiting for her big time
yeah
yeah
well
yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it she's a nice person
[laughter]
so
i uh
uh ninety four point one is KLTY
and uh then there's ninety point one is KCBI they do more uh
they spend a lot of time with uh
oh this
preaching kind of stuff
so i like music i like listening to music so i don't usually listen to KCBI
and then there's another one called Journey that's somewhere in between the two of those it's in between ninety and ninety four
i think it's ninety two
ninety four point one is fun
i mean it's it's
it's mainly
um just family oriented stuff i mean yeah it's very its definitely Christian but it's not it's not hymns
[laughter]
you know it's not Amazing Grace every other time
yeah
hi
my name's Ken
and um
you're in Texas right
everybody's in Texas God okay
i'm in Rochester New York everybody else but one has been in Texas
okay well i guess we should get on with this um did you get the message about what it was right yeah okay go great let me just hit the button
[noise]
okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us
yeah that's interesting i don't i- i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore
i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein
who's our biggest threat but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just
it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there
right
but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them
huh
that's
yeah uh
yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of
for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but
yeah actually i noticed that i mean th- th- this this most recent scam of his where he said
where where he just decided that instead of having uh
instead of having
i c- i can't think of the word now um
if they're having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether
so i- i- i think that he he he's actually he i think is becoming very dangerous
because he's making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making
um the military angry at him i mean i've heard stories now where the
where the um the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know with with the Baltic States when they just go in there
to beat people up
um-hum
that's interesting
i- i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems
the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb [laughter] i don't know though
that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so
yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i- i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but
it could be real dangerous
yeah right we don't need to worry about them
yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else
yes
well i don't i don't know i think that un- un- underlying we're all pretty
probably not as as different as everybody thinks
right well that's that's certainly true i just
that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls
as a matter of fact about um
another topic but it came up under these um
this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something
you've read that one before
that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to
the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share
and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other
you know and and that would be all and if we could just do the same thing
sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine
yeah unfortunately
because because i often i often sort of wonder how
having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know h- how mu- everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the
[laughter] yeah
right
i would i would love to go there i mean like a- again not now but at some point to go see what what i mean what this is like i mean this this is amazing because this is
this is an an i mean this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch
yeah that's that's and and the ones they even feel
somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States
where they don't have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia
but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago
and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and
you be this way
uh i- i think it's a sad state of affairs but
oh yeah the yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah well that yeah and that
um um [vocalized-noise] actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece
and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with
as well as Saddam Hussein i- i mean i think their big problem up there is that they you know is unfortunately not only are they
th- there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land
um-hum
yes yes
um-hum um actually uh my wife is Syrian
um so i- i also i know some of the history and so forth
and and the actually the real funny thing is that i'm i'm i'm Jewish we're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves
so we i- i know that and i've been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very
lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it's the same thing i it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are
you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly
i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it
so i could put the
that's that's certainly true
right um
i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that so at least
that's poss-
hello hi
hi Ken my name's Diane
yes i'm in San Antonio
[laughter]
oh
okay
yes
[noise]
i think they'll always represent a threat wheth-
whether or not there's an active cold war or not
uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities
and
uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat
probably not no
right
um-hum and it's and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them and and the great powers are always pitted against each other
i don't know [laughter] they they're going downhill pretty steady
but i- i agree right now they're not i don't believe they're a large threat right now i think there's always some threat
yeah
actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting
things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his
own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring
i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah we've got our own worries at the moment so
i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us
well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think
given the the uh the differences in the world and people are just too different
but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful
they just see that
this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe wipe him out
um-hum
uh-huh
no i haven't read it i've heard all about it though
yeah
yes but people grow up and they forget
that's one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and
to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know
what things were like
so
yeah i and i the the people i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't
[vocalized-noise] th- i mean they they can't do any they can't change it they try and they
there's nothing that they can do
um-hum
yeah
yeah
it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the
i'm trying to think of the name of the the [vocalized-noise] something like that in Northern Iraq
who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually
they they don't they're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries
and and they're very dissatisfied and they're they're causing wars right now and
and i don't think it's that different from what the Baltic States are are going through
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
the the one that i think
one of the wom- women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are
probably ten cultures of people and and that's they don't all have their own country and and some of them are mad about it
oh
oh huh uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah and i- and i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different i really don't
i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs
they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here
to to esc-
[noise]
okay i think the crime in Dallas is horrendous
[noise] compared now to when i f- came here twenty years ago when i came here twenty years ago it was not near as bad as it is now it's terrible now my house has already been broken into once and there was an attempt
a s- another time i mean i can't it's horrible i'm afraid
no i live well i live in Oak Cliff but uh
uh we never had any problem here before we we really did not in my neighborhood we're not wealthy at all kn- you know we don't have a rich neighborhood and when they break into our houses they don't get anything
much they get a little jewelry and maybe you know a VCR's and it just irritates me to no end that somebody has broken into my house and stolen my things you know just
[laughter]
[noise]
no i had- i hadn't heard that
are you serious [laughter] that is the ci-
that sounds like the city i worked for the city of Dallas for a while and i do know that they're they can be really strange
[noise] drugs they want t- see they take what they do they break in and they take your jewelry and they take it and they sell it they hock it and then they buy drugs i really think it's drugs they want the money for the drugs
so i think drugs is the root of it
well okay i used to work second shift and when they broke in i was working at night i i work in payroll now and i work days but uh they broke in
they knew my hours the police told me evidently they were watching me and they know your hours see that's what so spooky about it
[noise]
and they broke in at night and uh since then i've put in a security light and i've marked everything i you know that i have i
put my driver's license number on it ugly too i mean where it could be seen because i don't care d- i just don't want them to get it and hock it again
[noise]
no not right here i i have never even seen like uh what they call a crack house or anything i wouldn't
no there's nothing like that here that i know of now i'm sure there are somewhere in Oak Cliff but i've never seen it we're not in a bad area you know i
they've hit they've hit my next door neighbor they hit uh the guy about two or three houses down so they've hit several houses in the neighborhood one of them twice
they're just looking
just something they kicked my door in they literall- i had a solid wooden door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it and kicked it in molding and all
that's real scary
i have a and i my insurance [noise] paid to have the contractor come out and i we put in a -nother solid door and another dead bolt but it doesn't hold it
so does mine now this one does have glass in it
[noise]
uh i don't think there is a solution i i really
i really don't know i really do- and you know the police told me to get a gun and if they if you're here and they try breaking in shoot them now i have never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before
but that tells you how bad the situation is that tells you how bad it is and there aren't enough police and they they didn't get here till six the next morning i got home at eleven called the police immediately
several times my neighbors came over immediately we didn't even know if they were still in the house my neighbor went through looking
they advised on the phone that we'll have somebody go through and look now that's terrible and the police did not get here until seven hours later
that's darn scary
if it's possible i guess i well or is it is it or is the solution legalizing
somethings
if you legalize it i- uh well you couldn't legalize everything okay i just don't see that you could but if you legalized marijuana
and then uh taxed it and everything then everybody'd come out okay i think on that deal
i don't even know i really don't know
hard drug users
yeah
and then the thing is keeping them locked up
you know they pick them up they lock them up and then they they let them go
they don't have anything to kee- and you never get your stuff back you never get your stuff back
[noise]
that's right
and they think these are k- k- are probably teenagers older teenagers that have been doing this around here
they uh they weren't real profe- well we don't know for sure but they hit they took they knew right where to go that's what scares me
they went they went right to my jewelry they did not ransack my house they went right to my jewelry box and i had a ring that had my diamonds in it and my grandmother's diamonds in it that i had made and it was worth close to two thousand dollars
they go- and they i mean they had pay dirt when they saw that i mean and i c- i worked in the shop then at TI you you know with machinery and i couldn't wear my jewelry i can wear it now i wear everything
i don't leave anything home i wear everything [laughter] you bet [laughter] but uh
they got that and the diamond necklace and stuff so they really hit pay dirt and then they grabbed my VCR also but they didn't just tear it out they very carefully unhooked everything laid everything out you know i mean it was just unbelievable
no they left two TV's and one was small they could have easily carried it but the police said they must have been on foot it looked like they were on foot they left my silver my silver was sitting here in a chest
well i did [laughter]
[noise]
yeah yeah
[noise]
well they can they can
no well they can hock it see they take everything to the pawn shops and just hock everything but um
i don't know they just hit the jewel- well i guess if they knew their jewelry they knew the- but they did take some cubic zirconiums too i had a ring that they looked awfully real
and i did have a ring that that wasn't real and they took that you know and i said
they just grabbed
they just grabbed but boy they sure hit pay dirt with that one ring luckily my insurance you know reimbursed me but i can't replace those diamonds
you know
to have and that had my grandmother's stones in it you know so oh i was sick
but i still haven't bought a gun
[noise]
co- compared to what
do you live in do you live near downtown
w-
[noise]
hum well i live i i live in in north
west Garland actually w- about a mile south of one ninety so we're really quite far north and the house we just moved into a house that has lots of windows and i course i have a f- Dallas policeman that lives right behind me so i don't know if that'll do any good but
uh it it's interesting though that you've been broken into uh you must you must look at this whole mess a lot different did you see today that they the the police commanders got a pay raise and the the regular folks didn't
it just on the news i was just watching a little of it just
before you called it uh and they cut- and they cutback on overtime and they have to take electric clocks home and you wonder what that does to the fighting crime i- if they had an electric clock on their desk they were supposed to take it home to save energy
[laughter] i'm serious [vocalized-noise] uh Doug Clark's on channel eight
what what what do you think why why people breaking into your house
hum
what time of day are they breaking in
uh
yeah
well are you uh you said you're not in a in a rich neighborhood but are there are there obviously um
drug people in the area
do you think they just kind of hit your house at random or but they were going down the street
so they
okay so they're really just looking for
a nice enough house to find something to steal
oh that's scary because everybody feels you're supposed to have dead bolts
well my the front door on the house i have has uh glass in it
well i- i wonder you know you know it i don't know this is tough but i guess the issue is is if it's drug people what's the solution
well that
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well that that's real scary
but is the is the solution uh cutting off drug supply
o-
or is it
yeah or yeah uh do you see that these people you know are they going to if if you cut supply it's going to raise the price
or if you uh
well how how expensive is um how expensive is marijuana it's not very expensive is it
but i mean the people that are i'd be curious to if the people that are wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably
are probably crack that have got a pretty high because i would think a hundred dollars worth of marijuana i don't know what it costs but
i should think that'd be more than [laughter] a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them up for you know
yeah
but they don't have enough proof [vocalized-noise] them
and then we got to rai-
well we had interesting enough we had a in in Garland before we moved we had some neighborhood kids came by and stole uh uh drill and our saw and and i had them marked and uh
we called the police about a week later the guy caught these kids riding a m- um
a motor scooter or a a go it was a go-cart in the in the alley
and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it it's one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood
uh but it's it's interesting that the the motivation and the question is what's the motivation not to steal and i i guess that's what bothers it's like the criminal you know if somebody says well let's lock him up for life well
how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that he's if you if you know you're going to be in there for life why should you just be good
but if you if you say i'm not going to let you out till you have a skill and we think you're reformed well that's not how they do it they let them out when they time is served i
i i guess the problem is is is what it would take to do that would be more money than we it's like the school issue and which i guess we're not supposed to talk to but anyway the idea of how much money would it take to reform these criminals and lock them all up
hum
in your
oh my
yeah
yeah
[laughter] everything of value
well did they did you take your TV
yeah but who buys silver anymore
well yeah but have you bought a place setting la- i have a niece that's getting married
and uh she's not even um selecting a silver pattern because it's i've forgotten my wife was telling me what the cost is just incredible to you know a place setting is is
i don't know two or three hundred dollars or something i mean your silver probably is worth a lot but uh what are they going to do walk down the street and tell everybody what would you like to buy uh a [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
well how would they know i mean they they'd have to be pretty sophisticated
no and and and yeah how to put a value on a ring that you'd made
yeah
that is scary
well see that's the thing scares me about it is um who gets shot with the guns they say that a large number of the homicides are people that know each other
that uh i've forgot what the per- forty or fifty percent it's surprisingly high that people that shoot each other know them i mean it's not like you know a [vocalized-noise]
do you have any pets
you must have a little farm then
well i'm a i'm a sort of a city dweller and i got a bunch of kids so they've got to have their pets
and uh we've uh lost a few this year but we've still got a dog and a bird left
and uh
the the kids maul the dog something awful they pull his tail and bend his ears and uh
have a good time playing with him and the dog is pretty uh tolerant of them
well they're uh seven eight and uh ten
and
yes well right outside in uh Falls Church Virginia
yeah
uh-huh
well you've got part of your family up here then
yeah
well uh i just got a new bird for uh little Deb at uh Christmas time and we're still in the process of uh getting him tamed he's a little parakeet yellow one
and uh we let him fly around the house
and the dog being a Golden Retriever he he pays close attention whenever that bird is flying around
well the the previous bird he uh got a hold of it uh two or three times
and uh
i found that uh well one occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the dog walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth
and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a dog's tail real hard he lets go of a bird [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah [vocalized-noise]
bigger bird or a larger cat to take care of the dog [laughter]
uh-huh
well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets
and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds
so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth
knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet
uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me
and it lived to be a a pretty old bird
and was extremely friendly
uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time
uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop
and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders
yeah
uh-huh
well we found in general when you you look for breeders you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas
they you wind up going many miles out of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for
we went looking for uh rabbits
and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back
weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops
and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking
uh-huh
yeah
huh
yeah
that's pretty unusual because w- i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents
uh-huh
yeah we had a rabbit up until uh last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits
uh
i uh we we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh Mister Tibbar
and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards
so uh
one of my other daughters got a uh gerbil and they came to me for a name and i said well name him Libreg
and they said well how did you get that name i said well that's gerbil spelled backwards
well they wouldn't let me name the dog
[laughter]
well
yeah well we had uh i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm cats on the property
and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them
but uh one of the cats which we named Bug Eyes she had a litter of kittens and she kept them away from the uh the house until they were pretty good size kittens
and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them
and one day i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw [laughter]
yeah
but i tried again a few weeks later but this time i put on some leather gloves
and my father still wondered what happened to those leather gloves
[laughter]
well it's been nice talking to you
all right
bye
[noise]
uh right now i have um uh two longhair miniature dachshunds
i also raise uh peacocks ducks i have three different kinds of ducks and i raise geese and rabbits
but the uh uh the dogs and the peacocks are pets the rest of them we we do those for food
yeah yeah we live out in the country
so what do you have
uh-huh
yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids
huh you said your from DC
I have
oh okay i have a
m- my i have a daughter i think she's in Spring Field i'm not sure she's around there somewhere she just got her a new apartment
and my other daughter and son-in-law live in Germantown
so
there
yeah yeah so it's
interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity
yeah
i wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him though
oh oh
[laughter]
next time you'll have to try a bigger bird
[laughter]
we have some friends that in fact the ones that we bought one of the dogs from they also raise birds and they have uh
two or three different kinds of of parrots and then they raise finches and parakeets and they show
and he and he was showing me his parakeets and and he calls them an English parakeet and he said their marking is a little different
have did did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets
yeah
you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there
that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our
county that now have aviaries
one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now
i know
uh-huh
yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too
yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck
and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her
the uh
we go we had uh one doe that we'd had
her
let's see it was her second litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three
uh babies and we raised those and then her second litter
she wound up killing all of them
and it took her like three days i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her
so i i
wouldn't tolerate that
yeah well this is the first time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had
gone from having one buck and and three does down to one buck and just one doe
but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up
[laughter]
[laughter]
now that's a good idea
no that one would might get you in trouble
yeah unless you called it Dog [laughter]
we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild cats out there in our general vicinity
and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so
you know those are just Big Cat and Little Cat
huh
[noise]
i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn
and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a
uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick
[laughter]
did you in
well it's been very nice talking to you i appreciate having the call
and uh maybe we'll speak again on this little test that they're trying to do
okay thank you bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
i've uh as far as i'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much
because they have become more aggressive and more dominating and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now
i would like uh yes i have worked outside of the home and i was in one of those safe occupations i was a school teacher
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career
uh we uh then i stopped teaching after my husband's bus- business was established and we had two children and i stayed home with those children and
raised those children and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching which
if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering because your fighting for your life but i am a fighter and i've always been a disciplinarian
uh i'm i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply i think they're going in by choice
yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the male needs to be the dominant person
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen they are very aggressive
they're uh they almost have what i would call a killer -ee killer bee instinct
and they have to be in charge and and i th- i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands
uh-huh
oh sure
[laughter]
uh-huh
hum
huh
uh-huh
if my wife had an education and could support us and the only value i see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents because
i see my sons-in-law i have a daughter who's a nurse and i have a daughter who's a beautician and i see my sons-in-law cooking
and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and
and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did because he left home at five thirty in the morning and he got home at six fifteen
and uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted
so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent and i think that's an advantage
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
and i think it's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father and and i don't think you
we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there
but uh i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and
and drive those big trucks and we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles and at one point we sat down
uh i didn't realize it but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only and here's this young girl
with the tattoos and she w- has just had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona and she'd been
and i ask her how old she was and she was the a- between the age of our daughters
and she had been driving a truck for seven years and i thought gosh
i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life style when
i guess i'm s- i'm a maybe Victorian and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist in that
he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote
now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things too but
uh i like being taken care of i like my luggage carried and my door opened and i think the young women are losing that and i think that's sad
he was raised in the south i think that's a little war condition [laughter] both
uh-huh huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i think a lot of my problem with the young mothers i-
um
all right
uh-huh
oh well i tend i tend to agree uh in some ways i think it's uh i think if anything a lot of um [noise]
the changes that have occurred um in some ways they're for the better because i think women should have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life but by the same token
and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not [laughter] worked
um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that
it it m- it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with
with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um
that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um
so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see
yes
uh-huh
uh-huh [noise]
yes
yes
right
but yeah
oh i be- i think so yes
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the
one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society
that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working
and i was a an engineer so i was always with men
uh and they were single many of them and i tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when i leave at i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night and they had
they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea
[noise] what was involved once i got home now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything
um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected
and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society and there's a lot of truth to that and i don't know how you feel i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but i can see with the younger men
that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like
i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us
um-hum
yeah
right
uh-huh
right
right right
uh-huh
that's true
that's true
yes
right
and they enjoy it
yeah and they do enjoy it i i see you're right i see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children and i think that is healthy because ch-
right oh yeah
yes
yeah
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
oh boy [laughter]
yeah
well it
well that that's true there is that part too and i guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know [laughter] anybody else um i guess ha-
oh oh yeah and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way and
and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served
and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear now my husband is
um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are
very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet [noise]
um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility
um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more thank you i'm kind of more middle
of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time
but i think it's um [noise]
i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think they're downstairs Aaron i think that's very um
unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week i refused to work more than thirty i was part-time and even that was a rat race but
i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and an- i'm away and uh
so i think you can have both it's more hectic but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then
hi Ellen
um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses
[laughter]
yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term
uh yeah
okay that's uh uh we used to budget when the children were small
um
things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing
and our savings weren't that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh
finally getting out of college this uh May
so we've we don't budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what you're going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed
um as far as electricity and telephone and
um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal
for retirement you know
they take out for CODA and then uh um
the IRA's
and then uh i also take out for
um a savings account but it's it's uh
[noise]
um it's not really sa- it's savings if we don't spend it
it's like a floating you know if something if something comes up
yes
right yeah
it it
it doesn't come out um
it doesn't come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now i'm getting up towards retirement age so
we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and we're going maxed out on CODA and then
you know other things like you know CD's
um
but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend
that's what we hit
or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant
um that'll come out of that
rather than put it on a credit card
right
yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um
[noise]
yeah
right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever
but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you
because you suffer a penalty
so that's yeah that's one of the that's one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA
so
that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with
i mean that's fantastic
you know they match it um
my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a couple of years her father took sick so she's been taking care of him
but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers
steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just
piles up
um yeah we we took out actually my wife
she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up [noise] so much went for groceries
[noise]
so much went for the mortgage because we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil
we heated with oil [noise]
we they put us on a budget they would run like uh [vocalized-noise] they could really tell how much oil you were going to use
so they budgeted it at year round
so in the summer time
which you didn't use very little oil
you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out
and
we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often
but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it
it it became a chore
yeah i talked to to uh
[noise]
other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that
we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account
and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close
so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries
um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh
course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now
and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed
you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay
so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it
as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank
so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine
so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore
yeah i i walk around sometimes and i've got if i've got five dollars in my pocket that's that's a lot it's
yeah for your automobile
you mean gas [vocalized-noise] yeah and now i don't know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month
so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go
so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore
yeah yeah it's not bad so you don't need you don't need money for gasoline you don't need money you know incidentals
uh
for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that
um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society
because if you're doing that
you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas
um and we're doing it m- most of the people up here that work ha- already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union
so they don't deal much in cash anymore either
so it looks like we're both running about the same
um
maybe younger people are different i'm not sure
uh
they don't have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know
[vocalized-noise] i look at mine and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because
things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes
still because you guys ran into it a while back
uh
oh yeah it's not just yeah it's not just TI they they're doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterday's newspaper they said um IBM's going through they're going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide
[noise]
So it's still there unfortunately um
hi
no we don't really do anything formal um
i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and
i just sort of know what we can and can't do and
it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really gotten into any major problems without having something formal
well yeah
yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit union account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh we've got you know the IRA's and CD's and
various and sundry you know long term kinds of things
how about you
um-hum
uh
right
um-hum
right
[laughter] well i know yeah
yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but that's where you get the money is
yeah that's that's the way we work it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that
you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is
yeah no i never g- like to go into those things that are
like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they
uh [vocalized-noise] i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you don't use it and you sort of don't see it then it's it's safe in a sense
yeah
yeah
yes
definitely i mean that's a good deal
i don't know
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah that's a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that
yeah
yeah
[laughter] we-
yeah
yeah i do that too
yeah
[laughter]
yeah i used to take money out for gas and groceries and things like that and i don't even do that anymore i mean i just don't have that much cash on me
um-hum right
yeah
yeah
works pretty good then
yeah to some extent i guess so
yeah
well
if we
yeah
yeah they probably don't have enough to [laughter] that's right
yeah we we're having some problems here too
yeah they're still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there
well yeah that really is scary
all right
uh-huh
yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means
yep
yeah prob- you're probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long
that's right that
that would be the problem
sure would
um-hum
um-hum
yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it
uh you know college credit you know something you know i'm not sure what but i-
i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service
but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea
i'm not either really
that's right that's right
uh-huh
that's right absolutely then you'll you'll
young families whatever they jus- they just couldn't you know take off to do that
only
that's right um-hum
um-hum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think
um-hum
yep
yep
that's right i'm not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah [noise]
like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city
yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know an- go somewhere half way around the world or something
that's right
yeah that's that's true too that's true too bu-
yeah
yeah me either and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know
just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind
yep it's tough it's tough
yeah
yeah
i'm i'm not sure either
but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know
yeah
um-hum yeah
yep that's right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
that's right
yeah that's a real waste too it really is
i don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the Carter administration that was that was a big thing with him
and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of f- i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that
b- i just don't hear much about it anymore like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know
anyway it's a tough question really is you know
okay well thanks for your time enjoyed talking to you okay take care bye bye
[noise]
okay
um
i i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be
to go into public service i think
yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest tha-
yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're gonna be serving anybody
yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing
to get out there and do so
yeah
right right college credit is a good idea because
right
that's right yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giv- giving some kind of college credit
uh-huh
no i don't think so either because a lot of people um [vocalized-noise] depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not -at that familiar with them to know
but you know if [vocalized-noise] a lot of people flat can't afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time
so it's it's a really tough question
that's right
yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that's that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because they just wanna get on
yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i- i think it can't be something that's mandatory it has to be something that's voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might
yeah and -at's the other thing is that [vocalized-noise] you know instead of making it mandatory they may- maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and
do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it
yeah in their own community right
yeah that's true [laughter] most of them probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents
[laughter] but they would have to be supportive in some way and i'm not sure those those programs are available to do that
right
right exactly that's
yeah it is tough it's a- and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do
yeah
yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them you know it'd be it it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that
you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them all in the auditorium and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and
and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything
yeah it is it really is
right yeah
yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
i don't either [laughter]
that's what
yeah it is a tough question
[noise]
sure same here ta- you too [noise] bye-bye [noise]
hi Debbie how are you
what do you think of this weather
oh i love it
yeah
yes you can hear her huh [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah i have a four year old and a one year old
so uh yeah i'm glad it was nice too i
got a chance to to go outside and
just have a nice day
the um i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything
i'm glad we don't have that this year so far
uh-huh
we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know
quite a lot um it's not it doesn't usually damage any businesses or anything but you can't get off of thirty five to um
to go to Home Depot and that's a problem [laughter]
[laughter]
yes [laughter]
or Target for that matter now
uh-huh
oh yeah
yeah we're not from Texas either um
we're i grew up in Pennsylvania so
yeah it it's not like this in Pennsylvania
it's awfully hot [noise]
yeah
oh you're kidding
sure
oh i'm sure
i- i think you would probably
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
down here yeah i'd j- i think it's a necessity
we um
we have
i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that's where we we moved from and uh
so we [vocalized-noise] we had a feeling we'd be coming back this way and again there they don't sell all the cars with air conditioning it's you know it's really a not
it's almost a luxury
we didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything
oh
yes it does
[noise]
no i don't think so either no
oh no we didn't even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms
no isn't that surprising [noise]
[noise]
uh-huh
oh
oh my gosh
[laughter]
well you know we lived in Colorado for
four years i guess
so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i- i really don't miss that
my husband says he certainly doesn't mind
sh- missing the shoveling i mea- we had a big sidewalk and [laughter] he didn't like that at all but
i don't know
yeah oh definitely
uh-huh
[noise]
that's right
it doesn't matter right
Colorado wasn't bad for that because um it is so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time
that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day
and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard
the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal
yeah yeah
really
that's
good [laughter] they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately
[noise] that's true [laughter] certainly not localized there
[laughter]
but we i don't know i- i- i- i don't really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself
the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania
yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess [laughter]
nothing pretty about it
um-hum
my folks don't live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October
just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time
uh-huh
it really is and i think you don't
i growing up there i just assumed that's how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local
thing i
yeah
nope
yeah they they do [laughter]
yeah i do too i'm ready to
get outside and get the kids outside and [laughter]
seems to j- even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and
put her outside and hey she's fine
um-hum
my my son b- he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um
he was three i guess just turned three
and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July
and he was lethargic he really he wasn't used to the heat at all he
would go outside and he'd turn into a zombie [laughter] and walk around like he didn't know what was going on but he's used to it now i think he's i mean
he certainly doesn't like the heat but he doesn't become lethargic anymore
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
that's a good word for it [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
really hot
[laughter]
well it's been good talking to you
hopefully we'll have some more good weather but
we'll see
[laughter]
all righty bye-bye
[noise]
oh just fine
oh it's been beautiful here lately
yeah i was i was glad that Easter was nice because sounds like you have a child too [laughter]
yeah i've i've got a two year old and we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice
um-hum
we had a
yeah
[noise]
it was raining last year we had
uh-huh we
oh oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down uh
[vocalized-noise] south of downtown all those people got flooded out
oh
did it
oh really
i did
[laughter] yeah oh gosh yes uh the [laughter] a lot of people go there
yeah
i'm i'm we're not from Texas we're from further we're from Missouri so it's it's
[vocalized-noise] the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home [laughter] yeah
oh so you're really [laughter]
no i like the winters but i don't like the summers down here it
it's terribly hot in the summer here i just
when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didn't have an air conditioner
i'm not well we didn't well [vocalized-noise] we really [vocalized-noise] really don't need it very much in Missouri where we're from
but um oh we suffered that first summer we traded that thing in [laughter] as as soon as we could because it just it's indispensable down here to have air conditioning
it would be terrible
um-hum
oh
yeah
it's
oh it is you know uh
oh yeah that would be nice oh i- i get the the our electric bill in here July and August is just about kills me it's because it's so hot
because i don't think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really don't
because of the wi- winters i kind of miss winter
since it it didn't do anything down here this winter
no we didn't no we didn't did we
that was that is surprising
and i- i it was uh really odd
but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i- we had well we ran into town and in the ice
as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot
[laughter] so we got our fill we went home at Christmas [laughter]
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah
i'd rather have the snow than the ice
because in Missouri we have a we have a lot of ice
and snow but uh but the the ice is really bad
because it knocks out power lines and and you just you just absol- least at when you've got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles
so the ice you know that's that's a whole
you d- you don't need a four wheel drive vehicle you sit and spin [laughter] uh
uh-huh
that's a
yeah
that'd be nice
did you all work at TI uh
TI Colorado Springs
oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husband's old group that moved out there
yeah
and they're still they're still out there though uh
[laughter]
did oh they're they are everywhere they
[laughter] no
yes uh-huh
it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here
[laughter]
no it j- the the trees just go to about the first of December and then just oh well it's time to die so it just it's just an ugly mess
yeah
yeah my grand
my grandparents took a tour of the oh of the northeast this past Fall and they really enjoyed it they said the [vocalized-noise] c- color was just fantastic
this year
well yeah
yeah
well the maple tree the map- maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color
which there are none down here
it's too hot for them
we have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but uh the northeast really has the
corner on that [laughter]
on the on the real nice color
but uh i- i like spring i like i like the reason it's i like that spring comes
quickly here [laughter]
yes uh yes
oh
oh definitely
oh my m- my two year old she hates to be p- in indoors anyway and just
well i think long winters would really mess up mess her up [laughter] uh
um-hum
oh whew
yeah
yeah
huh-uh
i know
yeah well when we moved down here it was it was June and and it was just like a shock
how oh being it's just so much different
i mean the heat when it gets hot in Missouri it it it [noise] it'll get hot for a couple of days
in the in the in the mid to upper nineties and people think it's terrible and then it [vocalized-noise] and it always just goes away
it just i just couldn't it was just oppressive the heat down here
and i just couldn't
um [laughter] make my family understand this is hot
[laughter] uh
so
well nice talking to you too
oh yeah [laughter]
[laughter] okay take it easy bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
the topic is how we can h-
how what is our
and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling
well it is to me uh because
we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh
papers that we accumulate and recycle and
Plano Texas
yes they certainly do they certainly do
where are you
oh i see
well our libraries and then the uh Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them and when you recycle glass
that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans
so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not
sure well you know we haul it off i- once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill
well this is Texas it doesn't set it blows
give
lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about
and we have somebody else's but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know
if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management
it will happen
what upsets me uh there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches
and they are s- our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States
and it's not because of litter it's because of boats
the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling
vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches
and it kills some of our animals
there's there's a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility
at Port Aransas
and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic
it's horrible it's a gross collection
um-hum
yes whatever those thi- nasty things are
that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow
or drowned
yeah
terrific
well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic
and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful
well they're suppose to h- be working t- around that
uh-huh
oh really
sure so
trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry
oh
oh that's just sickening
[noise]
well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridley's turtle
that's on the Texas Gulf Coast
and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through
huge fight going on
uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do [laughter] this makes sense to us we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point
i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem
so it's it's really a hard hard issue to say what's right and what's not
oh this is
like they raise catfish now
well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money
we have a lot of Vietnamese
fisher people
and ye- they support their whole family on less than than i'd had for lunch
anyway
and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that
and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that
that they it would have to be government owned or s- financed if not controlled
there because the financing simply isn't there
because it's one of those cottage industries that uh
the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change
sure
well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know
probably are probably are
well they may do it
whether they like it or not they may do it you know
y- that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with the poor turtles [laughter]
well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous
but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it
so it's no telling what the turtle really taste like
well it maybe it wasn't you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous
great sure it is
charge fifteen keep moving
as long as it's French
[laughter]
oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves
you need clout
it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing
you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that
calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp
and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest
yeah that's exactly it
and there's no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money
that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot
we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type
which
[laughter]
gee
right
[noise]
community doing on recycling
yeah [laughter] sounds like an exciting one
wh- where do you live
do they have the uh collection points where you can oh okay
yes we're we're really behind the times here about all we've got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans uh North Carolina
um i b- i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them i don't drink Cokes or anything like that so i don't don't usually get any aluminum cans
but that's that's all they've got set up they've got a uh central collection point at the JC Park and uh that's it
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah and you and you a- and you also get rid of it so
oh yeah yeah that's why i just let it sit there and let it uh let it uh rot away and it's a good fertilizer
oh [laughter] that's right
surprised you even have grass there [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
uh
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
exactly
hum
um-hum
hum
yeah i've seen i've seen pictures of uh seals that have gotten uh gotten their necks stuck in those uh plastic uh
oh what do you call them they hold six packs together those plast-
yeah because they they're they're playful and they think this is fun we'll stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they can't get out and they strangle
and i
or they starve because they can't eat
yeah i mean it's that's yeah that's that's terrible i mean i like seals
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's what it bothers me the same thing about uh netting tuna they they get so many dolphins
and
and i
well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago
i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them to be absolute liars
yeah because you know people like Starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people
and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now
sure
that's right trust us
yeah they had some they had some uh
uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins
and they killed probably half of them
yeah it is i like dolphins too
um-hum
um-hum
um right right
um-hum
well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming
i mean th- there's i- i don't see any reason why they can't uh i mean there's a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp
jus- just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy
and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area
um-hum
yeah
r- right
on fishing yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah well it's
um-hum
yeah
yeah and
yeah is right yeah they're they're they're in it for a matter of survival not
not environmentalist
oh yeah they they probably are i
of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them they might as well eat the turtles too and
they probably do i mean [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
oh turtle is good
yeah
yeah
yeah i had turtle when i was in Vietnam didn't know it was turtle at the time because i wouldn't have eaten it but
yeah i
yeah [laughter] that's true
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
well hopefully it's real turtle too [laughter]
yeah you well that's that's the other thing i mean you never know what they're putting in there you know [laughter] oh this is turtle soup you know okay
sure right
yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it
it's probably it's probably Campbells or something [laughter]
no i i n- no i don't think we will because you nee- you need some kind of organization for it and
yeah and the prob- the problem i mean we've got all these environmental organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's the the end results is is just a nullity nobody's getting anything done
and and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay here's a problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just
um-hum
yeah well that's wha- that's what i mean about all these groups they're so
yeah they're so uh
they
yeah i mean w- i mean you'd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and and
and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group
[vocalized-noise] j- they just don't get anywhere
that's right that's right
um-hum
exactly
yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work
i mean we we've been at this for for so many years now and ju- and just and nothing's happening
so what do you think about a year or two of public service
uh-huh
yes yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
you know i- i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach
to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from a nice
middle class white suburban home and i did it um
for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed
it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me
and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i- i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about
doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back
um be- so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans
i- i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old
um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed
uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church
that does that um-hum because one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said
to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me
um-hum
um-hum
yes
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i- i think i was paid
uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i- i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids
um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors
and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty
and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities
for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um
things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i- i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
right um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i think it would also help them if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um
uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious [vocalized-noise]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that's true
um-hum that's right
i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic
uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough
uh you know
um-hum
yep that's true
um-hum
oh i think it is
i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students
and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um [laughter] their self-centeredness
and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand
um-hum
yep i think that's uh j- just having a good time
i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented [vocalized-noise] i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it
you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun
um-hum yeah
well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the uh funding for the Peace Corps
uh-huh because i guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe
uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh
um-hum
um-hum
yes yeah that's true
um-hum
yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i- i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington
area are lawyers
and and i- i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with
you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know
[laughter]
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah that's true
that's interesting um-hum
okay hey thanks so much for the conversation
well thank you very much bye-bye
[noise]
well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know their [vocalized-noise] carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland um
they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um
the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i be- i really believe that the people that do that
are better people and uh make our society better
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh
hm
[laughter]
yeah
hm
yes yes but if
uh-huh
uh-huh
well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um
there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of
kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um
thinking less of your own needs but of other people
um-hum
uh-huh
oh no
um-hum
right
um-hum
yes
it would really um and i don't [laughter] the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still
they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want
m- mil- to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature [vocalized-noise] than the average student and
um-hum
well that's right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just
are so excited to be away from home that they just spend all their time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and
um
yeah
um-hum
be- because we're so
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice
and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and
of course we think it's helping other people and so
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
and they're preoccupied with drinking
uh-huh and
[laughter]
um-hum
that's true
that's really true
yes well i- i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um
oh really
um-hum
hm
well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with
what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money
and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash
um-hum
area yes
yes there's too many people
um-hum
that's right and not enough people want to do that to for
uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich
um-hum
that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go
well good luck to you i enjoyed it
thanks bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment
uh-huh
what kind of business is it
uh-huh
well that sounds interest- that sounds fun [laughter] what kind of business is it
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
well that's interesting
a what
oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i'll i'm not really into it i don't know the infor- i don't know that much about it so anyway but well that's interesting i personally i like mostly
um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it's like life is to interesting to read fiction but
i always get books like um i like to quilt well i'm not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but
i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff
and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i'm a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i li- i have a real heart for people involved in cults
and so i have a real you know heart for them and [laughter] i'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that's just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and
and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and
i read the Bible i don't read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading
but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him [laughter] but um i don't know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um
uh-huh
thirty or younger
is that what you said
oh ten years younger oh that's funny
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc
so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know [laughter] to kill a horse probably [laughter] i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway [laughter] i did read one chapter of that [laughter]
uh-huh
no i haven't
uh-huh
the quantities and
what's the name of it again
Life Extension
um-hum
uh-huh oh really
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
really
um-hum
oh really
really
i know there's not any food that you can get
and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my [vocalized-noise] my husband's uncle owns a bi- um some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas
and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but
i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all
be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but
i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be
but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but
i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just
i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think
i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the
you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and
you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so
uh-huh
uh-huh
because it's what
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
um
really
really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that
and um i've all my relatives my m- you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don't know [vocalized-noise] we read a lot i know people have read all those books but
the um they dr- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be
and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it's they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it's not real developed and so they have a [vocalized-noise] probably half an acre
and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so [laughter] it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that
uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related
or self improvement um i've got a a uh small company on the side
that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh
important issues such as a you know taxes and
business expenses and all those kind things
[laughter]
um i've got a uh small distributorship uh i uh
sell a uh
healthy cookie on the side
and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the ma- from the supplier
and then i distributed them and then i ca- i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i've got a uh drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done
a drinking water business uh yeah [vocalized-noise] yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] sounds like it
uh-huh
um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger
and uh had
[laughter]
about ten years younger yeah
and um uh th- the problem that i've i've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um i've
tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it i've been moderately successful
uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um
i have some books on on health that i read all the time one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i'm
uh-huh
there's a uh a couple called um oh i'm going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson
um and uh there's a book called Life Extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it
okay it's a book called Life Extensions there's also a book called The Life Extansion Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and
oh i forgot Sally's last name
anyway it's a couple i've i've seen them on TV
and uh they ha- they are pretty down to earth about uh
what you can take and and what you can't take and um
the quantities what are good for you what isn't and um Life Extensions
uh yeah he's probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show
and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs
you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run
and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old
and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age
and of course Sally uh isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S
and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises
uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
yes
yeah there's i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have
um for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you
through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer
they know that they've proven that
um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've i've read books that
uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack
and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty
and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water
uh-huh
yeah i'm very familiar with the area
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the
[noise]
okay um what do you think about the war recently
uh-huh
uh
the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything
yeah yeah
that's the first thing i thought of i don't know
right
right
right and
i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam
that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably
and now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate
ex-
exactly exactly
oh torn apart oh yeah
um-hum
right
so it that's also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did
oh okay
um-hum
exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes
um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do
is higher you know
and they just raised the minimum wage today but that's not like you know
as much as they should have raised it i'm sure
but uh
uh-huh
right
right right
uh-huh yeah
i don't i don't have any children or anything right now i'm uh i work as a
news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but
uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so
it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me
you know what's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something
yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything
so that was pretty interesting
yeah
exactly be everything be supermom exactly
uh-huh
right and
where as it would have been exactly um
right the roles are changing a lot
uh-huh
right
and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now
kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies
and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women
uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now
you know since the women's movement in the we- seventies and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still [vocalized-noise] good ways to go
so
uh-huh [noise]
right
yeah
exactly
exactly
it's just not as
exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still
and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people
you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you
but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even and that you don't even see or know about
oh oh yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
[laughter] yeah
yeah
i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because i'm Black and so you know i lived that's where i lived
and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone i've i went to UT to college and so they you know they have
a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don't get to see
exactly and that
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] exactly
it is
oh my gosh
well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that's great my sister was telling me
she met a gi- she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think
Barbados or Jamaica or something like that
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and
you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness
you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that
but
oh yeah
uh-huh
they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just
yeah that's ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school
you know and i couldn't and i just couldn't
believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a ca- yeah
exactly and if you had a car [vocalized-noise] there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it's just
you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn't understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car
so that was
[laughter] yeah yeah ri-
really or live really close to school and have them walk
but uh yeah a lot of changes
so
i think so [laughter]
okay well it's good it's good talking to you okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay
the war you mean in terms of the economy or
[vocalized-noise]
oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes
is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well [laughter] um
well i think it's caused a lot of you know
big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that
you know and support the soldiers so
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something
yeah it i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income
just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and
i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds
yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know
yeah
even dog licenses i mean
yeah
yeah
going to effect too many
yeah yeah
so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can
but you know every week it gets harder because i could go out and be making money
you know so that's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family
oh i see
uh-huh
yeah yeah well it
[laughter]
yeah you have an inside track or something
yeah yeah
let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson
[laughter]
yeah because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home
you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work
so that's kind of a difference for us i think there's more pressure to um
not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family
so he's
yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up
so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and
yeah that's true mister mom and
uh-huh
yeah yeah
that's true
yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um
kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and
you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now
you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know
yeah yeah
yeah
but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah
yeah it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because wh- when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all
first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know
i mean i don't even know anybody that you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know
oh boy
yeah
yeah
[noise]
oh
[noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah and that they
they think the whole world is like that
we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international co- you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they're graduate students from all over the world
and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different
cultures and different backgrounds we got invited to one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm [laughter] if he was from Iran or some place i don't know where but um you know
yeah yeah
oh uh-huh
oh
yeah yeah
oh gosh
yeah yeah
yeah really [laughter]
that is part of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now
kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean
people ha- you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys
oh yeah it's just
[vocalized-noise]
oh gosh
yeah me too in Chicago we didn't i didn't even date a guy that had a car until i was in college [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
gosh my kids are going to be hating me [laughter] i guess i'll give them a bike and say here's it till you can afford to pay the insurance you know
[laughter]
yeah no kidding
yeah
well
did we cover it everything [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
okay [laughter] i guess i'll get back to my laundry
[laughter]
you too good luck bye-bye
[noise]
well which ones are yours
yeah i don't watch LA Law much that's usually when i'm fighting to put my kids to bed
uh i like to watch the shows that come on from seven to nine on ABC you know everyday of the week just about
oh uh like on Monday nights that's on CBS is Major Dad and uh [noise]
uh it's about a guy that's in the Marine Corp
ye- oh well it's a cute show you know yeah and Who's The Boss that's my favorite there i just like Tony Danza for some reason and uh
yeah well [vocalized-noise] you know
oh i don't watch that one i've never watched it i ju-
yeah i- well i know it's on Fox thirty three and
i don't know i- i just the sight of Al Bundy and the woman just kind of turn my stomach
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
now uh
it's like a nighttime soap isn't it
n- well i i really don't know about it i think Harry Hamlin's on it
ye- i'm not sure i just uh for some reason or another that name's sticking out uh i do know they see most of the shows i watch they got cute guys on them
[laughter]
you know uh
uh let's see i'm trying to think of his name uh i like i say i've never watched it i you know i see the previews and that's it
oh yeah my son loves that
well that ones the the ho- home videos is with uh
what's his name
i know he [vocalized-noise]
ye- well he plays Danny Tanner on uh
on Full House now we watch that every Friday night
yeah my son loves Michelle you know he's about her age he's four so so he likes Michelle
and uh
he he likes The Simpson's too but we don't watch them you know we just got cable a while back and we didn't you know we didn't get any channels except for uh twelve and eight
what's that
w- i don't either i don't you know uh
um uh i don't think it's for kids he's he he only watches it when we uh are flipping through channels and we happen to come across it and the only reason he likes it is cartoons

you too nice talking to you bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
[laughter] really [noise] i like it
i- i like um
[vocalized-noise] um um working with flowers and stuff like that
oh just mowing the mowing the yard
[laughter]
that's probably why you hate it so much
uh-huh
i kind of enjoy working out in the yard i- i enjoy working out in the yard i mean in the summertime it's hard here because it gets so hot
you have to like get up at six o'clock in the morning if you're going to mow the yard and not faint while your doing it
yeah
[noise] no no i'm married
well we both do sometimes
well we're we're moving to a new house and so we'll we'll have to get started over there [noise]
decide what we're going to plant and everything at the at the old house we had a lot of roses
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
it does get really hot here
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
we tried that last year and but we hadn't lived here in Dallas for you know long enough to
to remember that you have to do like um i have this sister who lives in Florida and she plants her garden in January harvest in May
plant again in um late September
and then harvest like in December
yeah that's right because the summertime you just can't grow anything and we tried to plant in like end of March or April and everything just toasted i mean it just [noise]
oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what
probably late January
right when it just as soon as it stops freezing
[noise]
because you know i mean last summer
the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day long every day and because it would just it would just burn to a crisp
oh yeah [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
why did he make you do it
[noise] [laughter] well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard [laughter] and you can do what you want to do [laughter]
[laughter]
no but he will be
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
well i- i didn't seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them
no
oh well like i said we tried last year but we didn't do it right
[laughter]
and it's going to be too late this year by the time we get moved so we'll probably wait and maybe in the fall we might plant a fall garden this year
but we're not going to try to do anything during the summertime because it is just too hot
um-hum
yeah
yeah that's what i said you know summ- during the summertime you've got to get up at six o'clock in the morning
to do it before you know before it gets hot and one time last year i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then
oh it was just awful
[laughter] and so humid
oh no because were fixing to move
really [laughter]
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] nice talking to you too
thanks oh thanks
[noise]
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay i don't know about you but i hate to do yard work and i pay somebody to do all of my yard work
yeah
do you
oh well i- i
[vocalized-noise] i don't mind doing like gardening or just stuff like that but i'm just regular cutting the grass and
i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i can't wait until i'm old enough so i don't have to do this anymore
because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i'm going to have some landscaping put in
so i don't know i don't i i'm single a- a- a- and so i don't know i don't
if i had a a man around to do it it might be different i don't know
pardon me
do you
um-hum
[laughter]
do you cut the grass and stuff
you do you live by yourself
but you still do it anyway
you both do it that's nice
do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff
oh [vocalized-noise]
um those are pretty
i- i used to have a house that had a really it was really well landscaped and i- i enjoyed the flowers and the and the trees the things this
house doesn't have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didn't put in anything in the way of shrubs or flowers but i think i am going to have that done
have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just
i'm not i don't tolerate the heat well
i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it
although i have i did try one year um out here in Dallas but i lived i used to live in San Antonio and i did try grow- having a garden where i grew tomatoes and vegeta- different vegetables and that was kind of fun
to get out and work and that
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
ooh
isn't that when when are you [vocalized-noise] i thought that was when you were supposed to plant
when when are you supposed to plant it
wh- when are you supposed to plant then
really
um
[noise] i didn't realize that
yeah yeah
it does eat up the wat- eats up your water bill i know that [laughter]
but um [noise]
i don't know i've i
[vocalized-noise]
i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know i'd rather spend my time doing other things
and i know my dad always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard
uh he made us do the grunt work
my sister and me yeah he like he
that's what he yeah i- i can't tell you how many times i heard that
and my son o- my son only five so he's not old enough yet to send out to to the do the yard work [laughter]
about five more years maybe but um i don't know i don't know really
it's interesting i don't i don't know part of the reason i think is that i don't know anything about it when i had my other house and it was already landscaped and i
you know i didn't know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um
i heard ros- i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of
you did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that
well that's good have you have you ever grown any vegetables
um to- tomatoes
[laughter]
yeah [noise] um
hum
it's an interesting
i think it's an interesting you know it's an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and
you know but like i said i don't tolerate the heat and the
some of it's fun but the cutting of grass and i just don't enjoy that [laughter]
oh i s-
at six o'clock yeah yeah i know
have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet cutting it and stuff
i just had mine done for the first time last week yeah
so it's getting to be i- i usually have it done about every other week
and i don't know now it's not growing real fast [vocalized-noise] it will pick up
it's just getting green um i prefer to see green than brown [laughter]
but
well it was nice talking to you
and good luck on your moving and your garden [laughter] thanks
[laughter] bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
hi Mary have you gone visiting uh any [vocalized-noise] new restaurants lately
uh-huh i i tend to get stuck in in and i find a place that i like and i stay there um i [laughter] some of the things i like are atmosphere um
food price um but mostly i think you know service and atmosphere are the two things that you know i don't minds paying little bit if if i don't have to wait too long to eat and if the service is good the food is good
and i find like th- the places that i'm going to now um
bec- whenever you find a place that's good [vocalized-noise] other people have already already found the same kind of a place and so sometimes i have to go to this place in uh where i know i have to wait at least fifteen minutes sometimes a half hour
and um they have little bar there so we sit there and um s- sipping on some mixed drinks before we get to eat
uh-huh
wow okay So this
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh [vocalized-noise] they must have some good food there
uh-huh
uh i had uh an opportunity to visit visit the Dallas area and uh i went to a some steak houses while i was out there and there was this one place that i visited that was really unique the waitresses were dressed with like little cowgirls
[noise] and the i don't remember the name of the place but for a menu all they had was a it was like a wooden block
and and um i think for food they had steak and beans [laughter] and they had three different sizes of steak The cowboy the cowgirl and the
i forget the the other one the he-man or something like this and um i i i found it uh to be very good The atmosphere was good it was a lot of fun
uh-huh
huh
oh no kidding
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh that's too bad see how one one place one person can make a big difference on whether you go back to the place again
uh-huh
wow okay
yeah oh that's re- that's really too bad i had um one place that i enjoyed going to but my my girlfriend didn't like it and then i had asked her about it and she said um
that the reason why she didn't like it was that she felt that the place wasn't cleaned well um they had um younger kids you know wiping the tables down and they weren't very
well trained i guess and they didn't do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the waitresses came they she just put all of the clean utensils and everything right on top of these dirty tables [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah right
[laughter] i- i can certainly understand that in fact in this same restaurant that my girlfriend doesn't like to go to she um frequently finds food
struck onto the utensils as where she's got to go through uh three or four uh different um utensils and the the the waitresses are very nice they'll they'll keep exchanging it
but [vocalized-noise] they don't look you know like uh [vocalized-noise] she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and
yeah
that's true
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
yeah yeah i agree the management should know about it but the waitress should especially if you ask them to take something back to look at the ones that she's uh bringing over to you instead of just grabbing a handful and bring them over again [laughter]
oh boy
[laughter]
[noise] how about fast food do you enjoy um fast food restaurants
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah yeah i enjoy it once in a while but i enjoy relaxing while i eat you can't really do that in these fast food places
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh at a
at a restaurant or at home
at home oh yeah
we're just beginning with that it um it took one of the pizza companies and i think it was um gee Domino's
yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing
uh-huh
we have
no which one is that
huh
yeah we have uh Popa- did you ever here of Popaginos
okay we have a that's a fairly large chain in New England we have a a Popaginos um and they had not been delivering up until the time where uh Domino's began delivering and within a matter of six months they started up there own delivery service
uh-huh
it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is is a get little survey uh you know like we're doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management
and then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
oh that's too bad it [noise]
[noise]
um
[noise]
hi
well i haven't been to any new ones but i have uh several that i frequent uh mainly because of specialties in foods
and i have so many [vocalized-noise] so many
foods that i prefer uh that i enjoy such as oriental foods i don't like Japanese food but i like all Chinese foods
ah sounds familiar [laughter]
yes
yes
[laughter]
oh that sounds uh very much like one of our very very best places to get steaks
uh and they open at five and if your not there at five thirty you'll probably have about an hour wait
and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be but it's it's an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks
strictly cash and they've been in business oh for at least forty years uh that's they
yes yes it it's their their steaks are exquisite they also have uh excellent uh liver which i happen to like
and um those are the two specialties which they have uh that and their stewed tomatoes which are well known all over the Dayton area
oh
uh-huh uh-huh
right
[laughter]
[laughter]
yes right well one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here not uh too very long ago uh called Harbor Lights specializes in fish
and uh the atmosphere is fantastic and i was there with it's a group um
that uh we were having a going away dinner for a friend and there were twelve of us and i the the food that uh we ordered uh each of us was quite good but the service was horrendous
and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didn't
refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out
and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person
yes and
oh absolutely [vocalized-noise] what made me angry was that when there are groups such as ours there were twelve of us they automatically put the tip on the bill
and i'll tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor service
but
[noise]
oh
yes right right
oh well it [vocalized-noise] one thing that gets me is when you see them do uh putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth
and that really up sets me when i see that [laughter]
oh
ah
uh-huh
yes but yeah
oh
no no and actually you know those are the kind of things that should get taken back to the management
um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and uh cleaned in the kitchen and if they're not cleaned off well when they go through the dishwasher food just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them
um if they air dry them or heat dry them it dries it right on and that's terrible
yes
[laughter] i agree with that but just don't ever get a glass that has lipstick on it oh that is terrible i had that happen only once i don't remember where but it's always
one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i get
yeah i don't mind that um my husband never cared for fast food so we didn't go that often but you know i have no problem with uh going to a McDonald's or a Wendy's or uh
or a a Long John Silver's or any of those once in a while not often but once in a while
yeah
oh yeah
that's that's very true now once in a while if there's a good ballgame like there's going to be tonight [laughter] with Duke and uh um Kansas City
uh uh Kansas uh cause see now i would enjoy having a pizza
and just sit and watch the game and a have a pizza and a beer that i would enjoy
no no at home just have it delivered yeah we we have number of our pizza places deliver and i assume that you have that there also
Domino's was the first one to start yes
yes yes
uh we have Domino's we have Pizza Hut and then we have a couple of other smallers
Little Ceasars and Juan's Pizza they're all in the general vicinity where i live and so i can and then yet my most favorite one doesn't deliver
uh it's called Marian's Pizza but i think it is local
and the
no
um-hum
right yeah that makes a big difference well we have a lot of businesses going out of business
uh in this area and i don't know whether it's necessarily uh nationwide
but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh rest- smaller restaurants i can't compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under
yes yes absolutely
well i um uh i've been retired from education uh for oh what eight years and i do i have a bunch of had i should say a bunch of little jobs such as a a sales associate um [vocalized-noise] of women's
specialty dress shop and um i was a a manager part-time at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a modeling agency and modeling so
the card shop just went out of business we've been there almost a year almost two years but uh and the car- the store was precious everyone liked the store they liked the kinds of cards and what have you but the location was so poor
and it was in a uh shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that took them almost four years to really get that going and that strip filled up
but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip
and there's still no stores on either side and it's been over a year and a half yes and and it's sad because it was a it was a nice store and she was such a lovely young gal to work for i just feel very bad
hi this is Norma Smith
pardon
hi Jerry
uh
i'm in Blacksburg Virginia
right down uh southwestern part of the state in the mountains [laughter]
oh no no they've uh got volunteers apparently any all over the country
uh-huh

i see [noise]
uh-huh
well
TV shows
uh yeah i guess i am
[laughter]
okay fine
Jerry
uh-huh
we watch a lot of that al- we watch uh CNN a lot
and then i think one of my favorite shows is LA Law
uh-huh
uh we have cable here
i see
right yeah
well that's right and we never have signed up for those i just haven't been interested in what they generally have on and
would be just as happy not to have them in the house [laughter]
no nope we uh our family's grown in fact we've just been retired for about a year we took early retirement and
just really enjoying ourselves
is that right
well
uh my husbands fifty five and i'm a couple of years old- well he's fifty seven i'm a couple years older than that time goes by
but he was with IBM fa thirty years
and decided he'd had enough of it [laughter]
[laughter]
do you still have children do you have children at home
right
well our daughter in Texas is working for TI uh on a part time basis so that's how we found out about this calling
um-hum well we watched the ACC play-offs or i guess
rooting for Duke Un- rooting for Duke University [laughter]
yeah that's on
right it's on again tonight
um-hum
uh
it's uh
it's seven o'clock here right
right we've just been watching the national news
i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch Johnny Carson and wa- the eleven o'clock news but it makes it so late
uh-huh i think we do to
i hate it too i just would rather stay the way it is [laughter]
i li- i like the i like some of the dramas
shows
and i like mysteries
but
uh-huh we like uh
we get the uh
Financial News Network
and we like to watch that check up on what's happening with all the stocks and
[laughter]
uh-huh
no i don't care for tho-
too much
[laughter] the only crazy comedy i [noise] really like is Saturday Night Live [laughter]
do you ever watch that
[noise]
[noise]
uh-huh we don't watch that much
right uh-huh
uh
no i don't either i just don't have any interest
yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to soap operas
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh
no i think it'd be an awful waste of time
well enjoyed it too Jerry and
uh
[noise] today it was pretty chilly and windy
the sun was out bright but it was kind of cold
i guess it was probably in the fifties but there's a strong wind
very nice we had company [vocalized-noise] very nice
oh [laughter]
uh-huh you had company
oh i see
uh-huh yeah that makes it hard
well you too good TV viewing [laughter]
bye
[noise]
hi
i'm Jerry Crow from Dallas
i'm Jerry Crow from Dallas
where where you from
in Virginia golly
oh i had first had thought this was just Texas Instruments but apparently it's not just Texas Instruments
yeah i've talked to some people from Attleboro
uh Massachusetts
uh several of those people
uh-huh yeah i work in Lewisville which is just outside of Dallas
well our topic is uh TV shows you ready to get started
yeah what we like about them our favorites and so forth
okay i'll go ahead and punch one
[noise]
okay i guess my favorites are probably the the uh news format programs like Hard Copy Sixty Minutes Twenty Twenty uh Current Affair things like that
yeah
yeah
we don't have cable unfortunately so we just get but we've got plenty of local stations to look at
but uh
yeah
about the only reason i would want cable probably is is for some of the uh sports programs
that they don't show local
like HSEN ESPN
but the mu- movie sh- uh cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over
um
and they're usually
yeah
but uh do you have small kids
okay
oh
i wished i could do that i've been TI thirty two years
yeah but i'm only fifty seven
so i've still got a few years to go
yeah yeah
yeah
well i've had enough of it but unfortunately they don't pay enough
for early retirement
no huh-uh no all my kids are grown married
uh-huh
yeah
but uh
every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night
yeah oh yeah uh i- in fact it's on tonight
yeah yeah it ought to be a good uh good game tonight
it it doesn't start until seven o'clock our time so we still got another hour
are you all behi- what time is it there it's six o'clock here now
seven o'clock so you all are behind us
yeah
but uh
yeah makes it so late well we're fixing to go on daylight saving time uh next this next weekend
so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning
[laughter]
yeah
well i guess like i said my favorite show what's your favorite shows or you like the news formats
yeah
yeah i like uh the true life adventures too
yeah
yeah
i i don't uh watch too much of the of the uh network shows i all i like to watch uh
let's see some of the the uh prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while i'll watch Star Search
uh
but uh
not too many of the situation comedies do i care for
and i'm definitely not a soap fan
yeah or uh i
yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video
and uh Su- uh what is it uh
uh
Bloopers and Su- Practical Jokes
but um
i don't know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but
i guess plenty of people do
yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it
but uh
that that's not real life to me so
yeah
well i enjoyed talking with you and
and how how's you all's weather up there you cold
yeah
yeah
well you
yeah did you have a good Easter
yeah we did too
i told my wife i sure do wish they'd gave us Monday off rather than Friday off
because Sunday was really busy
yeah company and then we went and visited the daughter and and uh didn't get i don't guess we got to bed till about eleven thirty
and then having to get up and go to work the next morning
well you have a good day
oh okay bye-bye
[noise]
well a large organization offers uh
usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and
medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need
and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you
it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case
so uh
um-hum
right that would be uh a
problem of course in my job i don't know who would do it while i'm gone that long we're desperately trying to find time to uh train someone else to do it but i feel certainly it would still be there if if not burying me but uh it'll be there when i get back
uh flex times another benefit that i- i like that TI's been doing uh though officially they just started it uh
uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our
supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and
he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and
and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and
and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so
uh it wasn't too much of a blow but uh the people that we were interfacing with didn't like that too well
they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh
it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit
what have you found that you like in a big organization
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
right
do you
right
um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay
there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just
tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and
and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays
excuse me
no we don't have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah
right too
take it when you want to yeah
right
right
um-hum
right
oh boy
[laughter]
yeah
yeah it is
we've got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works
uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and
he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and
she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a
a Thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so
it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves
so yeah it's nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldn't uh wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left TI to go to a little company and
and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and
it just wasn't as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will you know
and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but
still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh
if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract
and
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
well that's good
yeah it's good that you can
pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base [laughter]
you're getting two things at once there
well have
um-hum
right
right
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i've i've looked at several uh
courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job
uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like
uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in Washington DC and there's one in Oregon
and they're they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um
well we have we have lots of
right
um-hum
we have lots of uh schools they just only only one in the entire area offers a course in what's called
that's true
and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months
[laughter]
w- when you get sequestered and you're there for months
true
yeah
[laughter]
yeah right
well as as you say the the um
benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that
it is a boo- a a a plus to have that ev- as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it
because it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good in- uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's
uh the profit sharing the stock options
there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is
and um
i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job
uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job
and the um
MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people
and they're uh meetings
to keep you full informed
you don't find that much in small companies because you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on
that type of thing um
uh
we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal
it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard
and know and if you have ideas that type of thing
oh i use it up [laughter]
do you have a mandatory
uh do you have a mandatory shut down
oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice
that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to
but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know
and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying
but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments
and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area
so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time
so that isn't too nice
uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time
to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people
so that's quite a feat in itself
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh that's great
yeah really that's excellent
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do
uh where you have to go to school to or run the new au- automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff
and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh
diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things
and interface with the technicians in the toolroom
so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes
and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback
you know and and do the job well
and you're still learning even after all that time because they're very complex machines
exactly that's right
yeah
and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school
that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them
you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years
or uh you know to that affect
and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract
whereas at TI they don't do that
oh
oh
oh
yeah
well this part of the country there's no sh- shortage of uh good schools
you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here
so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school
and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and
i i ass- i assume you have kids
oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet
ah
well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year
yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it
and they uh
in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me
yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong [laughter]
[laughter]
[noise]
um
um yeah
hum hum
[noise]
well i i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can
if you have to you can get mean with them
those little kids don't understand it
um-hum
yeah
well that's a nice way of putting it [laughter]
[laughter]
exact- exactly
and two most people don't have that option
you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do
uh accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public
i don't know back when i was going to school [noise] uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now
i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and
usually bending over to get five of the best
um but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something y- you know without getting sued
oh yeah
well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class
and uh
this kid comes to school with his lunch box
and inside this lunch box he's got
easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills
and i asked him uh what are you doing with that
he says my father gave it to me
and i didn't believe it for a minute
um
so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants
well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing
he was a uh
well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something
but not a lot i could do about it
um-hum
yeah because uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them
uh i don't know guns and
[noise]
i don't know that's something
um-hum
oh yeah
yeah
oh sure i mean i- i- it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong
and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs
and you know here we are we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator
um
i don't know
um-hum
yeah
no
[noise]
yeah that's that's a great deal what law school's like [laughter]
yeah
um yeah [laughter]
and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester
and it's how well you can remember it all
yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying
um
i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize
and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned
so uh it didn't show me anything a year and a half i gave it up
i wasn't really want i didn't want to be a lawyer anyway [noise] just wanted the degree
so
well i don't know what can we do about it
[laughter]
money money is not the answer
yeah i mean th- they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it
from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better
than what we have now
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school
you know i mean i- it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline
yeah exactly i mean i
i- i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something
to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something
oh yeah
[noise]
well lawyers help create that [laughter]
[noise]
well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers
you know somebody okay we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents
you know they just
oh sure i m- mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get any- anything at home then it's it's not going to help either
so i i don't know i don't know what the i don't know what the answer is
it's an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
hum
[noise]
that's interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when [noise] some people first tried that and they got sued
got taken to court by the school system
i'm glad the parents won i mean that's
seems silly that uh i mean we started that's the that's the way you got your education in this country
and then uh
uh we have one she's only nine months old
right well my degree is in teaching so
so i
oh really
um-hum
[laughter] did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or
um-hum
[laughter] well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad i taught remedial reading kids
and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that's what i taught and um
you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way
when you have your slow readers but it it wasn't too bad we we got along real well
[laughter]
yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elem- lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and
got up until about the sixth grade and so that's what i got my certification in
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools
um and my reason for that was i don't like
the
uh what's the right word the varied
inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools
[laughter]
you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could
teach your children on an individual basis
yeah
um-hum
right
um-hum
yeah
and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools
um
um-hum [laughter]
right
crazy for him to but
um-hum
yeah
well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools
or trying to teach them something while they were there
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was bett- trying to teach them was better than have them taken out
yeah
right uh most the time if they were they were some of them were even better behaved i've only had two instances where i cou- it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were
um i don't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but
it ended up better
but
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to um
to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics
and uh and i'm not
completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there d- does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such
but
right
um-hum
well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i've seen how their school system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything
and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be
so i don't completely agree with that either
but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere
oh is it [laughter]
is that what you ended up going into
oh
um-hum
how how much you can stuff in your brain
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well
goo- good question [laughter]
probably taking
no there's plenty of money in the system it's just
i think it's uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States we've got so much built up in um
in the s- in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done
not without [noise] wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so
maybe on smaller smaller scales
um-hum
yeah
um-hum right into the classroom it needs to be
be able to be enforced
um-hum
it's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything
[laughter] that's that's true i've well at least i've heard that i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but
but
um-hum
right
um-hum
oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home
yeah
right
um-hum
yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow
a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be
they're kind of monitored
you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples [noise] but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don't think they're is in in this area but
um they they are monitored by the uh
by the
state school board
so
um-hum
um-hum
i- i like our benefits
i'm pretty satisfied with them uh
the only thing that i think i would change is the network the hospital networking i have Aetna Insurance
you know the company insurance an- and
i woul- i just think i shou- would like to go to my own hospital where my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list that's the only thing i have against it
what is that what is it because of because of expense is that
yeah do you do you use Aetna
yeah you know it's pretty good they're really fast on paying
uh all my claims you know i don't use it that much to be real honest with you i'm alone and and you know it's hard for me i don't go to the doctor unless i'm really sick and i don't get sick that much so you know sometimes i don't even come up with the deductible
in a year
[laughter] you
oh no are you [laughter] did you break something
[noise]
oh my God
oh did you are you on L O A
you didn't
[laughter] [noise]
um oh my gosh well some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing accident somebody up here he's head of oh welf- not welfare but
probations or something on i can't think of what he's the head of uh [vocalized-noise] he skied into a tree
and killed himself forty one years old
so
okay
uh-huh uh
huh
yeah
have more vacation [laughter]
huh i hadn't heard of that
yeah yeah well uh i think TI has good [vocalized-noise] benefits [vocalized-noise]
think we have
oh yeah well
yeah
but no profits right no- i think w- when we when we start showing profit which i hope we do pretty soon [laughter] um that you know because at one time they had good profit sharing from what i understand i- i didn't get in on it unfortunately
but
see i've only been here four
so i'm just trying to hang on to my job [laughter] yeah right yeah all these cutbacks and stuff this is pretty scary
but but i really like working for their TI i think
uh i hate to tell you i'm in payroll
[laughter] but uh i
i love it you don't like it
[laughter]
huh
oh we get gripes but all in all it it works pretty good for everybody you know
and it and i'm sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they'll work them out it it's been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and
it's uh
but it's showing it's rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now
yes boy in the beginning what division are you in
oh fourteen well okay division one was worse [laughter] because that's the biggest division and boy when we put them on oh my God the phone you'd hang up and it would ring [laughter] it was just bad
yeah yeah but it's it's doing pretty well now i think everybody's
see i don't have to go in and approve time okay so i i really
don't know what y'all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with peo- with everybody
and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it's really been a a a godsend it's been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it's been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it's been really good
[laughter] that's a TI benefit new [laughter]
now i don't know who planned it all or ho- i don't even know how they came about
uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know they're were programmers involved and i know the manager and
the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system
[laughter] that was fun
that was fun and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure [laughter] thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was
was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think
so but that's just from my point of view like i said i don't have to sit down and de- depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody [noise]
yeah
yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody
[noise]
yeah
they're several things that have uh changed already on it and now you're going to ask me what and i can't tell you offhand i just know we've had several changes it just [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah well
that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and it's easy and it's so easy that people go
was that all i have to do it you know [laughter] there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before
for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and it's a work group so you know i think uh it's [vocalized-noise] really a lot simpler than the old one
hum-um
uh-huh
[noise]
okay
um-hum
um-hum
well [noise] i
i can see both sides of that issue and i think that uh it's just a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to
the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh
everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it
yes i do
[laughter]
we've used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh
i don't use it that much either uh of course i'm using it right now i had a little skiing accident here in this last month and [laughter] so i'm taking advantage of it right now
yeah i cracked a collarbone separated the shoulder a little bit
nothing too major
[laughter]
no no i didn't even miss work just sl- stick it in a sling and go on
[laughter]
huh-uh
um
i tell you getting back to the benefits
i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh
he's been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think that's a interesting concept
ever heard of that
[noise] be kind of like
smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth
in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area
or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or
or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and
yeah whatever i mean it's uh you know across the board
it's a
yeah it's something they talked about for several years now i don't know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard [laughter]
in picking out what they want and
leave themselves
too short in other areas i guess
well in most cases i'd have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh [laughter]
a little lacking right now
and for the past few years
but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
well i've had a few
good years but not too many
in the fifteen i've been here
um
[laughter]
oh yeah
yeah
yeah it's a good company i don't know what division your in but we uh
[laughter]
oh really
[laughter]
i got a i got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program
well i think it's a great concept but i think you've uh you've left too many uh
uh i'm a supervisor and i appro- i approve the uh the thing it it just doesn't make logical sense you know in other words
it always keep jumping back up to the person
you know where you enter your own n- ID number
the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're going to do the next action on the change you know
and there's a lot of little things like that in there
but [noise]
it it could probably be corrected easily i don't know if anybody's griped about it or not
yeah i think the concept's great you know
um-hum
i'll bet yeah
yeah
fourteen
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
but they've kept you hopping there
oh yeah i think it's uh
definitely got good definitely got a right idea
um-hum
um-hum
yeah yeah
um-hum
yeah
well
that's that's one of the benefits that i uh
you know question
[laughter]
well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by
a few little more
[noise]
i don't know what you'd say attention to the to the right detail and stuff
[laughter]
hum
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh too bad
[laughter]
yeah
well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just
especially if it's standard week they can just don't even have to get in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their employee number and away it goes
yeah working with it it's uh you can see some areas that could be improved
i think they must have worked on it because i've noticed one correction come through already it looks like
man
[laughter]
that's all right
no i'm not the
i only worry with it one time a week when i'm well twice really
[laughter]
when i'm approving and then it's uh
[noise] i've had a chance to
i had a chance to terminate and uh L O A and back to L O A
um-hum
um-hum
yeah right
[laughter]
just
um-hum
yeah
speaking of uh let's see big corporate benefits i wonder if uh
i wonder if they loo- uh have you ever heard of this administaff type thing this staff leasing that a lot of companies do
they uh
that's kind of uh
new thing that come along and uh
benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess it's basically for smaller companies that don't want to have all the
payroll hassle and everything
you fire all your people and they uh they hire them then they lease them back to you and they do all the paperwork and provide the benefit
of course they have
hi
you didn't try we rewallpapering you just uh
did you use a textured paint or
um
well did you get good results
yeah
but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it
well we did a uh
we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down
and then you can just paint right over the dark
well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling
and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or or did something to it and
but because of the th- dark behind it was really really hard to cover
and
yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was
you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought
uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and
uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something
have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted
yeah
yeah
oh that's quite reasonable
[vocalized-noise]
um
the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately
my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took [laughter] this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy of took a piece of brick
and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed uh and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint
and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right ba- she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint
uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic
yeah you know they it but it's electronic
uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the
and it it's really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim
and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample
um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it's it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the
you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match
um
so
gosh
so you so what's your what's the solution then
oh my
well at least you'll get very good at it right
you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside
and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't uh the mold everything is white in a new house everything is white
oh good luck [laughter] we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um
makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls that you know up a couple of feet
and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue
and uh
[vocalized-noise] it makes the room look remarkably smaller
the trim is still white
the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh
uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well
maybe maybe somebody that understands colors would know all of that stuff but
uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows
and uh well of course at night but with the
we have we have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house
and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of
we didn't know that when we bought the house but
yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so
anyway it didn't it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're
we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully
that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend
it's kind of frustrating
well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you
okay good-bye
[noise]
hi
uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom
and i had wallpaper up
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry
and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day
no i i just painted
uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss
and
well no not really i need to it it looks so bad our you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something
yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn't excuse me it didn't uh
uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to
uh-huh
uh-huh
was it like a primer
would you put a huh uh-huh
yeah
oh my goodness that's an awful lot
not inside [noise] now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA
that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim
around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars
yeah yeah
so that wasn't too bad
no i haven't
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh so they did do a good job
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh
a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match
you know
the very same type of paint and everything
so
oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's right
white yeah that's what we're trying to get ours to look like
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh i see
huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what co-
okay white
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
so that uh you get some the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light
all time oh
I see
uh-huh
and it takes a long time [laughter]
yeah really no kidding
it is a lot of work a lot of work
nice talking to you thanks a lot bye
[noise]
when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years or uh
okay
we we're very similarly aged so we probably have an in- an interesting perspective on the music on the times so i'm just a couple years older than you uh
essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me
uh
my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college and i became attached to that style of uh
urban urban country if there is such a thing i think with
uh in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it
uh
over time i became very interested in in baroque classical and i think that was just through
experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat
uh Simon
it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred
music i'm not a not a music um [vocalized-noise] i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music
and i
i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh
people from the late seventies really um Neil Diamond for instance
Um
people of of that particular time i
listen to some country and western but i'm not sch-
schooled in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i've i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it
but when i do play
uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player
right
right
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation
uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but uh not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations
uh
and i found that i really like China Beach and i particularly like Tour of Duty and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows
uh and and i've uh Thirty Something i'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that i find myself listening to
that could well be i i uh
spent my junior year uh
and sophomore and junior year in in college when i a song by the uh
uh i think the title of it was just Downtown
uh and if you recall how it goes downtown da dah dah dah
uh all i have to do is hear that song
and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work
uh and
my family now knows if they come into my study and uh
i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school
uh
and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away
[laughter]
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it that's right
uh probably about first grade
and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to to do something about it
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably i am swept away by the
the pressure of other types of things uh
it is in order to continue to to grow and i
i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate [laughter] music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what it is that other people take for granted
in composition themes and i [vocalized-noise] keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved
uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but it doesn't for me
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh [vocalized-noise]
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance uh
that's the most fascinating thing [laughter]
and you sir you take care
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
i don't know i grew up uh in the the sixties and at that time
uh it was uh a changing time for the whole music scene i guess and i grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and
kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter but have since
uh since i grew up in a small town in in southern Oklahoma i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music um
i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a an opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pop
uh sounding music it didn't have what you know i guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years
yeah that was my teenage years i was born in fifty and and uh
yeah
yeah
that's kind of the way i am
it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone
and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into i'm kind of the say way i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music
from from pop to classical i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio stations as a DJ for all my college years trying to support my way through there and supp- was support was uh
influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in
probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music
uh that they were using behind them because they used especially Disney used a lot of classical music
behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there and i think that uh got deep seated into me one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is
uh are those that call on those classical uh
roots i guess uh Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about but he does have some things Chicago had some things
uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some
some real um
influences by classical music and
i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music
yeah
yeah
i'm kind of thinking that that's maybe our generation was
uh so in tuned to music
of that time that we identify
goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them
uh-huh
right
yeah that's their signal
yeah
did when did you first take your uh your first piano lesson
yeah
yeah
it is a time consumer
yeah
right
no it's making that uh that connection especially with the mechanical
parts of it i was never able to to master all that in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh
parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing
and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again they sold the piano and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so i that's one of things i felt like i missed in life and i i really in fact uh
one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin that is played on uh piano i just
you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that
maybe one of these days i'll you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it i'll do something with the piano but probably not
just never got a chance to come out no
well it's a pleasure talking with you
best of luck in your graduate school
good-bye
[noise]
um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won't go to a fast food place [laughter]
i really can't stand those uh
um
quality of the food [laughter]
yeah
yeah
you had a good time there
yeah
uh-huh
okay
um
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true
there's some places though that i go to because i like the food there and i kind of they don't have the best service or they're not the friendliest but i'll i'll tolerate it just because i know that's the kind of food i want to eat
and there's other places but like you said the the food doesn't matter it's you have such a good time there
yeah i have not in not in a good while but
just to see the show just to see the show right
uh-huh
um
um
yeah that sounds pretty wild
yeah
predictable yeah
yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea
well there's this uh there's this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those
where they they brew their own beer there
yeah and there's i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and there's actually there's two in the Raleigh area
[noise] and uh i'm a i'm a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there [noise] and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler
and and while you're eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test it's like uh beer tasting thing while you're eating your meal and it's really neat
um
yeah i usually don't [laughter] go somewhere that's too far away
but uh
yeah
yeah well i guess for like lunch places that's really important because you usually that much time or or whatever
oh so that's why we're getting all these Dallas people that's what i figured but
i didn't i don't want to assume that that's what i figured no i'm a col- i'm a university student so uh
that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when you're flat broke all the time
but uh i'm going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change
yeah
um-hum
no well actually i graduated
with a BS in double E in in eighty eight [noise] and i've been in school ever since then
i took one semester off and and i've been taking a cla- at least one class every semester
uh-huh
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah
um
i've become a lot more health conscious and that's why i stopped eating fast food and places like that
i used to love hamburger joints and i don't go to them i don't eat hamburgers anymore but
[laughter]
i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places
[noise]
Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger
yeah
now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever [noise]
not quite that bad but uh
[laughter]
yeah good talking to you we'll see you later bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to
uh-huh
yeah
um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back
is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me
the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important to me
uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses
yeah exactly uh that's real important to me i i can't stand going to a stuffy place i mean it's just that's not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants aren't any good either
but uh you know i don't necess- uh you know there's a place here uh it's um it's goo- it's a barbecue place and it's uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff
but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and and joking with you all the time and i you know that's one reason why i like to go back
you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important
but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there
uh-huh
have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that
well see i'm uh i've been to dinner theaters but th- every time i go it's you know on the nonmeal show ty- you know type thing so i've it's been a while since i've been to one uh
yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although there's one that i'm i'm really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks it's a i just found out that well i'm sure they've they've had them for a along time but it's uh
it's like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're they're doing this act and they they get supposedly get the uh the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know
ca- because i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them out before they do you know
of course that's probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh
that aren't you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don't know
yeah
so um [noise] i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though
no hadn't heard of them
oh yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
yeah that sounds kind of neat
uh is location at all important to you
like you know how far it is from your house or whatever
well yeah i i guess
yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest [laughter] you know the clos- as long as it's it's it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food
um no kidding
[laughter]
working for TI that's pretty important [laughter]
yeah yeah
[laughter]
so yeah that
oh okay
oh yeah money does
[laughter] yeah i can see that
so
so you grad- are graduating or
yeah well maybe i don't know i'd uh i really haven't changed that much since i was in sch- in school um of course you know i'm not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh
depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know
[laughter]
yeah well like i said though my my ch- my taste in in food really hadn't changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn't have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before
whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things bef- you know lately and you know it's like i said i missed the dinn- dinner part of it but i've gone to the theater
uh but i you know like i said that's that's probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadn't even really considered that before
um
yeah
yeah well that's probably true to so
uh-huh
[laughter]
well unfortunately i'm not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah well it's like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey you're right health is one thing that just
i was [vocalized-noise] i was wondering yeah [laughter]
well all right well i think that should just about do it
yeah take care uh-huh bye
[noise]
um what kind of house do you live in
oh yeah
with with a yard and fence
i'm in an apartment in uh Plano
yeah they are if uh kind of depends on what you're looking for mine's just a one bedroom place that's uh
uh it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years
and uh just i'm getting back into apartment life
and it's
yeah but
well they vary from from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh
they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place
yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that
yeah
wow that's a lot for a townhouse
but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it
yeah
yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it
yeah
oh yeah i've owned uh several and built several uh
well well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs and
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas
and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north
oh yeah
yeah
yeah it does h- how long have you been in this house
ten years
no you really don't were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than than Dallas area
how were the how were the house prices up there
yeah
wow
hum
oh yeah
well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney
uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here
and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there
so in a way i guess it works both ways you know
yeah
that's a fact [vocalized-noise]
[laughter] i guess that's true and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep because they don't hardly have any
that's true there's not too many basements in Texas
[laughter]
yeah gosh i remember when i was little uh we didn't have a i lived grew up in southern Oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar and w- we never did
and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and i
to this day i don't care if i go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me
yeah
yeah
you ever thought about building a house
you ever thought about building a house
yeah that's true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know
yeah do you work
do you work
so how do you handle do you got any kids
so you got he's working and you're working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those
[laughter]
yeah
you basically can take care of everything yourself
yeah
yeah
what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or
wow you too
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
oh yeah
yeah sounds like you you've already got the makings for being a general contractor
yeah
[laughter]
if you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together
yeah i built three houses in my life and
oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things
ye-
you bet
oh you bet
oh yeah
well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to to take care of it but
hum
um-hum
oh yeah they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made already
oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story h- house and i had room for everything
in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's it's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill a- available space but
uh
yeah you can yeah you know you l- you adjust you figure out
it's not as bad as i thought it was
uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be
uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh
yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that
uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet
yeah yeah [vocalized-noise] you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that
and uh they're trying to to unwind
oh yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that
yeah
oh yeah
oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh
you're always paying for something you know
um-hum
oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong
uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard Texas uh Fox and Jacobs
[noise]
how about you guys
are you in a hou- apartment or a house
well they say that those are easy to fin- or difficult to find
how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time
uh-huh
what's a what's a one bedroom are you in a um well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know
um-hum
ooh that does get high yeah i mean
yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty
so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know
yeah
and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but uh there's no investment in it you know
all it allows you to do is itemize [laughter]
on your
on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's uh have you ever owned your own home
so you know what it's like yeah it's like when you first this is our third one it's not um and it's not that exciting after a while
yeah suburban track yeah
we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah it's really it's really sad because they're they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like Hou- have you ever been to Houston
you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know
we've been in here ten years
yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it
yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
my home town um the prices
actually a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size
and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty
yeah it's really and we didn't think it was that clean but then after you're gone for a while it looks cleaner you know
um
yeah Saint Louis whatever
really
i guess it's yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for JC Penney in marketing
and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it
but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell [laughter]
yeah
yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in public relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know
and i said you haven't heard about tornados [laughter] how about bugs you know [laughter]
uh-huh
yep
that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know
but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean
pardon me
yeah actually when we were up north um but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but um
we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it
[noise]
yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's um pardon me
yes i do
uh no we don't
uh how do i take care of the house well i don't have a Mexi- i don't i shouldn't say that i don't have an ethnic maid [laughter] i don't have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and she's got a uh
a live out nanny um but any rate i don't have any of that um i don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know
we have a
yeah we have a dog and we're pretty i mean we're not fanatically neat but um we keep things up you know it's not like where there's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring
um no we're pretty much um we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together
and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet
he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that
[laughter] yeah no thanks i [vocalized-noise]
have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time [laughter]
and how'd that go
uh-huh
getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older
you start um the dollar value on things
i you know i think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic
i know i'm supposed to talk about homes but people that o- the people that own them are the home homes themselves and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't [laughter]
yeah that's
i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from New York with Exxon or JC Penney and it's just a hoot to watch them
right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house
oh my goodness yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well in a way you can travel light
how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that
uh-huh
[laughter]
yes i do
everybody pretty much kee- keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak
yeah
uh-huh
yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah
and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right
isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid
oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and
i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent
so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize
yeah exactly we
yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up
so you know
how did you first get involved in camping
yeah
uh-huh
are you a native Texan
oh okay
i guess i grew up uh camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern Oklahoma and they were uh we were always hit Texoma or
some camping area all of either Texas or Oklahoma
and i was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid and we were camping uh seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere
i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law
who live in Arlington and go camping uh a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull
that has uh you know two bedrooms a TV and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup
when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it
well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it
i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there
um-hum
i'm not familiar with that one
yeah
oh yeah
boy that's a fact
yeah well [vocalized-noise] a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls
they ha- i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with a uh a natural
uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in
uh dad never believed in tent camping uh we had some old army cots that we would sleep on uh uh come
good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes
a lot of good memories in in in camping you know it helps you unwind and get away and forget [vocalized-noise] TI and everything else back home i guess
no i haven't i've never been up there
yeah
well that that's true i've never though- i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there
yeah
well
well that would be great there pretty co-
shoot let come what may
and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late
they they got a place where you uh can keep your boat while you're there for the weekend
yeah
that
yeah
oh yeah
yeah so it's time to quit
that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it
yeah
oh that's outstanding
oh yeah
i've got a boy that is uh thirteen and the girl is eleven the boy had learned to
uh ski oh probably two years ago he's a slalom skier now and the girl's eleven and she just now starting to uh learn to ski
i've got a sixteen and a half foot Bayliner it's inboard outboard just a ski boat it's about the right size for us
yeah i know them
you bet
goodness
yeah i expect it would
yeah but boy it would move you across the water though
that's what you want plus out on Texoma you have got all that you know mass of water to get across
outstanding
uh-huh
[noise]
you're right
absolutely that's what happened to us we had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there
so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh i'd say eleven years uh since we got back into boating and then now they are big enough to
you bet plus they can help now too they don't [vocalized-noise] go along for the ride
well i guess we've had our uh five minutes uh so we'll ye- call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill
sure
uh
well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been going up into Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh
dammed up the uh White River real pretty in Arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and just stay close to home
oh right yeah
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] well i have heard a lot about Possum Kingdom
oh yeah
it's not over crowded
yeah
well that see that's one of my biggest gripes about Texoma as many times as we would go up there it's it's so rough
that sounds
oh no
well that sounds like a good place to start out this spring i am looking forward to it
all right thanks a lot Bill nice talking to you good bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh i guess uh it's hard tell i guess probably i didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping uh but uh
later on uh later on i think when my oldest daughter got involved she and i got involved in Indian Princesses we used to go up at Possum Kingdom and do a lot of camping at Possum Kingdom
no no i'm i'm New England Massachusetts
oh okay
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah that
[vocalized-noise] that's they yeah kind of cheating isn't it
no hum
yeah
oh sure speaking of uh southern Oklahoma uh you go up into the Arbuckle Mountains at all camping up in there
yeah we went up to uh i talking about being an Indian Princesses i was actually in it seven years with two daughters four with one three with the other and with my second daughter we camped up at Camp Classen one time
and uh well it's right uh
you know i'm trying to think where it is it's not too far over the border and it's up in the middle of the Arbuckles and it's near Turner Falls
and uh uh that is just absolutely when you consider how flat everything is here that absolutely beautiful company to uh country to camp in
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh yeah uh another thing how about uh have you been to the Texans Texoma side
oh for goodness sakes that is that is just really nice we kind of
you know i've been at TI thirty two years and in my young single days i used to camp there a lot then i sort of forgot about it for twenty years and uh
uh two years ago my children started ask- they saw picture of it over at Texans and uh we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it
yeah and uh it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's uh
uh concrete pads that you can put tents on there's places to pull in RVs and plug them in up uh there's even two and what we we used
they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows
so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag
and sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor you got a roof over your head
yeah let come what may
yeah they're very close to the water within like uh a hundred yards
yeah yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat you can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's uh it's in a protected area
so and i i've got a son
really started going about sev- he's seventeen now he was he was fifteen then but uh i've got a son [vocalized-noise] son and both daughters like to go and uh they have got a a a dock uh down in the protected area
where the fishing pretty good and uh
you know we'll leave we'll leave him down there at ten o'clock at night with his fishing pole and sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up
but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to uh clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers
yeah yeah you you've got to be a a a Texas member but if you are a master member of Texans the the membership to Texoma is free
uh you can you can get a family membership do you your family camp at all you you camp with your family how how what what
oh boy
yeah
what kind of a boat do you have
uh-huh
yeah when i was yeah in my young in my young single days i had a uh Turbocraft are you familiar with that
yeah i had a uh a uh sixteen foot hundred and nine horse power six cylinder one and i i had that for two or three years and then i traded it for a eighteen foot uh two hundred and twenty horsepower V eight
and uh oh that thing eat gasoline [laughter] uh we could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing
[vocalized-noise] move you across the water and it would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash
yeah
yeah plus it it it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything because there was was nothing under it but unfortunately what i did was and i i guess what what happened when i was single i had it
and my wife and i skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along when they're real little they can't really participate and i guess i was paying more on insurance and maintenance than i was getting out of it and i sold it
and never had a chance really to get back to boating again
yeah
yeah
yeah you re- rediscover you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it yeah
yeah
yeah right where do you
oh okay okay i just i ca- i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski uh where you ski
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah i'll tell you i i would recommend too Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there
and uh in the Texans area has got two nice launching ramps
one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open uh the other place that i would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom
and that is absolutely the prettiest that
when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at Lavon
ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm
yeah its too open
yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it
yeah oh okay well you ready to wind up hey nice talking to you my friend yeah good night bye-bye
[noise]
[laughter] i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last genera- well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well
take it back thirty years [laughter] i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home
period an- and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married
and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it
until the kids you were little
yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day
and then
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job
and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are
who are totally prepared to tea- to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and
and uh we'll see how the generations go huh
yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh
mechanical engineer with T I
and uh i did it for six years
and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old
and and it just drove me crazy
i could not do either well enou- i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess- or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays
as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country
also with uh with work for like three months and and
yeah
yeah
it might have been better
yeah
yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once
well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer [laughter] i'm i'm i'm a photographer now
i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer
that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years
and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else
to do
yeah and it- it's great while they're really little but as they get older
and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do
and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and y- you know and not really school but
but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society
yeah i think they do too
and i need it for the break [laughter] so
um-hum
and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing
yeah
yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next
ten year- even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time
because if if i if i had been allowed to work
you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week
i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy
and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures
in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids
can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know an- an- when he's at home can take care of them
i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well
it's going to have to be both
yeah
you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom
doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it
in that other you know uh that i should do it or tha- or just to think about doing it rather than having someone [vocalized-noise] tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help
and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no [laughter]
yes and
yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it
they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the [vocalized-noise] on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and
and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be do- this is the time this needs to be done but
that's right
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much
this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were
needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned
and it's gonna
it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't
[vocalized-noise] yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values
and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little
you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older
but if no one does anything when they're little
then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older
[laughter] yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work
but i think
if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did
so well you- you- you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah but but
but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job
yeah
did you
um-hum
oh yeah
so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there
but uh if you're going to be more pro- professional oriented
then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that
that doesn't really go with the family
um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think
oh yeah
oh okay you've found something else
um-hum
yeah
yeah
yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides
the same person every day
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and
and if it's not
if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible
um-hum
yeah
well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know who- whose job is this
well it- it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to
so uh
to m- yeah to yeah to m-
yeah well
um-hum
yeah
and you you you
yeah you talk yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
an- and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that's a very hard attitude to change
um-hum
hm uh
um-hum
yeah
and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas
to so that they know that uh you know [vocalized-noise] male and female are both responsible for doing this and
and uh
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because
mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility
and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases
yeah
um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any
relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you
yeah
um-hum
yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know m- my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well and i miss that
and i want
yeah the men have to be convinced of that
no
[noise]
okay we're supposed to
talk about what the weather's been like let's see uh
yeah it's been windy the past few weeks i've noticed that
has been hasn't been too much rain which is really nice
because last week all that rain and it was just
bad with all the flooding when uh Trinity Mills Road flooded over all those times and you couldn't i couldn't pass by it
well i- i didn't have to go down there but uh
uh driving on the freeway was uh made it difficult because everybody couldn't get off and they'd get off somewhere else
yeah the current average or whatever
yeah finally
i like the warm weather [laughter]
and the winter wasn't that bad i was really grateful that it didn't get that bad this winter
i'm not uh fan of cold weather i've lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much
yeah
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah i don't mind the heat that much it doesn't bother me that much cold weather i just i don't know i just can't tolerate too much with the uh
yeah so i like Texas it's a nice place to be
and so i guess it's probably the same over where you're at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville
i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt
that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country
yeah
yeah
of course
who can't use that [laughter]
yeah
especially in Texas period
well have you lived in Texas all your life
no uh this is this is the fifth state i've lived in
yeah
so i've just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold
i mean one day it was like sixty below zero
and uh uh they said you know stay inside
in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's going to be like eighty below
and he said uh this is serious folks this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason [laughter]
and i thought yeah no kidding
that of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze you know in the country and this last winter wasn't wasn't that bad as as i remember it
uh-huh
is that right
[laughter]
schizophrenic weather
[laughter]
yeah
you realize it [laughter]
yeah
when i lived in California they had uh
what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year-round which what i thought was great you didn't have to worry about tornadoes you didn't have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice
but uh i don't mind the heat
i don't i don't miss the cold at all but i don't mind the heat
yeah that's right it's kind of nice too to have that fall
spring and fall are nice times of the year
spring because we're getting that getting rid of winter finally [laughter]
yeah yeah
yeah no kidding
that's uh kind of depressing to see all that
yeah
yeah y- it's something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and
you just adapt [noise]
to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between air-conditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh
i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh g- going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it must've been close to ten degrees above zero and
and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it'll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes
which do i want you know it's colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option
and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point
oh yeah frostbite [laughter]
yeah
oh yeah
it does
you can feel all the way through it's like a knife like a sw- like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever
yeah
oh well i don't know what else i can say about it [noise]
[laughter]
well i guess that's all i to say you too
have a good evening bye
[noise]
[noise]
it's been
pretty windy
yeah so far
yeah
oh yeah
oh really
uh-huh
right well you know they said that we haven't had enough rain though and that surprises me because it seems like we've had a lot of rain this year
but since we've uh last i heard that we hadn't met our you know hadn't got up to the right level yet that we
right well it truly surprises me because it seems like we
seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesn't accumulate too much
but um i'm glad it's summer
[laughter]
me too
yeah
i don't either i want some you know ski or something you know i'm benefiting from it
i guess [laughter] in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside
yeah
i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to
i do too
yeah yeah
true
that's true that's true it does seem to uh
uh-huh
uh-huh i do like um
like an old uh warm summer the breezes that it gets at night you know you can open your windows and
oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in that's nice
[noise] and that helps on utilities [laughter]
yeah and that's especially in Garland [laughter] it's real bad
yeah yeah well we didn't have much we had some good ice but not a lot thank goodness not
yeah sure have how about you [vocalized-noise]
are you serious
ugh
[noise] are you serious
um
gosh
boy that's horrible
ooh i hate that that's horrible
right know
well that's true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle
and um he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the next day it was up to seventy five [laughter]
yeah that would be horrible
i wouldn't like that [laughter]
well you just can't depend on it
yeah yeah it's just real comfortable here where we live and that's the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot summer and
you know it doe- it gets cold enough in the winter to where you
yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
i don't either
yeah yeah i wouldn't mind some you know like i guess after awhile in the summer when it hits i guess about October and you get a few cool days
i don't mind that because it kind of gives you some relief
you know that's nice
yeah
yeah they really are
yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass [laughter]
for a change i- i got i get sick of winter just looking everything so dead i hate that
so
yeah yeah it really is it's just an old gray looking sky and it's boring
really i guess it wouldn't be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn't be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow it's beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pretty but i sure couldn't live there
yeah
i guess so
warm [laughter]
i guess so
um
God
um
um-hum
[laughter]
that's right
yeah
hum
right
right
i don't blame you i would too
[laughter]
i do hate that feeling though it
yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them up and everything and and i still get it
i guess i can bare the cold it's just when it does the wind hits
oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone
[laughter]
yeah it hurts
exactly hurts i hate it
well me either
it's kind of a boring topic
i guess
all right then i'm through you too bye-bye
[noise]
well how about you do you use PCs
you and i both [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
well i have an i an IBM PS two model thirty
and uh it's kind of it's getting kind of too slow for me but my job i'm an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level
and i just use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors
i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine
so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also
huh-uh
huh-uh
huh-uh
yeah
yeah
yeah i've become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground
and there's uh three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other
just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and
so
i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC now i don't have one at home
wh- wh-
yeah i wou- right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home
um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot
to do work and if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter]
yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's just not fast enough for me
so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't know
i don't know if my boss will spring for it
but i'm i'm i'm
i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one
[noise]
yeah
well that's what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer
and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something
so the first thing when i started work at this bank was i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up
so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh yeah
a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer
and we can uh send ma- uh files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need
and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet
and [vocalized-noise] that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased
it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy
yeah i've i've got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own
so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office
yeah
they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer
but the quality is almost uh laser quality
and i think it's called the desk jet
and they're under i think they're uh about eight hundred dollars now
oh
huh-uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors
yeah
yeah use the sneaker net system
yeah
yeah we used to have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer
until they got off the machine
that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh
well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came in and bought up the rival and now N C N B's got a little larger market share
but it's the [vocalized-noise] it's the only uh
well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive
so any way i work in a in a big prestigious place
and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer
i was going oh wait a minute [laughter]
come on guys this is crummy
yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innova- innovation and lead the market
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to t- do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and
so
yeah
yeah
unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a
[noise]
oh constantly
[laughter]
it seems like uh everything i do ha- is computer related
and if it goes down then we're stuck all day
and so i like the IBM PC personally
but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's li- second nature
what do you use
yes uh-huh
oh uh-huh
huh-uh
uh-huh
oh okay
oh okay
oh we um we use an it's an IBM PS two also
and um
you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like
uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um
[vocalized-noise] graphics on it
and uh
a little with word processing and then l- uh lotus applications to it
and uh
uh you know i don't know i just
i enjoy working with them
there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] we have one at home but i just don't find the time that i can use it
i
[laughter]
yes uh
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh th- one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i
am pretty much the uh like you said the guru in the office uh with the uh the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is
and um
uh so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that uh in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so [laughter]
but uh you know it's uh
they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them
and oh
i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh
that's uh
pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things
and um
it uh you know compared to what the uh the way the things have upgraded have uh
really [vocalized-noise] they're what's the word i'm looking for
i'm just totally drawing a blank we just [laughter] but uh the way things have have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable as far as the things that we can do now and compared to what we could do you know
back a few years
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] we think about that a lot [laughter]
uh-huh
oh
um now that's awful
huh-uh
uh-huh
oh okay
um-hum right
hm yes
[laughter]
right the quality that you can put out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers
yeah
uh-huh
um uh we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer
and uh it's just so y- you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult
and
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
yeah
and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred
uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies
sometimes the color would take too long to pl- uh to plot out
so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick
because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it
but uh it uh
uh-huh
no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to to razzle-dazzle uh but uh
it's uh yeah we we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to had to change it uh put it on a disk
and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the [vocalized-noise] the printer
right [laughter] and uh wait for an opportunity to use it
uh-huh
i know [vocalized-noise] i [vocalized-noise] understand
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
right
[laughter]
[laughter] right
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind [vocalized-noise] you know the times in technology here
uh-huh
uh-huh
right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh
we work for a computer company and uh
how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete
and the the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good
so
um-hum
okay [laughter]
no i had to press one [laughter]
sure
uh-huh
i think we should have stayed longer
uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do
yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now And it's almost like they're killing each other off
and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all
well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um
well no i just mean that [laughter] the world in general [laughter]
yeah
Um
i don't know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did
yes [laughter] But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible
oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them so i really don't know what he said what did he say about it
uh-huh
we don't have the money for that
[laughter] It would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes [laughter]
[noise]
i'm sorry i dropped the phone [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
oh well you guys [vocalized-noise] you you have more flats don't you it's flatter out there
uh-huh
oh i didn't realize that
no huh-uh
only in Ohio
i've never been past Ohio
no huh-uh i've never seen anything out i never seen the great i've seen
i've never seen i've seen pictures of it but
i've never been there i've seen pictures i just i'm a college student and um
i'm paying for my own education and i'm i come from a large family and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in my family
so
oh my
[laughter]
uh-huh
really
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well um i'm i'm originally from Butler and that's about an hour away from where i am now i'm at Clairon And um it's it's pretty like windy and hilly
oh i couldn't even tell you
it's not like a mountain it wouldn't be like a mountain it's uh
oh i don't even know
i have no clue
[laughter] i would say it's closer to sea level
uh-huh
oh well see um [laughter]
uh-huh
um
uh-huh
uh the farthest away from home
probab- i'd say five or six
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my
oh my gosh
uh-huh
oh yes Now see for me that's a long ways
uh-huh
even well like i i'm in like a little town right now it's smaller than Butler and um
Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where i'm at and i'm about
i'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh
and uh [vocalized-noise] i mean just this this little town here here is basically a college town
the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
and and in the summer when we co- uh my fiancee's family lives up here we come up here in the summer and it's i mean there's just no one around
um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college
finance
uh-huh
uh-huh
um well like i said my fiancee
no [laughter] No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and i'd actually like to work for a company rath- rather than a bank or a something i'd rather work for a company
and um like be their financial advisor or something
[noise]
uh-huh
oh really
uh-huh
take a boom a little bit
well well what would be the unemployment rate out there
see that's what it is here too
uh-huh
yeah It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs
i know people that have been out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do
[noise]
was i supposed to do something
good uh let's see
so
uh
were we right in the Middle East
should we have been there
did we do what was correct there
should we have fought them harder
used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used
oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad
would that be so bad
was there anything there
to begin with
[noise]
it wasn't ours
well we've got to talk so it's just just as well we argue
i agree
wouldn't it have been wonderful
if we could have freed the country
yeah so other political things that's going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh
wanted to improve the highways
[noise]
oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and
turn it into
interstates like
the rest of the country
but wouldn't it be wonderful
and back east you all drive at fifty five don't you
what's that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five don't you see out here in the west
a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five
we drive sixty five oh yes well
i uh
last weekend went home to visit my parents my dad's in the hospital and uh
between
here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour
nonstop have you have you ever been out here
how far west have you been
oh you've never
you've never seen the great American desert
the Rocky Mountains
Yellowstone
[noise]
uh
[noise]
well my college educa- uh thirty six worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now
uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science
yeah i know it's a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh
down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and have
the gulf and
it's really interesting so tell me about where you live
uh how high is the highest elevation
like uh probably
three thousand foot
close to sea level
okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live
it's over six thousand foot
um
yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood
six [vocalized-noise] eight twelve hours away
you know just just for fresh i
i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America
how many hours have you been from home
yes
oh yeah
uh
now when i was growing up
in the Panhandle of Texas look at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo
fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour
when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but
uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hop in you know the car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours
[noise]
yeah it is i imagine
[noise]
okay okay i'll look at my map later
wow how neat
[noise]
so are you working your way through college
well how neat what's your major
finance
well that's interesting
so uh what do you plan to do with it
savings and loans uh [laughter]
oh that would be great that would be neat
let's see uh so we're all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town
yes the uh new employer in in the city
so we're expecting our local economy to
[noise]
uh maybe not boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still
uh
unemployment runs approximately six percent
but now under employment
i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent
and the problem is that
there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without
a technical four year degree
yes it is
[noise]
well who's the team
oh really well i i'm picking Duke because uh they just won it
yeah
it's just yeah it's just over just uh about f- ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think
either five or eight it was a good game
but uh Duke was just too much for them Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them
oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh
Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them
it was a good game
but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it
that's right that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys
but they they they fell i tell you
yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them
but
uh i i was since the
yeah that's right
yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems
i tell you
oh really
yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they
uh they can't hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind
but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him
maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year
they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman
and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills
and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh
just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big
oh uh
not McCrae but uh
let's see are you uh Perkins
they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a
yeah
and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae
yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played
he hadn't played in probably two months
and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to
so uh
it uh you know i i bet it was
that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh
yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him
and uh
you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think
Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were
and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money
but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you
uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh
oh what do you call i- all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh
shoot they've they've played terrible
and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick
because uh
there's no way they can e- i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now
so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick
or a
you know the Suns are are pretty good
they're uh
yeah and they d- they made some trades uh
oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good
white uh Chambers yeah and uh
you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because that guy can play
that Chambers is is something else
but uh
i don't know it'll it'll be interesting
i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard to keep up with them
but col- i really enjoy college basketball
[noise]
the most
no they sure didn't sure didn't
oh okay so you keep up with the
uh
yeah
more of a football powerhouse i guess
more of a football powerhouse up there i guess
is basketball pretty big
do what
i
tha- that's true that is right
yeah so that's a tough conference
huh
yeah because Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse
but uh
and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation
and uh we'll have to we'll have to see how Phoenix ends up
[laughter] you too bye-bye
[noise]
well i think uh NCAA is going to go to Kansas
they just won it
holy cow i just walked in i i didn't even i guess it's i can't believe it's over al-
what was the score
well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so
well you and everybody else
well a lot of pressure on them though i think uh
i don't think they had the same type of enthusia- -asm or attitude
probably too conservative or too
uh
yeah
yeah
well what about professionally
i'm out in uh Ph- uh Phoenix there so the Suns are starting to look pretty descent but there [vocalized-noise] i think yeah
yeah [laughter]
well i used to live out there and uh seems like they've well Tarpley just got pulled over again
[laughter]
who who else do they got on that team now i [vocalized-noise]
yeah
yeah
yeah how's he doing this year
how about the guy from North Carolina
Perkins Per-
that's right that's right okay
yeah he was a finesse player he was good
Dantely didn't they get Dantely
i think that was involved with the Pe- Perkins trade to tell you the truth
oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was
McGuire [vocalized-noise] yeah
yeah
i don't understand that i thought that he was always a good player
are they over five hundred
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
yeah i think i think the Suns are
well they had i don't think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year
did you say white or black
Chambers
yeah
he's the big guy yeah
i haven't been i don't follow basketball real close but
yeah
the big ten didn't fair too well in the tournament
i'm i'm from the [vocalized-noise] midwest so
yeah
yeah i kind of wa- you know see what's happening
but uh
what's that
well no basketball is you know Michigan won it last year
yeah Indiana and Michigan uh
and uh Iowa and
Ohio State Ohio State was ranked like number two most of the year [vocalized-noise]
Michigan won the NCAA last year and and you know there's always
about six teams that go to the tournament
uh from the big ten it's it's
they are they're really good in all the sports they
[vocalized-noise] actually in the last few years um
football you know looks like has gone down a little bit so
yeah
and uh
yeah we'll see
alrighty well uh have a good one
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
good morning do you have a c- a personal computer
oh [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point
uh without documentation so it was very cheap it's a two eighty six
so it has no hard drive
um so that's limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work
and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and
um i don't there's something about the Ma- a lot of things about the Mac i don't like i don't like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i don't like the keyboard but i- it's extremely easy to use
and it's very good for for graphics and actually i- i mean it's to the point where programs are ea- readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it
i have um uh it's not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that
right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen [laughter] but but it's somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens
and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all
and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper [laughter] and um [noise]
[noise] now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone
but um [noise] and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched
uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do
and um he no he's in international studies
so he's basically you know what- whatever the computer can do for you fine i'll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i'm not gonna be a guru [laughter]
um-hum
right
but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you're sure you did X
and it just doesn't work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn't do that because the computer doesn't [noise] doesn't balk [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
right and talk to them [laughter] and yell at them [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum um-hum
basically you're using it as a word processor you mean
and what would you do [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
right right
well it's been very interesting
okay
you too bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
yes i do i have um uh fifty megabyte hard disk on a so i got a i little you know lot of room for information i'm a [noise] i'm a programmer at work
so uh but i- i do all of my programming on the mainframe and i uh don't have a lot of opportunity to work on the PC except at home
so i find it very interesting how about you
um-hum
[noise] uh-huh
um-hum
[noise] oh that's great
do you like the Mac real well
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum [noise] i've i've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes
that's true that's very true
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum [noise]
[noise] is he interested in computers then did this give him an interest in it other than you know using it more as or less like a wor- a word processing machine he
as a tool um-hum okay
oh that sounds interesting too
[laughter]
uh-huh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you don't i think a lot of the people are afraid of them
uh are intimidated by them i guess more than anything until they get get to uh learn what they can do and and how it can work
so
uh-huh
[laughter]
[noise] that's right and e- even using it as much as i do you know and you'd you'd oh well i did that i know i did that you know and then the results come back and no you didn't [laughter] they catch you every time [laughter]
so anyway i guess you have to have a sense a humor too [noise]
when you're working with them
so um-hum yell at them and like to choke them so many times i wanna choke mine say you're not doing what i want you to do
but uh i- i have one mainly i bought it because i'm in uh taking a lot of courses along with work and [vocalized-noise] it's very useful in that respect but i hope to do something more with it [noise]
right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but uh not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more
[noise] i don't know [laughter] i know there must be something more i can do with it
[noise] but uh in my spare time someday i- i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a [noise] ideas but putting them into work is another story
[noise] so
anyway
well thank you very much for calling okay have a good day bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
now i'm sorry excuse me
and uh i do that we recycle uh newspapers we take you know the Dallas Morning News daily and the Plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers
it really does i do recycle newspapers and uh glass
we don't really have enough plastic to mess with we don't you know like we don't drink milk and we don't have children so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know
yeah
right
but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container
and uh Plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home and they ca-
it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up
which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know they can't get to the these centers
and i'm sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know
but i think that's probably a good idea
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh yes
yeah
great
[laughter]
i bet it was
uh-huh
uh-huh
sure
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
yeah it's just a matter of education i think
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah that's right
i think basically it's a good idea you know i hope it works
absolutely absolutely
right
uh-huh right
uh-huh
sure absolutely
and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i and it's amazing how much stuff j- just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five
it really does
as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth
that's right i was uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
uh-huh
yeah
[noise] uh-huh
i see
oh i'm sure it must yes [vocalized-noise] you know i'm not personally involved because i don't you know i don't have any [vocalized-noise] children that wear diapers but i'm sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse
that's right that's right
absolutely
that's right absolutely absolutely
uh-huh
i think they're made out of aluminum
yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don't we don't generate that much so we don't
yeah
that's right
that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
car batteries
uh-huh
i don't you know i don't change my own oil so i don't i don't uh don't have that problem
yeah
uh-huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact
right
yeah
yes we have one of those in town uh-huh
you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh
it's called the clothes closet that's what it's called here in Plano right uh-huh and they distribute them to the people that need them
uh-huh yeah
no i can't either [noise] i really can't um
no i i really can't either
okay well it was nice talking to you
-kay
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
there you go okay
right
oh i know it builds up really fast
yeah [noise] yeah
uh-huh
yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us
yeah
oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah
yeah
yeah
or it just builds up so often yeah
yeah yeah
they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable
so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic
um and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and th- they it just really e- e- every time you went by there it was just over flowing
and so Wal-Mart complained
so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be
oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and the- they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there
so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it
you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area
in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's uh i think once or twice a week
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message
yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going
they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be i don't think
[noise] yeah
yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little
um seedling to plant you know [laughter] you could take the the
mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought
yeah
oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast yeah
yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful
but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so
the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off
so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so
yeah
yeah
it does and you just feel guilty if you don't do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either
[laughter]
yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or
um
yeah
yeah we don't either
we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that but
yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car
or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash
yeah yeah
[noise]
yeah
well other than that i'm not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes
[laughter]
our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so
yeah yeah
oh
uh-huh kind of like a Goodwill kind of place yeah
yeah
yeah that's that's real helpful too
[noise] well i'm not sure of any- i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle
yeah
okay
you to take care bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i'm uh an engineer so i'm heartedly in favor of this country converting to metric
uh-huh
Yeah well i think uh you know from an elementary standpoint it would help to get rid of some of the the oddball conversion units like
twelve inches to the foot and
thirty six inches to the yard and things like that but uh i think uh from my work experience i found
well wh- in college
i learned uh to use a rationalized system of measure which turned out to be the metric system
and an awful lot of the problems that we did on exams and our homework assignments and everything else involved [vocalized-noise] converting
from uh English units or nonstandard units into this uh rationalized M K F system
and uh so i became quite accustomed to uh to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions
and since then i have discovered uh other engineers are very prone to make mistakes
because they will pick up a textbook and uh and find some formula for solving a problem
and they fail to realize that the formula is expressed in the the rationalized M K F system and they'll proceed to plug in inches and feet and pounds and uh [laughter] things like that and they come up with a funniest answers you ever you can imagine
and some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so uh you know a lot of energy and uh a lot of work and so forth uh goes into building something only to discover it doesn't work [laughter]
Yeah
Yeah
[vocalized-noise] i kind of agree that uh maybe ten on or twenty years ago we should have gone into a uh sort of a dual display arrangement where you know our our speed limit signs were
were sort of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour type uh marking on the side
and then over the years the the kilometers per hour gets bigger than the miles per hour and eventually disappears
uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh
uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way around the metric units are expressed first
and then the English equivalent that's uh is put into parenthesis for reference
yeah
you know i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit
[laughter] you've got to go out and buy a metric set
uh-huh
i was a little disappointed that uh United States is lagging the rest of the world but all of the other countries in the world have made the change and even the British which are probably the most stodgy
population and the originator of our English system of measure uh they have gone metric
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah
I
i think one of the other concepts that uh comes along with using a rationalized system of measure is uh a technique of keeping track of units
when you're solving a problem that if you're sitting there trying to uh establish a relationship with some physical system uh when you come up with your final formula if you analyze the units of measure they should come out right
and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass and electric charge
and so if you convert all your measure into those uh fundamental units and analyze them you can uh get a pretty good sense as to whether your formula is correct
maybe you left out a factor of pi or something like that but
Well i
most of them have uh the option the American American made cars have uh uh the miles per hour as the big scale and they're little tick marks uh sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers per hour
But those that are manufactured for sale in in Europe and so forth are quite the other way around
and in a lot of the Japanese cars that come to this country particularly those that have the uh electronic panels there's a little push button some place on the panel that you can switch between uh kilometers per hour and miles per hour
my wife's uh Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose what display you want to see
Yeah i noticed my van has a uh a button on the temperature gauge that you can switch between centigrade and fahrenheit
yeah
well we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start
to not use the English measure anymore like when you listen to the weather forecast the the weather man may give the temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit and everybody ignores the centigrade and listens to the fahrenheit to the fahrenheit
and we we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body temperature is thirty seven degrees centigrade [laughter] yes
and that it's a nice day when it's twenty five degrees outside [laughter]
yeah the Europeans think that you're baby is boiling over [laughter]
[laughter]
Yeah
no i hope we get to the point where maybe a couple of generations from now when somebody reads the old adage
i bet you are i bet you are i don't know you know when i was in uh when i was in high school several years ago you know we did probably
two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of basic math class a couple of semesters ago
and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was
uh it was wonderful i mean it was just incredible how much simpler it is than what you know i guess we just all have this mind set that oh this is so hard and we can't do this
and it's really not hard i was surprised at how very easy it was i think most people just uh
you know automatically have their minds set against it and don't give it a chance you know so
oh sure
exactly exactly
uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] it just don't work [laughter]
i bet i bet
right right well you know i think that the that the only way that we are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start other with with the kids right now
you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in sch- that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like when i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start
with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch
you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over
you know
uh-huh
yeah
yeah i agree
they'll
very good idea yeah yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i- [vocalized-noise] i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with o- with our kids i really believe that but you know
[vocalized-noise] we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it
you know i mean you would just you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school
you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're gonna have to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know
oh yes yeah
yeah yeah that's true too that's true
buy a whole knew metric set yeah
well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen
but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over
oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh
even they have switched yeah so yeah we're not uh we're not necessarily on the cutting edge in everything are we [laughter] just like we think we are
so well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't
you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you
there's really nothing to memorize there's nothing to learn it just all works the same you know you just you know transform that little you know dot from one place one one way to the other you know and that's about all you have to do so anyway i think it will happen eventually
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
right right
well you know i think uh i think it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what else i could suggest to them you know if they ask me what should we do
i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the ca- of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them
most of the new ones i'm seeing are are made with miles per hour and kilometers on them
oh really
right
uh-huh
right
is there really huh
well that's interesting yeah well
oh well that's interesting too i had never seen that yeah no you know you look at most of the you know like the bank clocks and stuff like that it tells you you know fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds of things you know switching you know [vocalized-noise]
getting us all accustomed to seeing both you know but most people don't pay any attention you know it's going to take some education right along with it most people don't know what that means you know so
that's right because that's what they're familiar with
right that's going to be hard to do it's going to be very hard to do you know you
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] i'm so used to saying oh my babies got a hundred and three degree fever and you know just say it's thirty nine is not just going to sound very bad [laughter] you know
[noise]
that's right that's right your baby's still alive with hundred and three [laughter] so you know it it's going to take a changing lot of our old prejudices and you know just
making up our minds that yes we are going to do this and we're just going to forgot this old way and we're just going to do it you know and i don't think the older generation is probably ready to do that you know
[vocalized-noise]
[noise]
okay Jay um
could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime
oh so that's
what do you do work in Plano
how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself
oh so it
yeah that's uh that's the same with me well um
i grew up in a rural area there's nothing but farms
and i still live in the same area it's it's built up somewhat and crime
really hasn't been a problem it's been uh
uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh
radios and cassettes and things like that
[noise]
not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it's Boston which is about uh
oh forty five fifty miles away
which is really not that far
and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am
[noise] but the cities down there yeah and and
and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence
and that they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight they're taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is
uh they'll somebody be driving along whether they're they're in their early twenty's or or teens
and they'll steal jackets they'll holdup kids and they'll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and
because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive
they just [laughter] that's that's incredible
yeah that's
yeah for a pair of tennis shoes
yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh
you know not to not to go out and scuff up and
but
i don't know what the it's
[noise]
it's probably the uh the times now um
i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and
yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just don't care
you know it's either it's either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head
or you starve
[noise]
yeah
yeah
we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh
the police made a raid on an- and most of them were teenagers or or
in their early twenties
which is unheard of in a small town
you know you don't usually associate associate that
but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset
but i'm not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent they're saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors
like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and
and going to school
is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy
you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don't work or if they work they work part-time for
minimum wage yeah
yeah i'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it's it's terrible
so you're still suffering then
as far as that goes
yeah
yeah i was down [noise]
i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week
and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in
it was just all lights
but you couldn't tell there was a problem
you know because it's so huge
pa- part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um
all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder
nobody's being prosecuted
so
right what's
yeah what's the what's the poor guy going to do that's that's you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support and he's got no job
um
i'm not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah
yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had uh
just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders
yeah i mean Rho- Rhode Island's just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it's just so so so small
and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care
yeah yeah
yeah and if it's if it's drug related they turn the other way because that's one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement
and uh if they do come in i've got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh and they let them out they're out on the street before they get their reports done
so there's no checks and balances
and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's going to go
yeah
they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean
the fire power against them now is is atrocious
you know they've got
all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do
and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law
um
i don't know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment
well
it's yeah yeah
yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there's no
yeah um
and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty
um that's like saying that
you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads
so i- it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty
and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do
[laughter]
ye- i- [laughter] yeah i wouldn't want to see it go that far
you know give them due process and then and then let them
and then let them appeal yeah then you'd get yeah because some of it some of it's it's it's just down right
uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody
and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual
um
yeah
yeah he can
[noise]
because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back
it was
they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore you know we're no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and
[noise]
i tell you what here in Dallas it's uh it's awful bad because that they're i i believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes
uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area
and uh that's that's getting that's getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh it's been a rude awakening i tell you
uh right right
well see it's it it's really just a suburb uh i really can't even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends
but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh
it's uh it's definitely a big change
right
i see
not really the violent crimes then
i see
i see
right
okay so that's real close
right
right
oh Lord
right
you know i've heard about that uh also for tennis shoes
there was uh uh [noise] a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes
yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range
and that just seems ridiculous
for a pair of tennis shoes yeah
so
that's right [laughter]
i don't know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem
right
exactly yeah just e- overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough
yeah
right
to get it yeah
well ano- another problem i think is the the drugs
you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and
and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it
right
right
right
exactly
right
yeah it's hard to get a job you know
right
you know we really haven't uh because the oil industry just hasn't come back like it was
and so much of our economy was based on that
so
yeah yeah
right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were
and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while
i see
right
[laughter]
right
right
and
right
that's right
what's going to stop them from you know other people to
well that's true too yeah yeah
but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something's got to be done on that
because
right
golly that's ridiculous
right
right
they just overlook that as uh common occurrence
right
oh that's
golly that's terrible isn't it
right
well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street
as far as the officers and things like that but uh
i think yeah that's true
and uh
right
so i don't know
well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've i've got to believe that
in the back of their mind if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they're going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen
you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh
right
you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just
i just don't understand that
but
right that's true yeah
right
right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just
[laughter]
and then do it huh [laughter]
that's right
right
exactly
exactly and and
you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes
so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and
right
[noise]
so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago
[noise]
well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that so
oh that's right that's one of the changes [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise] yes
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh uh-huh
and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons did it work
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
so there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual m- lots of individual movements [noise] in a sense
the me decade uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
well that i've been aware of i've
at least in my own circles i've been aware of an increasing from my generation i don't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off i guess um
i've noticed uh
a certain increase um pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top [vocalized-noise] i had the impression
[noise]
well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially [vocalized-noise] you know a socially conscious adult and
i realize that people of my age have no um
no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense and i
and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental
they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population
and there's just instead there's been sort of an increasing oh i don't know Japan bashing and things like that
and uh a lot of i see
among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know America's losing it
and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowl- uh a lack of understanding how that could be
and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um
so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um
and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement
and sense of corporate respons- increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future
in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesn't
can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism but
you know basically things are [vocalized-noise] the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and there's a notion of fairness that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think
[noise]
uh-huh
oh of course [laughter] it's human nature [laughter]
[noise]
yeah yeah
uh-huh yes [laughter]
uh-huh yeah yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh [noise] right
and that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else [laughter] i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it but much of it did i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing
yes yes
uh-huh
a perceived decline anyway yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the
role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been
poorer and poorer over the years uh you know that there's been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living and you know it's just more and more uh
[vocalized-noise] a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude it's
hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education
and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago [laughter] um
uh yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote not vote that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years um yeah twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years
um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight
and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action
and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people
and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself
um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated
and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company
uh the problem was that my hair was too long
and uh that you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and
[noise] if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years
and that's basically where i ended up i uh i just flat out couldn't get a hold you know [vocalized-noise] get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action um
on other fronts um
um i think so i- i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine
and uh [noise] it's i think they're they're like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i i've kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh
as far as uh as their management goes um i'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise
but uh other changes um
just
people seem to be more
outspoken now individually rather than collectively um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home and things were more organized
and uh i've noticed that
now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together
um
yeah i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade [vocalized-noise] and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us but um it it
it's i've seen uh
uh a great deal of change as far as um
corporate responsibility and things um
and
people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more
and what ab- what about the last ten years that you've been aware
uh-huh
yes
[noise]
yes
[vocalized-noise] but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um
there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know [vocalized-noise]
you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't you know it's just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent
[noise]
and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i- i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um
it's it's been a long time coming um being a uh a very old hippie um [laughter]
i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life [laughter] [vocalized-noise] no matter what you do and i- i just
i've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day
and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and
you know all that stuff at home and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast
yeah
like
yeah
and then they
turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war
and now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot i think the uh the other part about uh America's decline i think has to do with
yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system
uh i have children in in s- i have three children in school right now and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh
my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong
and words spelled wrong not marked as such
and this person's teaching my children
you know i had a real problem with that
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a uh a uh
a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system
for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools
so that the teach
do you
uh-huh
sure
well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil or or the Texaco Pennzoil problem
uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved
should handle cases like that
oh is that right
yeah oh boy or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury
uh i was only on one jury ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over this
case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was it was
really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money
and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case
they wou- they had settled while we were deliberating
now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case
and uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a good thing that [laughter] it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial
uh-huh
well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money
uh-huh
sure
yeah
yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded
and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the defendant
ah on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies
and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants
and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury
that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence
so uh i do although i'm a lawyer's daughter and i have lawyer's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really
think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice
uh-huh
well and then in a lot of
yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime
yeah and now it's possible that he didn't commit this one but the likelihood is certainly tilted
with a record like that and uh that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony
had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag
and he came in
and was presented to the court as a fine upstanding young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest and yeah
you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence
and you know it's it's really annoying when the i asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in
he said that that was barred uh by the court
so
we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over
and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where
yeah
yeah that would be helpful
sure would
um
um
and you think that would be relevant
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah right
uh-huh i think so and uh and
yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen
and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge
but particularly the witnesses
or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words
yeah i can remember uh
friends of daddy
[noise]
well this is kind of ironic because i work in TI's legal department
and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time
and uh when was it a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty i i wasn't selected but um
for some of our cases in particular we have um uh very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such
and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not
yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury um
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
oh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel
but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom
some their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself and
yeah
but it's a shame that
oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get
scared enough by going to the court and usually it's the s- it's the scare kind of of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel you could feel that you really have a very strong case
and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little antic- you know anxious there and go well you know
i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee [laughter]
uh-huh
um
oh really
uh-huh
yeah
oh is that right [laughter]
yeah and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law
um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of
if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
[laughter]
jeez
um
[laughter]
yeah i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh
um lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah you know
yeah i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh
uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and
but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee you know that's
yeah you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know
but they never told us why these two people hated their themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive
given and and i had a tough time with that and and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom
at the end of it all i still didn't know [laughter] i still have a lot of reasonable doubts and i've seen everything presented
and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking
i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions
here [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
right
yeah allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after uh each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back
right
[noise]
so what kind of camping do you like
so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots [laughter]
yeah well i'm i'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper i'll uh
whatever i can carry on a backpack it was
is is what i go with
um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota
and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go camping
and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way
but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um
uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees
and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything
and it was right next to a nice cold stream
so it was my favorite place
and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the weather starts getting funny it will be warm one day and freezing the next
so but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever
well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the car and took off
and i got up there and got camped or got got my camp setup
and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing
yeah
oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater
um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent
i'm going oh no
i go out i had all my stuff se- i had my little campfire thing setup and my
pots and pans and stove and all that
and i get everything's buried under snow so i'm out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i'll go i'll go play around for a while
well there's this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they're cold anyway
so here i am going across this snow encrusted log
and i slipped and fell in
and crashed through the ice right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going [vocalized-noise]
uh
well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn't try to twist or anything
and as i went i just turned and stuck my arms out and i hit the hit the log with my arms
and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under
um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing
yeah so i i
trotted back to the car rather quickly
uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back [laughter]
it was
i think i almost did that was something
yeah i i enjoy camping i like getting out
especially i don't i don't understand these peop- people take these camper trailers and stuff i mean that's that's not camping i mean that's like
yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV's and air conditioning
i mean good grief that's not camping
i like to rough it
no usually i went by myself it was sort of get away from everybody time
and you've been locked up with folks all winter it's time to get away by yourself
and it was so it was so nice up there that just
i mean it was so
quiet and peaceful
yeah it's nice nice area
[laughter]
yeah she fooled you
uh i've got three kitty cats and they were suppose to be taking a nap and
one just crawled up in my lap and every time she hears me on the phone she's got to come sit in my lap
got to be got to be part of the action here
oh
yeah all my all mine are uh purebreds so i keep them in
yeah especially
especially
especially this one
she's a mess
aren't you kitty cat
sort of like TI exclusive
yeah
have you had many calls
[laughter]
well i tell you it's it's it's easy to do it's just uh like when i started calling you it was two twenty my time one twenty your time i guess
and however long it took however long we've been on that's how long it took for some for the computer to find somebody
yeah i've been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here
yeah
i didn't think it would take as long as it does but like last night when i made one
the lon- that was the longest one i waited thirty five minutes
and sometimes you'll get it on the first try i mean it's just
yeah this is not a real good time of day because most people listed their home numbers and of course they're gone
but i've got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way
this is this is my thirtieth call
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah the only reason i'd do it is because i want to make sure that i get all my calls in before they they just up and pull the plug on the program you know
yeah because being a student i'm doing it for the money
and uh i wanna
i want to make sure i'm i'm my roommate does it too
yeah
it'll be a nice little bit of money we're going to
[laughter]
well of course there's this other one that i've i've talked to fairly regularly in Dallas um same thing her husband signed up for it and she's the one that does it [laughter]
[laughter] but he'll spend the money i bet [laughter]
yeah we're going to take the money and get uh go out and find a nice stud for Himy Persian
yeah she's a she's a beauty we're going to going to get a nice litter off of her
yeah she's she's so sweet too
yeah
uh-huh
yeah that's that's bit a prob- i mean you could always buy a uh you could always buy a Sphinx
those are hairless cats of course they're
oh they are they're they're loads of fun that's the most playful cat around
but they on the other hand too they cost twenty five hundred dollars
[laughter]
yeah my my roomy wants to buy a a Sphinx
and i keep saying no no no
no
we both decided on a Devonrex though it's sort of like a Sphinx it's a very short haired cat
it's almost like just fuzz
but uh they're substantially cheaper
we're we're into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he
yeah as long as you don't lose sight that they're still kitty cats
and they're fun to have around
this one here is just sweet
she's kneading on my my stomach [laughter] pushing and pushing and drooling
quit drooling on me look at this i'm wet
oh
that's it all right it was good talking to you
talk to you later Janet bye-bye
[noise]
well we uh as a little girl i used to go camping with my family and uh we'd load up our car and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff and
the place that we went the most often was uh in Oklahoma it's about a two or three hour drive and it is a little bitty national park right in the right in a town called Sulphur Oklahoma
and it was real pretty had lots of trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun
[laughter] yeah probably so
uh-huh
oh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
huh
uh-huh
yeah
[laughter] yeah
uh-huh
oh my goodness
did you have uh very warm sleeping bag or
oh my goodness
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah oh yeah
oh no
oh no
oh
oh
oh no
how did you get out of that
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
oh man
oh that's awful
oh my goodness [laughter] oh that's quite an experience i probably would have had a heart attack and died right there on the spot
[laughter] oh that
i bet
yeah
yeah
yeah that's just like moving to another area for a while [laughter]
yeah
yeah
i know [vocalized-noise] it's kind of funny
yeah well did you go camping by yourself then you didn't go with other people or
huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah well that's nice
yeah just a second
uh when i uh planned my little uh schedule of when i could talk on the phone this one was suppose to be asleep [laughter]
and she's not cooperating [laughter]
yeah i think so
oh
[laughter]
yeah wants you to
[laughter] my kids want a cat so bad and uh i'd i'd like to get them one but we live close to a busy street and almost everyone has a cat it's been hit run over maimed you know and i just can't stand the thought of it
so
yeah keep them in the house
well that may be our only option if we ever get one
huh
huh
well
this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're
yeah TI people yeah and so i just figured no it's just this area you know
well that's interesting
well you're my third one and i have never gotten the courage to do it myself isn't that funny [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
for it to
oh my
oh i never thought about that that it would take a long time to find someone available
uh-huh
oh my goodness
yeah i guess it depends on the time of day too
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh wow
that's great well i got a catalog that you know shows all the gifts and things you can get and
i started getting inspired thinking oh we need to do this i'd like to have a few of those things [laughter]
yeah
that's right and they probably will soon so
yeah yeah i can see that
huh well that's pretty neat
well
yeah yeah every time i've talked to one of them my husband said i can't believe that you made five dollars every time you do that it sounds easy [laughter] so he signed up to do it but he's never done one so
[noise] i know
yeah i know it's crazy [laughter]
that's right yeah he'll say yeah i did that
oh
well that will be neat
oh i tell you my kids would love to they'd just want any kind of a cat bless their hearts
and like i said um i really would like to have one too because i know how much they want one It's just hard one my youngest daughter has asthma and uh been a little afraid to have a cat in the house all the time with a child that has asthma
so i thought well i need an outdoor cat but if i have an outdoor cat i'm afraid it's going to get hurt so
i have a problem [laughter]
yeah
huh huh i don't think they'd be too fun
are they
huh
oh my land i'd be scared to death to have anything that expensive [laughter]
huh
oh i've never heard of that
yeah
huh
huh
yeah i would hope so
well that's good
yeah yeah
yeah i guess so
oh that's neat
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
well it was nice talking to you i think i'm going to have to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy when i'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do
yeah you too
okay thanks good-bye
[noise]
okay do you want to go first
fitness and exercise
okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling
and just walking uh and swimming i- i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall
and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit
thirty eight
uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to
really
ooh
oh i bet that helps
um-hum
yeah
yeah
that's right that's right
that's right
well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do
this is true
well now at
i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center
yes
it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year-round
um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center
[laughter] um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet
you need to put that on there seriously
oh you don't
oh
yeah
yeah
this is true
yeah
well it's not a
now what year are we talking about
okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then
yeah you know we still don't have day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it
yes yes
ooh
my gosh
could you hold the phone for one second thanks
[noise]
okay i'm back
wow
of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back
really
yeah
yeah
yeah really
yeah
there you go
i- i can believe that
oh yeah flex time is great
i- i can understand i can understand well it's been good talking with you
yeah
oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month
yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal
yeah
uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge
yeah it is
well or or a depe- or a dependent of one
really
[noise]
wonderful
yeah
oh yeah it's great
uh well it would depend on when you go it's not it's not excessively crowded on the weekends
oh i don't think that would be bad at all if you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site
oh well then you could go ei- either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more
niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there
well i'm good i'm glad well thank you you have a good day bye-bye [noise]
well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as as what was the topic
oh God [laughter] No why don't you go first
hm [laughter] well let me ask a personal question how old are you
oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop [laughter]
oh well you're lucky then because i've battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three that's when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics
religiously do water aerobics
i used to do [vocalized-noise] about six times a week and now i'm down to about four
but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh- in in there uh [noise] i tried weight training [noise] and i'm telling you you just i just can't lift the things
and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and
trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are [noise]
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way
to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd
so i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it
[noise]
[noise]
yeah but you have to have an indoor pool [noise]
so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water and that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training
and that does look very odd in the water
no and you know that's about the only place i haven't tried and people have told me now that's the Texan facility
i have been told that thing is just lovely
huh ha- now do you use that facility a lot
hum do you know if they have child care there
[laughter]
[laughter]
they don't i don't i don't work at TI
no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh
uh [noise] me and the uh insurance ad- adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh
i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and
never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and
boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know and it's not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified
we're talking nineteen seventy eight
they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages
i understand i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care and uh the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was uh scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um
i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure
and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that's when i go into labor that's like four and a half months and i don't even know it
oh yeah very easy ah very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to
to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor i think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar
bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff
and i'll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated
until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what
the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and uh
you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was [vocalized-noise] this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go
and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that
but i- i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things
i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again [laughter]
but let me ask you this since you use Texans how much is it a month
now is that for an individual
that's it
now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking
God that's cheap
that's really cheap
do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or
or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days it's offensive to me [laughter] alrighty well i i'm seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence
yeah [laughter] so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think i'm going to go contact Texans
i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time
huh alrighty when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell
see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty
oh i i'm actually right on the Plano line
yeah
oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here [noise]
you can go back to work now [laughter]
thank you
bye-bye
[noise]
alrighty [laughter] um
well i uh h- have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things um
a- as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not
you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that's the main problem at this point
how about yourself
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
that's true
uh-huh
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up
and uh and not really get down to teaching what's important
teaching these kids you know how [vocalized-noise] really the basics is what it comes down to
is that right
huh
i remember [laughter]
[laughter]
and talk yeah
huh
yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service
employees that there are and yet they're so important
uh-huh
right
well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh [laughter] that's bad word [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] there's an idea [laughter]
run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh i'm in Texas too so [laughter]
well gee
well me too i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there but
we'll s- maybe do our small part to fix them up
all right you too bye
[noise]
well in the norman i- in the normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first
all right i'm uh live in Plano Texas and uh um
uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today
so uh i mean when you when you take uh
uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to
to get that major subject in line something's wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the
they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but
uh it's just a shame to me tha- that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being
i have a i have a a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test
that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that's saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that
um um matter of fact i'm very content to send my daughter ou- out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i'm
my my opinion i thi- i think there's a big concern uh hope- hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh
i don't know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product
um-hum
exactly i- i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed
ha- they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the President's uh Fitness Education Program's all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school
and yeah and uh i'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who's uh goes to uh
one of the Plano s- high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting
over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean th- th- the kids sit there and they dr- and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for l- for lunch and then go out there and lift weights
and don't learn anything it's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline
um-hum
i used to
i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they wou- that she was paid true she was young you know but still it's the principle of course if she got her Master's degree it'd all be different but uh
[vocalized-noise]
oh taxes lord forbi- f- lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem [laughter]
[laughter] maybe i should run for office huh [laughter]
this is true
that's funny that's funny
[noise]
well that's about all i have here
yes ma'am
surely i've enjoyed it bye bye
[noise]
that's right
[laughter]
get sick with the flu [laughter]
uh-oh
wow are these disc brakes
right
well i have a Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those
redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars
is expensive uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
you're very fortunate [laughter]
well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently
and there's some kind of a boot that h- had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on
and my
uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning
it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but
that that was the reason i had to replace mine
right
[laughter] you would hope so but [laughter]
that you can't turn
that's right [laughter]
[laughter]
i've seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldn't want to go over them [laughter]
you do that yourself
oh you're
that's right
i've thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil [laughter] but and that would help a little bit but i haven't done it
oh no [laughter]
oh
that's crazy [noise]
that is mean
[laughter] or take it to the pit [laughter] and let them let somebody else do it [laughter]
they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change
when i know what the oil costs
right uh-huh
right
uh
well
right some of the stations around here will take it
i think maybe they have to accept it
recycle it
that's right um [laughter] we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother
and we were driving my husband's Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he c- came back out
and the car the truck wouldn't stop i mean it wouldn't start
so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and
[noise] it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor probably and he was going to take it off and
either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said i've got good news and bad news [noise]
uh the starter motor is fine it woul- it just had a
couple of bolts that held it in place
and one had been broken off
and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't
match just right [vocalized-noise] and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a
garage and pick them up pick the bolts up for him [laughter]
so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and
had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn't believe it because the man could have really stuck us [laughter]
no it [noise] was great
okay Greg
okay thank you bye
[noise]
yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don't uh don't like i guess because it's usually expensive and uh people end up
not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um
put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i- i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i
got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of fluish type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and
need the car the next day type deal so
yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and
and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular job for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars
yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn [noise] it down and and
put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and
um-hum
um-hum
yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those
that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and
i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them on myself
but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually
um-hum
um-hum
oh boy bet that got warm
yeah
yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there
hum i don't know what the
what the solution for that would have been you would have thought [vocalized-noise] they'd have put all those parts that were pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze [laughter]
that would be nice if uh all that was
huh that's interesting
yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about people that
go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the South that's
it's a little bit different
yeah that's true
that's true
well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so
we do that kind of maintenance and
yeah do the oil chan- oil and filter and air filters and
spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control
um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and
yeah
well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i- i recall a a uh
coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to
uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick
and she did it oh and it was just
that was mean
yep
so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in
yeah
yeah those have really cropped up uh years of late but uh
yeah yeah that's
that's true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and
and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters [noise] when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days
end up having to take it somewhere
right
well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor
in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on [laughter] we'll take your money
um-hum
right
um-hum wouldn't catch right
hum
yeah
well that's not
yeah that's true
that's not to bad then
well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll
go see what they need [noise] and we'll maybe talk to you again [noise]
um bye
[noise]
[noise]
well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night and i thought i'd make one tonight
that's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat
uh-huh [laughter]
i like it
no it's just as boring
[laughter]
i read a book while i'm doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike
i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout and i'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i'm going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled up
[noise] and those are going away
so that's real good
we got it at a little bit of an incline
uh this one yeah this is five hundred
i know they get cheaper but i don't know [noise] uh-huh
well i hope so
[noise]
[noise] yeah i didn't buy it really my husband bought it because we we'd
we'd never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but
besides that uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
i think your voice sounds familiar
where do you wo-
i wonder if we talked before
i'm in Garland
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night
uh-huh
[noise]
[noise]
let's see education [noise] uh social changes that we've seen in the last ten twenty thirty years yeah that one was
[laughter] the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner
[laughter] the other woman didn't cook too much either right
yeah they do i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education and she was
uh-huh she retired but
yeah and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in Virginia about different things yeah
uh-huh one was about painting
when was the last time you painted something did you feel like you did a good job did you feel uh
rewarded while you were doing it i don't know
i don't know
[laughter]
hum-um
well how'd you find out about it
how did you find out about it
uh-huh
uh-huh i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at TI and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
well if you work for TI you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash but then on the letter it says cash or prize
i don't know gobs
this is going on my fourth week to do it
well like what tell me
yeah
for how many calls
does it say
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
you need to start the grill
[noise]
no i'm trying not to he's telling me to start the grill [laughter]
so it's not all stuff that TI makes
[laughter]
[vocalized-noise] uh you mean the clocks
yeah
oh God
did they mail that to you or he brought it to you
huh
yeah so you're bound to find something you want
yeah
well you know uh
well do you know you have a ten limit a
ten minute time limit and then well that's okay and then they come on and tell you and they they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye
[laughter] we'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else let's see
oh i tried exercise classes and i never would go we find we joined ex-
yeah
uh-huh
they don't either well
well the first one i joined they went out of business and they transferred it to another one that was really far away
uh-huh and we were going to do it there was four of us together well then forget that it wasn't near me
and then the second time i was going to do it at Richland College and we i just get with another friend and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place [laughter]
[laughter] so my husband's just discouraged me on those things
oh yeah my husband said he's never joined a course right and i got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend that didn't last long i got one of those after i had a baby i think [laughter]
[noise]
[laughter] definitely two
[noise]
oh Lord you're lucky well i've got a stepdaughter she's in college
so there's where the money goes [laughter]
where's you ki-
two
we
uh
where you going to school
and what are you doing
yes i do i just got my certification huh-uh
the test is a booger [noise] it the test the exit test it's hard it is so hard
see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while
but i've heard they're terrible
bilingual is just horrendous i've had friends fail that twice
[noise] good
yeah right after you get out
[noise] boring and they really don't help you a whole lot now see i went to ET and i took one course through TWU
but
[noise] most of the good training i've got has been through Dallas just teaching ESL see i'm a Chapter One Teacher and some of my classes are ESL
well i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom but it usually's holding clothes [laughter]
[laughter]
right
well that's not why i got it right [laughter] how do you like your tread mill
you don't get is it less boring than the bicycle or not
[laughter] you watch TV or something while you do it
oh
yeah i do that too
really
are you a
yeah
really
uh aren't they k-
are they kind of expensive
ooh
oh do they probably the more you pay though the better the machine you have
well you ought to believe that anyway right
during the year well yeah well in bad weather you know well you'd have to do something inside do you work at TI
not
really
i live in Arlington
where do you live
no uh well
oh really
uh no this is the first time i've done it uh
my husband was just running out the door he's working at night tonight so i decided to do it [laughter] i haven't talked before
uh what subjects have you talked about
[laughter]
well that's interesting
it's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right
[laughter]
oh my goodness
[laughter]
they really have a lot of variety
oh a a school administrator well that could that would have been interesting
really well that's neat
um
hm
[vocalized-noise] how long is this going to go on do you know
i don't either it's interesting though i never heard of such a project before
pardon me
oh i don't know i guess my husband got a letter at the office
i i presume and they must have been asking does your husband work with TI
oh really
uh-huh
are you a
oh so they wanted any anybody don't have to work at TI
well that's interesting i had no idea that was just for the employees and i couldn't understand i kept getting these calls i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called TI you know there is Texas Industries and different things
i kept hanging up on them for days until my husband told me what it was [laughter]
i didn't know
yeah they
really
oh
well the prizes are pretty nice the uh he brought a booklet home and depending on how many calls i think three was the minimum but it went up to i don't know nine or ten how many calls have you ma- had
well it sounds like a lot
oh my and some of the prizes were you know pretty nice but i didn't
oh i wish i had that booklet here oh i think i do it's right here uh
i'll look at the end because those would be the best ones okay
uh
well they have some watches that look really nice there's a one that's got some diamonds on it
well
it says F i haven't quite figured that out i thought it was eight or nine but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls doesn't it
it says
when we have enough calls from you you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem
for gifts are you listening to him
okay it says
oh [laughter] it says three for a B gift five for a C gift et cetera
and this only goes up to F
so i thought that was somewhere around nine
but anyway it's got these beautiful watches on it let me see what else it has a uh
uh clock radio that also plays uh
[vocalized-noise] uh you know uh
tapes then it's got oh some binoculars and some pretty brass lamps

i know i know i know how are those ESL courses i'm just starting this summer
you're kidding
uh-huh
oh they give you
yeah
oh oh
okay what types of music do you like to listen to
i like classical music also i uh like you i don't know a whole lot about it and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but i'm not sure
which composers or which [vocalized-noise] it is that i really like so i kind of hesitate to buy something there are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i don't
[laughter]
yeah
yeah i understand that
uh no not really My husband is but not i do uh the world a favor and i don't sing aloud to anybody but myself [laughter]
yeah i
yeah i i don't care for rock at all i guess i'm real old fashioned
in my musical tastes
yes
right
yeah
yeah i agree with that too
[laughter] yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter] crops up every so often i listen to um the Christian radio station when i'm in the car K L T Y
and i like to listen to some of that music
yeah
uh-huh
yeah where do you live
ah i thought maybe you lived in Dallas because that's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh they're playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
my husband likes uh Sandy Patty songs he likes to sing those in church he'd buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on it if he had the money to
well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church
yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job
no not yet we're expecting a baby in July
i guess we'll start listening
yeah maybe so we'll start listening to children's music [laughter]
yeah there are
uh-huh
oh uh [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh
[laughter]
that yeah that sounds really cute
uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff
what
uh-huh
huh
how strange
uh-huh babbly i'll say that is [laughter] well we'll have to keep up with that then [laughter]
uh-huh
huh
right yeah have something to rebel against [laughter]
yeah that's good yeah variety is good
well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you
um well thanks um bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the [vocalized-noise] the music i enjoy the most how about you
right
uh-huh
i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there's one in particular that
is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else [laughter]
because naturally that isn't their taste
at this point in time anyway
are are you involved in music
[laughter]
[laughter] well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and
my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style so
[laughter]
no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious
it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around
but um but the more popular music i don't care for usually
um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular
rock and roll kind of thing
although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again [laughter]
isn't that the truth it's funny in fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up
in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back
and you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff
um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that i was
a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something
then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better
well they did it again about [laughter] two or three years ago and i laughed again i said oh no here we are [laughter]
right right it does indeed
uh-huh
yes now that there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the pro- problem that i found um in this area is that the
there there is inconsistency in the quality
here if you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality
you know uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland
yeah [vocalized-noise] and it
uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um
now my children have have sometimes um well they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and
the- when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard and you know i enjoy that
oh wow
yeah that's nice so is your husband a singer
right yeah
well that's a good thing to do
that's nice uh well do you have children
well wonderful that'll be a musician
[laughter] oh there's some wonderful Christian uh children's tapes
you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um
i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um
very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy
um there's one that's um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect
and uh she's playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute
yeah
yeah right
yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music
uh or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um
even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i [vocalized-noise] when i was around the house i played that music too
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodious in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny [laughter]
right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music
the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um
this same child um really listened t- to more um ballady or um
pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the uh real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to
and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore [laughter]
right [laughter] but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that
yeah
well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby
bye-bye
okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah i know how you feel about that that's true
[noise] what's what's uh what's the best part of your game do you think
um-hum
what is your worst then
[laughter]
well i think [noise] i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven't been out this year it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway
[laughter]
for you know with drives and stuff um
um-hum
yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh
and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've i've got a friend of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um
yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that [vocalized-noise] for a while hurt more than it helped um because i i and it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that
um
even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was
you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because you know it was [laughter]
it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went f- for my first lesson
the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down
and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do [laughter] so
oh yeah i was [laughter] feeling real good then so so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh
uh
[noise]
well that's like i said
oh yeah
ah oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know [noise] teaching have a have a lesson or something is that yours or mine
[noise]
all right
okay [noise]
what's that
oh yeah
well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean
i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i [vocalized-noise] was uh [vocalized-noise] i used to live out in Midland Texas i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place
[laughter] but uh
yeah i- i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don't know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three
and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know
because i'm not you know that's one of my problems is uh is controlling my my uh my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens
so do you do you like watching it though i mean
yeah well that's that's exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh
and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah
yeah because i- because i ended up into an inverted C where the uh the weight was on the wrong foot or something so
i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing
yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a half backswing
uh my friend says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right [laughter]
so i don't know it's going to be interesting
um that's probably true
well
oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it [laughter]
oh [vocalized-noise] that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh [noise]
you know
um-hum
[laughter]
you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess
[noise] well i think that's about it
yeah i do too
yeah
well you take care all right yeah good luck
[laughter]
bye
[noise]
[noise]
oh i'm definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but
oh i like to uh think putting is probably my uh
forte
[laughter]
i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about you
yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slice and so forth but i think i've overcome a good deal of that
[laughter]
yeah
i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it
oh really
[laughter]
built that confidence right up there huh
that can be bad i mean you know they a lot of people say
it's best to take your lessons right at the beginning before you learn the bad habits i guess
[noise]
i think that's mine [vocalized-noise]
let me just quick catch it and i'll be back
[noise]
i'm back
[noise]
yeah uh
they uh
[noise]
my uh i have an interesting anecdote
[laughter]
my uh my uh son who goes up to A&M he's uh had the pleasure of having a hole in one
yeah
yeah well i guess there's a certain amount of luck in any hole in one
oh thank God i've never been to Midland
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
yeah
well one of my uh well control
and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are but
this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing
yeah
that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me
yeah
yeah if i can convince myself not to try and kill it i sure you always get a lot better results
yeah
well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times
it's a frustrating game golf
[laughter]
it's getting more expensive unfortunately too
like you i haven't played any or not much this year i played couple of times but
i went out skiing in February and uh took uh little tumble down the slopes and uh so i'm nursing a wounded wing right
[noise]
yeah
yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it
[laughter]
okay [vocalized-noise] enjoyed it
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
okay [laughter]
oh i think i think that the um woman's role has come a long way we've gone more into the business aspect of uh
like i say of i don't know working more and then and we i think we've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also
uh with the pay and everything you know
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
oh and a lot of times you can't yeah
um-hum
yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work
uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn't believe in she's very old fashioned she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yeah uh-huh
yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she's kind of right with it when both
um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away f- that's that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work
you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and wi- yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
yeah
well w- what do you think about that do you think that um
wh- d- what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business
i
uh-huh
uh-huh
um-hum
or they won't be as good as they could be
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
exactly
uh-huh
um-hum
oh my
[laughter] Bless you [laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah i i agree
uh-huh
and they just enjoyed the income the extra
um-hum
um-hum
exactly
oh i know
uh-huh
um-hum
exactly
um-hum
see yeah see now um my parents there's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um
so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left f- and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and
like w- i don't have a car because i'm paying for college if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because
um-hum
yeah
um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance
well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade
and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know wh- i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor
you know
[laughter] well if they do they don't know of it you know [laughter]
uh-huh
oh i know
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
um
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think
i i r- i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it
i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion
i think it'll be freedom of choice
uh-huh
exa- yeah
um-hum
yeah
i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i d- i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice
um-hum
i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice
i do
um-hum
and and different circumstances call for different things
[noise]
[noise]
if you want to go first go ahead
yes definitely
well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know [vocalized-noise] the the higher echelon
because if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman
you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental [laughter] and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that
in one sense um i- i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today
you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore
i- most of the ti- you know e- even if you want to say home you c- you really can't
i- i- i-
y- you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff
uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know
so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we ha- we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too
oh God love her
yeah
that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then y- you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great
but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know
uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because they don't have the family roots anymore
you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be
you know in that sense
oh definitely
that's right
they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family
that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today
that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them
that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent
uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh
right tha- that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job
i- it's not like something that they really wanted
like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them
i'm not sorry i had any of them and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them
you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible
in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore
and it was because i had worked for about nine months
and when they were coming home i was going to work
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out
so we were i i felt i was losing my family
and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift
and i worked that shift for eleven years
yeah
yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home
you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad be- because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that uh we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there
and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men weren't here anymore
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence
exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries
and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes
and we had to walk before we had a car
and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car
and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country
we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but
i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me
you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you
and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way
of course
yeah
sure
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher
you know y- y- and your self esteem and the w- the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense
than these kids that don't have that responsibility
you that that [vocalized-noise]
sure yeah
sure they probably don't even have any
or yeah exactly
and that's what i say y- you'll b- you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there
and no one can tell anyone anything any- you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen
you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know
[laughter] just attention you know
but really uh wh- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing
women in politics and
president someday maybe [laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah
well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear
then i mean a- all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know
but uh
yes yes
which i mean i think it should be anyway
no
yeah because i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business
and uh
exactly exactly that's
[noise]
okay um do you have a credit card
[laughter]
i know i've got one um i i did have two and
the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one
um
i don't know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right up
and now i've after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i'm still paying it off
i don't know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it's a pain paying it off
i i don't i don't know um
i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i've p- saved up enough money where i'm going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there
yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars
but um
i don't know i never i never liked loans a lot so i'm not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so
i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things
it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't
don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes
even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know
you got to be they say you have to dress for success [laughter]
yeah
[laughter] how many credit cards do you have
that's pretty good
yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those
it's like but but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it
because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car
yep that's ri- up here at some sto- if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card
well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is
but i don't know um
yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent
yeah thirteen that's not bad
yeah
and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it
i've never had one
oh
[laughter]
that's good [laughter]
yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month
yeah because it's uh
i know especially if your uh
your reimbursement didn't come through [laughter]
from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and
you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way
American Express
yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards
[vocalized-noise] you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa
i bet you th- i bet you there are people that do that
[laughter] you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other
th- i think they charge more for cash advances so
well it yeah you can't get cash advances
oh
oh well no uh it [laughter] i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh even- eventually
no it doesn't
[laughter] be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back
i know i don't
credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying
like unfair advertising or something
[laughter]
oh wow
so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something
that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we al- and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders
yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around
because it is a four percent that they take
three or four percent
i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank
i used to take it off the deposit
[vocalized-noise] you do have to take it off your deposit
yeah so it is a a service that they're offering
i i know should own stock
there instead of these uh
uh banks going that are folding but
i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars
yeah
that's uh probably true
i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan
and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards
[laughter]
that's personal [vocalized-noise]
maybe they don't
yeah
i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had t- confiscate her credit cards [vocalized-noise]
i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing [vocalized-noise] are the spending ones
but i haven't heard o- uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man [laughter]
well i don't know um i i definitely want to get mi- up mine paid off month to month like i used to
and just as soon as i get it paid off i'll probably get laid off [laughter]
terrible can't afford my credit card anymore
[noise]
oh [laughter] who doesn't have credit cards
yeah
yeah
oh i know it's it's Christmas is the worst time f- i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible
oh yeah uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
oh that's good that's really good
oh i know i know
no
oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards
and they've just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them
it's it it's just unreal
i guess
oh yeah
oh of course
[laughter]
yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time
you know uh ge- please ge- ge- ge- and you're already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff
you know they just try to uh to to get you to ge- uh have their credit card and um you know uh si- half a dozen isn't enough [laughter]
oh i have one we well we ha- we have one one Master Card
and
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
yes you do uh-huh yes you do yes you do and tha- tha-
uh down here uh you have to have a cre- uh you just can't live without it
because down here they don't take a check unless you got credit card and driver's license identification
yeah uh it's it's just a another form of identification you know just to
oh yes oh yeah they can
yeah
uh they're all well ours is ours is through our our credit union and it's thirteen so it's
that's not that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really ex- high
it's it's uh
yeah
is it i i don't know we do- uh we don't
my husband has one for t- for uh for business
it's a company card
but he's never had to use it so we don't get any get anything uh for it
i mean we w- we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but but so far he's never had to use it so we don't know anything about the billing
do they uh uh ooh [laughter]
that could get you in awful lot of trouble [laughter]
yeah
yeah
i do- i don't know i think it's uh just a lot of companies prefer American
yeah i i don't know if it's easy for them to get or or or what but um
uh but i guess it's it's run so much different from the other ones
hum
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
oh i i i'm sure there are i mean uh
you take
oh gee oh gee oh
do they um it's it's some cards y- you can do that and some cards you can't down here
i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take
plus
oh so on on uh on some cards
uh-huh well i saying through my bank [vocalized-noise] they they since they have their own card they don't like to give advances through other for other cards
[vocalized-noise]
that that doesn't solve anything
that just [laughter]
yeah [vocalized-noise]
because it's still there [laughter]
it's just some place else now
oh yeah store credit cards
store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa
because i i had a i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while
and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent
so i i cu- i cut that thing up [laughter]
uh-huh
oh really
ooh
yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends
uh i didn't know
wow
oh how awful
[laughter]
yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist
[laughter]
[laughter]
well but everybody's really trying to you know it's become a real national problem credit card debt
and and i we've really cut
oh
it it is it is it th- uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt
and what they're talking about is credit cards
yeah
uh-huh
i don't know if they count uh
mortgages as personal debt
i don't i'm not sure that they do i think uh
what they're talking about like [vocalized-noise] is uh credit cards and other junk [vocalized-noise] and loan car loans things like that
because uh
boy i know people who ki- people right out of college the credit card people like to get you
because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real trouble
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic
well we don't do much eating out
uh
[laughter]
[noise] Benny's
[laughter]
yeah well uh ours usually consists of McDonald's
i've got two young kids and they love McDonald's
yeah well uh i know [vocalized-noise]
it put on some weight for us so we stayed away them or tried to but i love to take the kids they say uh what do you look for to bring them uh to look at to uh come back to
i was talking to my husband while i was listening to they was trying to find a call and uh
i said it's the toy uh uh the play yard out in the front yard you know that McDonald's has
four and two
yeah the- they'd rather go out there and play in the yard than eat
yeah well we've took a we was living out in Memphis and we used to drive back and forth to Louisville that's where we usually from Louisville Kentucky and uh you know we'd stop at the fast foods there uh
usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them too
yeah
yeah they got a couple all you can eat down here and uh we haven't went to them yet but i've been threatening my husband that we'll go
no we've only well we've been in Texas for two years li- a little under two years
so uh
not really i don't know it too well
yes
oh my son does he he's the four year old i've got a Nintendo that he plays with
yeah
yeah well he likes those crane games you know where you try to win a toy
he likes every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy
i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i haven't seen one here
in a game room and toy room yeah
yeah Show Biz Pizza
that's what it is Show Biz yeah uh
yeah it's alright uh i haven't seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there
uh and it was great Stev- the only thing that Steven didn't like that's my son was uh you know they had those dancing bears and stuff it scared him to death
yeah i think that's what it was but uh he he'd rather go and ride on the rides you know they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff and
well we went one time uh one of my ex-boyfriends had taken me this was years and years ago and uh i'd taken my younger brother he's about twelve years younger than i am and uh
i remember eating their pizza and they had put anchovies and all this on it i mean they piled it up
and it was the nastiest tasting pizza i've ever tasted
me i rather go to Mast- Mister Gatti's or there's a Godfather's down in uh Memphis and that was a good pizza i've never tasted a better pizza
uh no the last expensive place i went to it was a it was a [noise] Shoney's huh and we went there every Tuesday night and or Saturday night when we was playing uh when i was playing softball with uh
a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh that's the most expensive place we went to
yeah well it's kind of hard to take two kids uh to a nice place [noise] number one they bug all the other people and uh or so we think they do and
[laughter]
yeah but uh i don't know i every time i set up a baby sitter to uh go out and do something my husband uh nixes it and says we'll stay home this day
and
yeah well i can't i'll you know i say i can't wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i'm going to miss this age when they're gone
uh but i- i do want my freedom back i'm sure my husband does too
not really anything really important in his life
yeah i- i can- you know i can't relate to that just yet
uh you know i mean my daughter she doesn't know the word yes it's no every time you turn around you you know and my son i- i can't describe him it's i don't know why or you know
uh can't relate to a seventeen year old yet
uh you sound like you got a Louisiana accent
Alabama okay alright alright i guess
[vocalized-noise] close to the Louisiana border
okay [vocalized-noise]
yeah
military
yeah m- my husband was in the Navy
what were you in
Air Force uh i he tried to get in there
they wouldn't take him [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah well uh i- i was born in sixty five so i can't say that uh husband was only five years old then too [laughter]
yeah well uh
yeah well i know uh i don't ju- just out of curiosity how do you feel about these guys getting a welcome home that you all didn't get
oh well we wonder how these topics get chosen where was the last place you went out to eat
well last place we went was uh
uh oh we went to uh Popeye's uh Fried Chicken well actually [vocalized-noise] it was a drive through
well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well
yeah
[laughter]
well how old are your kids
oh so they really like that sort of stuff then
i can remember many times that when wh- it's interesting though that that you know particularly when you're traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonald's that's that's a big playground
uh when th- ki- you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while
yeah that that that's really nice that they started doing that because it's the problem is you take them to some place nice and
and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry
and uh yeah you know we now that we're a little older we can go to i- i still like um i like buffets
yeah well have you been in the area very long
oh
you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um
hum
last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut
and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so they're they get the business but
with a crowd of people it's uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i'm trying to think it's right off anyway i don't know if it's Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one an- and uh
they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games
oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh
yeah
[laughter] well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to
well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there there's a couple of those that they combined and it's a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of
and yeah and an- they have the the room full of balls and
yeah yeah Show Biz that's the name of it
well do you like the pizza at Show Biz
oh
yeah yeah
well you know they're so large they animated it
yeah that's really uh
yeah we were until the kids got older we'd go there and you know it was um
that right i'll date myself a little bit but it it's remarkable the number of those things they need
i guess i think Show Biz and and Chucky Cheese and all those i think they merged or something but it still it's still quite popular i have to i'm not sure the pizza was okay i mean
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
well
[vocalized-noise]
well
well do you ever go out to any of the higher higher end type more expensive places
hum
um
well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area uh Spring Creek Barbecue that's right in Richardson and it uh i- i like the barbecue there
um and it it's fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food
yeah it is
they're probably just being normal though
well when the you know it's funny when th- [laughter] when the when the kids get a lot older though you can you can you can do as you please our son
graduates this year and we're kind of looking forward to
yeah yeah they're
well the you know it's it's kind of like wanting to talk you know and um but and then they learned to say no and
it's kind of funny but they
uh th- th- and now they get older our son's a senior in high school will talk to us but he you know you know you know it's mostly
um no it
no no no and it's sort of i guess it's a little disappointing but but i suppose it's it's just the way life is but
right
[laughter] well it it you know everybody all says ah you'd be surprised how quickly it comes but it it uh we moved here in seventy six and daughter was six weeks old and
hard to believe in nearly fifteen years
no i- i- i grew up in uh in Alabama
[noise] well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama
but i've i've been away from there for
goodness i haven't lived in Alabama
since nineteen sixty five that's been a
a long time ago i lived several places Europe and
in Asia yeah i spent
but so i was in the Air Force
[laughter] yeah uh i was i was i went in in nineteen and sixty five when they were drafting people in fact my father was on the draft board so
[laughter]
yeah well it things are different when uh everybody in in fact that it that was Vietnam era i was in fact i went to Vietnam myself
it was it's it's a different world
well see i never had a hard time coming home it didn't uh you know there all these people that that would spit on them and all these kinds of things i- i- i came home and got married and i- i never uh
i and cou- now but i didn't and i mentioned that to my wife and she said well you never wore your uniform when you were off duty but i didn't uh i flew into Los Angeles
um but i had um when i was in Vietnam
but i by then when we landed actually went into Seattle Tacoma and i changed out of my uniform [vocalized-noise] civilian clothes and
and i never [vocalized-noise] course i stayed in i stayed in the Air Force a number of years but i never had any problems
um and all this th- all the of course i wasn't in combat either um i was a staff weenie
all right
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
how fine
[laughter]
um
oh boy
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh really
[laughter]
hm
wow
[laughter]
hum
well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so
we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and
but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that um there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard
so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me
that when i grew up in Missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically
so
yes we are we we tried we planted some fescue last um fall
and it- it's really really pretty and um [noise] and green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter
and uh
and it's pretty goo- it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know
it's supposed to die off like in August and then you re- replant it in September
and uh
so but we don't the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard
and um
so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or or even gardens that
we're just saying let's get some grass
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know
uh-huh
oh yeah
oh no
[laughter]
on its own
uh-huh
uh-huh
hum
[laughter]
yes and
it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri i mean it just happened
and um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people
um um we live in north of Dallas and um
Plano
uh-huh up north and um
and so there's a lot of uh market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for
for yards yard work
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind
and so that really cuts into your backyard space and
but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just
right now we're just this is we just moved in in September so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the
the necessity [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um
[laughter]
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh
grass
oh
um
or what it was
well we're going to have to do that because um we have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and um
the trees are just so tall and there must be what ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that
like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet
[laughter]
well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but um
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
[laughter]
too hot yes
well there are all different kinds there
you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees
there are some big
big tall oak trees one across
[noise]
okay well um we lived i grew up in San Antonio and uh i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldn't grow [laughter]
down there and uh
we had a small um farm house out in Castroville which is just uh to the west of San Antonio
and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil uh nice
because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate
and when we came up here uh to California uh we're in the Monterrey area and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow
so we've been out here um well really in in the house since December and we've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio uh
because the heat would just dry them up after you know about uh three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started
and here they uh are supposed to last year around and so we have some really pretty flowers growing and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of uh pine mulch
uh just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here uh just around us you know
we got here at the end of about a four year drought
uh we've had a whole lot of rain uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month
so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is uh
when i first came here it everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer
but uh that has been uh the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and
uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend
but um we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh uh-huh
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass is that what you're
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh okay does that last through the summer too
um
oh
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
just get grass to grow i know
uh-huh
well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and
trying to keep grass alive during a summer on uh a piece of ground that big was expensive [laughter]
and to water it and uh eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in February
um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard
and uh so when we left you know the back yard had
and the Saint um i think it was Saint Augustine that we had um i- it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back
yeah we were just re- you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that you know if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again
but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a a large lawn alive
that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out
so
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] Arlington area
okay Plano uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular
especially in um the Dallas area you know there's there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
right i know oh it's it's awful the first house well th- our house in Castroville was the first one too
and uh we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening [laughter] would run into
and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water
and uh the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground uh irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in
that was
that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all
and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh
so i hope you can find uh i don't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio
um they had a gardener
and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's um i think it's just called Texas Gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use uh for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas
and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the the book
it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like Texas Gardening
and it talks about um you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about uh the grass and there there being [vocalized-noise] the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used
but i don't remem- i don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what but i do remember they had used a blend
uh-huh
oh
but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
it makes the biggest difference
when you have the big old trees
and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new little trees They didn't have any shade [laughter] they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day
so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there
oh that's even better
oh
uh-huh
i r- i really don't know enough about the Middle East to form solid opinions but i don't uh how about you do you have a solid opinions on on US involvement
uh-huh
totally different world
hm
so you're saying that the coalition forces should've got went ahead and uh gone in and taken out uh Iraq instead of just recapturing Kuwait
yeah and well bad thing is i mean you can't do that because the the Saudis asked you know the Saudis were were helping you know out
on only under the condition that they would help that the United States and the coalition force would help Kuwait regain their country
and other- otherwise otherwise
right
and plus you know it's illegal you know in uh
in uh warfare or any t- or any other kind of uh international
to go against the to exactly you can't go after the the leader you can't legally do that i mean then again you know there's people who say war is war everything's fair
but that's just not it's it's like some you know a Geneva convention or something like that said it
uh-huh
yeah
but
yeah it's it's but it's it's it's it's very hard to deal with people that don't bel- don't believe in the same things and don't live the same way that you do you know it's like as we think that
Saddam Hussein ruined the country and that
that that Iraq would be much better with a democracy so that the people could decide what they want
but then again you got you have all the Palestinians that that think that this Saddam Hussein is is a you know is a God is i- is someone that's going to relieve them of all their troubles and how can you get across to people that
think that you know their savior you're telling them that their savior
is a person of empty promises you can't you know it's hard it's hard to do that so it's hard to change a diff- a country especially in the Middle East which has different views on life
getting him out yeah
uh-huh
i think i think the United States should uh stick around and play a role but i don't think that United States should uh get directly involved from now on they should kind of stay stay on the outside of uh
of the events you know kind of
i don't know how to say i- how to say it exactly in words but you know just kind of stay with one eye looking in the situation make sure that
United States can go in when need be you know it's not like uh uh tha- we'll be ready if they ever ask for help
uh-huh
uh-huh
so there's already some trouble brewing huh
yeah
yeah
you mean after the cease fire
well i think
yeah the well i think uh they they also shot down some gunships is that what you're talking about the the uh helicopter gun ships that that they shot down
because uh what i heard was that the that the the military was was uh shooting down civilians and and um anti Hussein
troops with gun ships
it's a mess it's hard it's hard for two different societies to get together and and try to help each other mutually when they don't agree on so many things
and then you know and then and especially with the Middle East the way it is they the too -sane you know these these the Arabs are fighting amongst themselves and then one Arab decides to ask
a non Arab for help and that just kind of turns everybody else against them like you know that's why the Palestinians were were rooting for or were pulling for Hussein because they're all Arabs
and they really didn't like the idea of the United States coming in and helping out Kuwait who was so rich
yeah
yeah
oh well
yeah i think we did the right thing
right
well i think it deterred i think it deterred Hussein from doing anything else because if w- if for example we we let Hussein go in there and take Kuwait then
it could have been just like uh you know World War Two be- it may you know because Hitler got little bit of what he wanted here he'd try it again and got some more he'd try again and got some more
right
right
yeah yeah
yeah because they don't have anything to lose so they'll go ahead and use them
um-hum
but they have less to lose if they use them you know it's like they're they're third world countries they you know they they're like their their people are in bad shape well we'll go ahead and use it and
put some other country in our shape see that's the way they think
so
yeah
it'll be interesting to see how it turns out now you know who who does what if Hussein actually stays in power or not
yeah
yeah
we'll see all right well hey it was nice talking to you
yeah you too bye
[noise]
well i i think it's been interesting to hear you know about the overall outlook you know before we ended the war what implications we'd be dealing with uh you know the
strong religious beliefs and uh you know it's just another
uh attitude you know and what we are really getting into and and the fact that that that war you know coalition forces stuck together uh and uh
you know i just think now is that they shou- they should have finished Saddam off because i think
we're just going to see re- repercu- repercussions down the line because he's he'll probably maintained power it sounds like he's uh you know uh knocked down the revolt you know so
or at least got Saddam
you know if they you know if they
yeah no i i don't think i don't i don't think a lot of them didn't want him to lose con- you know power completely but it's hard to say um
yeah to go a- to go after the political heads of state but
yeah
yeah but
anyway but now it looks like uh you know Kuwait has asked us to defend its borders more of a permanent type of basis which will be a first
uh
so it's interesting uh uh
yeah
yeah
yeah i don't know if the in- yeah United States is interested as much as establishing a democracy
as opposed to just getting rid of Saddam you know it just uh
but you know we'll see if if anything if he
if he gets stability uh and he doesn't you know get knocked off you know by a coup or something down the line you know what happens you know down the road i just uh it'll be interesting
yeah [noise]
yeah
um-hum
yeah well it's interesting
yeah interesting there's like a two square m- mile area that's occupied by some Iraqi soldiers and Kuwait's saying it's their land
and they have the their line of demarcation is that what they call it uh
and they've already outlined that for the cease fire and uh apparently we don't want to deal with that but the Kuwaitis want this la- want these th- th- this land back that they're saying it's theirs
so tha- that was kind of interesting that we said that we said no we're not going to get involved you know we've already established you know the line of cease fire do you you know and the uh demarcation line so
um they were definitely trying to avoid any hostilities i thought it was interesting though that we did kn- uh shoot down some of their airplanes when they went up but i don't think they're doing that anymore
yeah yeah well well well they warned them th- we t- we told them we would this is after that c- the cease fire so
i don't know maybe they were helicopters i thought they were airpl- i thought they were letting the helicopters fly around a- a-
yeah
anyway so it's uh
yep
yeah
uh well they hate i mean they hate us over there most those people uh
but obviously i think it was
in- influ- you know the heads of state obviously you know
you know the ones that uh let us in but uh
it- i- it's that's anyway i would think uh
yeah i think it was good that w-
th- that we got that you know that
you know we drew the line somewhere
and uh whether that uh
you know what effect it has in the long run y- you know to be all right
um-hum and i and i think
yeah i the think you know it'll deter the next person from
you know uh thinking the same types of things but i think the problem is that we'll never get away from
the expansion idea i mean you know we're terr- we're territory in general we're going to run into another you know uh
i don't want to go so far and say it's a Hitler but crap Saddam seems like he's as bad as Hitler almost by the way you know they torture and kill people y- you know from what you read but uh
you know once the nuclear power y- you know nuclear uh
you know bombs uh get in the hands of some of these other countries uh for them to you know who knows uh
who may try what down the road
yeah that's another thing is that they you know they just they don't understand implications i don't think or or may or may not but um
yeah well we'll see and you know it has i mo- i may fairly young here i got to
they keep saying they think [noise] he won't make it but it looks like he's you know taking control of all these cities that were uh besieged by the rebels but sounds like he's gotten control and
you know it's just a matter if if he can survive you know without somebody else you know a coup attempt or something
um
all righty and uh take her easy all righty bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
where do you get most of your news
where where are you oh yeah
no i'm in San Antonio
um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool uh-huh and uh
and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news
um-hum
oh [laughter] yeah
um-hum
yeah um one of the women that i work with her husband is Iranian
so here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch
um-hum
[noise]
um-hum
well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize
i understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town
yeah
[laughter]
i've been getting a kick out of those lately
although um
i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh
military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i
i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were the- they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me
um-hum
um-hum
you know one of the the best uh television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on ABC and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh
on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very
informative and interesting [vocalized-noise] and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh
translating the war for children
um-hum
and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos
that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war
uh it was it was
right it was something for children
that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing
well
back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh
the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly
covered by the news
yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television
and i had
yeah
i tell you what the the uh war start- let's see was it a Wednesday or Thursday must have been Thursday
um and Friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open
because i was watching CNN and they would they would switch back to the one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed
oh
um-hum
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
no there are two and they're pretty close
uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it- it's
piddley stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has The Far Side and some other comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so
[vocalized-noise]
yeah
and my fi-
my fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers He takes both San Antonio papers an Austin paper both Houston papers i guess he takes seven the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper
but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections
and so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread unless
[noise]
i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends
i'm in Dallas
are you in Dallas also
oh really okay
um-hum
oh really
um-hum
i normally find that uh i- i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch
i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week
but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the MacNeil Lehrer news hour is on uh public television and i enjoy that quite a bit
um-hum
i will admit i work with uh someone who's Iranian
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also
but he's i don't know uh he's
mu- much much more so it's it's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um
he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country
um-hum
true um the
they um tend to spend
quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that ABC's Nightline
uh well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories
no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um
with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because um i saw plenty of jokes and and um
oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living during the the Gulf War
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i will admit it's interesting i i i'm twenty six so i don't have any more experience in that than you um
it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events
to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah i i didn't see anything like that although i did uh i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but
there there is a a big push you kn- with the local [vocalized-noise] T V stations to have little hot lines with um counselors
to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing
um-hum
i- it with the children's aspect um-hum
um-hum
i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was
a a new concern with people
um-hum
that's true that's true
and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't flauge too badly
i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was
horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing
um-hum
um-hum
i i didn't have that experience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to PBS which i thought i thought they did a very good job
um i've got one question for you i
you say you take the newspaper
um
i i found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting we've got
the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the Times Herald and then the Morning News which has a very strong subscription
does San Antonio ha- you said San Antonio right
[vocalized-noise] do you have just one paper or do you have several
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends i figure i'm only taking on the weekend and i can afford that i i find the news reporting in the the
Mourning News to be better but i i sort of have a liberal political slant and the Mourning News just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook
still i i get the Times Herald just to balance that out a little bit
um-hum
well what kind of pets do you have
are yo- you're married
and newly married
oh
[laughter]
sounds like us
only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids that's why i thought when you were saying you know we're going to have one in two months or something
perhaps that you were newly married [laughter]
hm
yeah
yes
that's easier
are you going to get a dog
that's what that's what we have is two dogs
big dogs
well our first [vocalized-noise] both they were our child substitutes before we had our children
and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt
and he's been it was alright before we had our kids it was he's just he's a real hyper dog he barks and and jumps a lot
so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for his entire life to have a Siberian husky
and i think why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog [laughter]
[laughter]
you know this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky
so we got the other one
for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day
so we have the the old the older dog's a male and he's
he weighs about forty pounds and then Pepper is a year younger and she weighs
about seventy pounds
so we have two massive dogs
go through lots of dog food
absolutely
i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because he'd grown up with them but i can't stand it indoors
i don't they shed and you know the mud and
oh yeah
there for me dogs are meant to be outside [laughter]
goodness
oh my goodness
sure
[laughter]
they're going to run you down
[laughter]
goodness and all of them were in the house
hm
i see
yeah
hm
okay
oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty
they weigh about ten pounds
and so we had we had one for a long time
and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female [laughter]
[laughter] and then we started having puppies and she had
she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little
and the rest of the time they were outside they had a big we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off
so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out
but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last
her next to last litter we kept we had one the one we never could get rid of
he was a real dumb dog nobody wanted him the puppy was just one of these dogs just as dumb as a stick
and we have him
and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again
turned out she wasn't
and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like
four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it
two days after the they were born she had a she died
she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old
we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby
and fee- and bottle feed them
and we just
oh
um
weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive
so you could still feed it but she kept them clean
oh she didn't she didn't do something
um
oh no
yuck
oh goodness
[laughter]
what's a mess
that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too
we were giving them a bath about every other d- boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible
because they would roll and everything and oh
yeah
and crawl through it [vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank
and i had a few until
well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um
this was a box and it was originally it was it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end
and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water [laughter]
[laughter]
we outgrew the need for that
and so i used it for an aquarium [laughter]
[laughter]
it worked except the fish could swim
it wasn't tall enough i kept the if i didn't keep the the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes [laughter]
[laughter]
flip out of the thing but
yeah
those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half
so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard
because the kids were gettin- i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard
because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little
you know they just even walking by him they'd kn- they'd knock him down and the whole the whole back yard had poop in it all the time
it was a mess for the little one so
now we have a back yard and a dog run
oh that'll be nice
yeah back and forth uh
three and a half
yeah
or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much
yeah
because that's hard ours our kids have gotten
over it with the dogs behind it they have the the run it's kind of like a wire run
so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke
my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you know
and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into
but boy the little one still just wants to poke and
and see if the dog will back off you know and
yeah [laughter]
yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little
i think when they're really little like the the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal
because the kids are so miserable to them [laughter]
if they're out very much
yeah
that's
yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that
i i always felt Pepper the the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and
they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldn't even she'd kind of look at them [laughter] like what are you doing now
she's real good natured about it
yeah
well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so
[laughter]
okay well it's been nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
[noise]
at the present time we have none we intend to uh purchase a pup in two months
yes
no we've got uh we've been married forever about eight years [laughter] eight years two kids that was just
[laughter]
no we've uh
my we we've we've got a five year old but we've had one pet since we've had her but uh he didn't quite work out
so um
we are we've been now petless for a couple of years and
we're going to get another one this summer we're we've a got a vacation planned and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we
bring a puppy in
yeah yeah
what type
[laughter]
uh-huh
goodness
right
yeah they're big dogs
yeah Are they primarily outdoor dogs
yeah
and the scratches and the smell and the uh wherever yeah
i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had Danes when i was a child and um
and we had our Danes in the house
but i mean it's almost dangerous [laughter] to have them in the house
and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes
we had
yeah and we had we had had a litter
and she had uh had thirteen puppies
eight of which survived and uh
and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies
we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous
we wound up getting um get getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
right
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh
yeah
we had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their bab- feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived
yeah
yeah she did survive
no
no she didn't even she did not even take the sa- this is the laziest dog that ever lived
when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mother's stomach in the middle of the bed
had the puppies and woke up my mother
to cut the sacks off she didn't even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like sh- they didn't exist
[laughter] yeah
yeah
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they
yeah
like a nice aquarium
oh yeah
yeah
[noise]
that's great
the cat was always happy
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh we've uh we'll probably get real small Cairn terrier
and it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog
but see my my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the uh
responsibilities a three and a half year old really can't quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them
oh she's she's got respect for animals thank goodness
uh-huh
yeah
i think that's eighteen months
i mean i think that's just kids trying to figure out you know what's going to happen and it will happen again and again and again
[laughter]
yeah
yeah yeah it has to be a real uh mellow kind of animal that can
uh
survive it and child
[laughter] yeah
well that's what you i mean that's what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too
but
we uh
oh wonderful
[laughter] i'm just flat out of pet stories i don't even have a pet anymore
well thanks [vocalized-noise] thanks for calling bye-bye
[noise]
okay [laughter] um i guess um
this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess
but um
um well i've made a lot of baby gifts [laughter] it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies [laughter] that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings
um
isn't that funny no [laughter]
[noise]
[laughter]
yeah [laughter] isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing um a friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i- i needlepointed the the face
and i uh kept that because she gave me that so [laughter]
oh yeah and it's real neat
um [noise] basically the the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts
and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so
oh what's that
huh
wow well that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do
uh-huh
oh
yeah
[laughter]
tha- what did you call that
huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it
yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess
but um i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting
um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows
really [laughter]
[noise] that's
yeah it is
[laughter]
oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons
they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know
yeah
i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but
um
oh definitely yeah [laughter]
oh
oh
yeah
that's i think that's what my concern was you know wasn't really sure and how they would how they would last
[laughter] you're right no that's true though that's funny
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
oh i know [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] that's funny [laughter] no i just um
i don't i have really have gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to
um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time
now and i have two children also so that it keeps me very busy [laughter] but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it's really
it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down [laughter] i just
uh-huh uh-huh
i know i started a project
it's been over a year ago [laughter] that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for Christmas and i
[laughter] that's what i keep telling this person well i didn't tell you what year [laughter]
[noise] [vocalized-noise]
um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work
and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but
not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard
uh-huh uh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work [laughter] yep
uh-huh
uh-huh
yep
no it really isn't and i tell you really [noise] i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life [laughter]
[laughter]
no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard
but i really do en- like i said i really enjoy it when i do [laughter] it's just hard
uh-huh and there's there's so many other things that i
i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs
and wall hangings
and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up
and do them
no
no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those
and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's
a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters
if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah
yeah
there's yeah there's a a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many [laughter] real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh
uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny
it was really easy i mean just
just did a thumb print you know
uh-huh
and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it ju- it didn't take anything at all and
uh-huh
um-hum
and then i just
[laughter]
oh really what kinds of things have you done
aha [laughter]
do you ever keep any of your stuff
[laughter] i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and and it it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work
oh well can you go to so and so's house
yes
ooh
that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers uh and and like minute
marks
oh
i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the Bargello
well it's an Italian um
needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the
uh hum the
what what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used wi- uh with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth
and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or
whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to
uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them
what i did when when i was doing that was mostly pillows [laughter] you know for sofas and so forth and
i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves
or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished
but i have no idea where they are
bargello it's B A R G E double L O
i suspect you i suspect you have
me too yeah [laughter] that's interesting
how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh
uh what how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas- how were you decorating the baskets
um
like fabric that's been stiffened in yes
i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six
and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
when i do um crochet it's it's usually the the lacy Victorian type
things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then
um allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh
uh high humidity
in in a room
do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing [laughter] i'm terrible
[laughter] so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh
uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be
out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors [laughter] uh and i hate to dust so that's the first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean [laughter]
oh you don't have time
you definitely don't have time
that
i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all
you just didn't say which Christmas right [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
what was this project
now this is this is done in the needlepoint hm
yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my to- my total attention
and so i've got to have
total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish
[laughter]
oh
i'm sure you'll get it done but it just maybe not on the original obviously not on the original time schedule
just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that
do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that
okay
um
that's what i would do too
or or whatever i have that's
ooh
what
with ink or oh okay
oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just
just like being finger printed
[noise]
have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently
uh-huh
so you're saying that the repairs would have cost more than the car was worth
[laughter]
i think any car that runs right now is in demand
uh i work on my own i've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that i've had uh since it was new
and i've had very good luck with it uh haven't had many repairs done at all the alternator went out four years ago and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three
but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really haven't had anything but uh regular maintenance
yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication
but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that
and i had to have an alignment done last year so i had that done
uh not really it's not too easy
i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so
and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done [laughter]
namely uh re- putting the catalytic converter back on the car
and fixing the emergency brake
so those things i could do myself it wasn't a problem
Texas
uh-huh
i had that problem with a nineteen sixty eight Camaro
i never did get it fixed
it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot
yeah
hm
yeah
right they never do
uh-huh
i've heard of that problem with many other different cars doesn't seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer
i won't buy a Dodge
my dad had one he had a Dodge
six hundred and after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out
nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a Ford Escort
[laughter]
oh a lot of people do like Fords yeah
sure
yep
i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to le- huh
uh-huh
i guess that's what about thirty forty thousand dollars
right
[laughter] i guess not [laughter]
i have no idea i know they're they're engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
no dealers will g- get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it
they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the oil
and it's it's it's a bunch of hog wash i- i've changed the oil myself i've put a filter on you know put the oil in and all it's no problem at all
no i have to get under my car to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it four times a year it's not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for two dollars uh the oil um less than a d- d- less than a dollar a dollar a quart it's really not that
uh-huh
right
well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i can't crawl under it the clearance isn't enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off it's not a problem
yeah
uh-huh for anything else i'll put the car up on jack stands
oh yeah
when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands
but it wasn't a real problem
yeah every three thousand miles i'll change the oil i've got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now
and uh its working just fine i don't have any problems at all so i'm going to keep it uh i get offers [laughter] every now and then from
from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend
the trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less
yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted
a new car
oh i'm no- i don't think i'm in the new car market [laughter]
a new car that really hard pick
[noise]
well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car [laughter] because of the requirement to do some major repairs
um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um
i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced
and um
but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely
right and um
um
i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um
which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed
i guess so um bu- i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it
and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars
wow
[laughter]
yeah
but do you do anything yourself i mean
yeah
okay
right
yeah yeah
i don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself is it [laughter] unless you had the equipment
yeah
[laughter]
oh [laughter]
yeah
yeah what now what state are you in
Texas you're in Texas so am i
um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up
and then i run t- run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it won't start
and it won't start until the car is cooled off
i've learned that
and as soon as it coo- cools off it'll start right up
what was the problem
oh [laughter]
yeah
yeah somebody said that um
that uh there mus- there's probably some kind of short in the starter
and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short
and then i- i- it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short
but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the garage
but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't re- recur
they couldn't get it to fail
and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didn't have the problem
but now it's starting to recur again
so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was will- he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem
uh yeah and i'm going we- we- i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure
and then uh
yeah
well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a Dodge before
and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it
and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all
you won't [laughter] oh yeah
yeah
oh really Holy mackerel
oh jeez
[laughter] i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the world but
yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time
and uh
uh so i- i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but
yeah
yeah
[laughter] i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass
and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and fin- the thing finally went
so he goes out and he buys a Lexus
and i'm going whoa [laughter] he he moved up [laughter]
yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old
he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on [laughter]
so but uh i can- i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars
really
well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know five minute change places
and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um
you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars
and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter
and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going
i don't think that's worth it [laughter] i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i don't know
yeah oh yeah
[laughter] oh jeez
what
yeah
yeah yeah
i couldn't i tried to do that with my Escort but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car
ooh
yeah yeah
oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous
i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it
hum
yeah i just couldn't yeah
yeah
i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think
at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can s- i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it it's right there
you've got jacks it makes me nervous
[laughter]
whoa whoa
yeah yeah hm
well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle
i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it
yeah
wow wow
gee
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
all right [laughter]
right right
well i bet you i bet i mean if it's in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price
well
the pa- paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at
yeah
[laughter]
well what what what brand i mean what model would you look
[noise]
okay um let's see how do you feel about credit cards [laughter]
uh-huh
right
right
yeah
right
wow
wow
well we uh me and my wife when
when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have and we can put it in our budget
yeah we'll we'll use it but like last year i think we paid um i think it was like twenty something cents interest
on our Visa
and i think this this year we
uh i think we used it for Christmas and we got caught just a few days on our grace period
and uh so we'll pay a little interest this year but maybe two dollars but we don't like to do that at all
and you know we i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly
we uh we have several credit cards though
um we have a gas card our Visa and then of course the American Express
and i think we have a couple of department stores
but we use it the same way and uh
uh-huh
right right
it's it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill that's usually how we do it
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right
yeah
yeah
right
right
well that's good i've
i don't think we've gone that far we've been before [laughter] to pay it in ad- you know in advance before we spend it but
i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it that like that that may be good
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really
yeah
right right
uh-huh
uh-huh
wow
wow
yeah
right
right right
uh-huh
right yeah
right
yeah
right
yeah especially
yeah
yeah well that- that's good
oh from the Dallas area
oh really
wow [vocalized-noise] do you work for TI
well really
um uh i wonder how
TI got GTE involved
oh okay
oh okay
yeah
yeah
yeah you have a very um
very what's the word your your speech is very exact
[vocalized-noise] [laughter]
oh really
wow
yeah
right i i work in uh a wafer fab
yeah
they
yeah [laughter] i think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject so i think you get ten so [laughter]
i think we're okay
w- well you too
same here
bye
[noise]
[laughter]
personally i do not care for them
uh although i find them a necessity in business and so forth i i try to refrain from their use as much as possible
um
for a number of reasons
one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them
the one i use uh of course for mostly only for business purposes is uh you know American Express
and uh
i'm not [noise]
i'm not terribly in favor of them not for my own personal uh point of view
plus it uh has you know from an economic point of view it has increased our
debt
um
tremendously
to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion i believe is number uh at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have i have heard
do you use them frequently or
[laughter]
uh-huh
yes
uh-huh
i find the one i use mostly uh
aside from the American Express i do use
my Sears card
uh
but
uh
i try [vocalized-noise] as with the American Express i try to pay it
you know as it comes in
so uh
i know when i travel or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit what i would do on my American Express card
is
before i would before i left
i would mail a check to to American Express
and
you know have some idea of how much was there you know i'd sent them you know several hundred dollars or whatever
i felt i would spend
and then use it then
but uh you know for hotels and and so forth but uh
but i knew that it was paid i knew [laughter]
i knew that i had that much credit going in sometimes you know sometimes i would go over but uh
it wouldn't you know it wouldn't hit me in a big in a big way because i knew that uh i would have it covered in that respect
[laughter]
uh-huh
well i found you know i found in um
in traveling overseas
that uh
often
it would uh it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card
for uh for hotel bills and so forth
plus i would uh
when they
uh
would send the bill and they would automatically convert
to the
exchange rate
so
now the only t- time that got to be a problem was if the exchange rate changed drastically
uh for example i remember on one trip to France
when i started planning the trip
i think uh
a dollar was worth nine or ten francs
and just in a matter of a week or two
the dollar fell against the franc drastically and whe- when i finally got over there
it had fallen uh two or three francs to the dollar so the
[laughter] so
i got caught a little short in that regard but uh
uh i i was anticipating you know my room would cost uh
let's say if it were
say sixty or seventy francs a night
that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so
or maybe twenty doll- maybe it would be more than that it was more than [vocalized-noise]
it would average out to thirty five or forty dollars a night which is a reasonable rate
but then [laughter]
when i got back and i was working for the government at the time
uh of course the government was several months behind on their per on its per diem for exchange rate
so there's a little consternation you know in trying to uh get them to compensate for the uh for the difference in the exchange rate
[laughter]
that that was the only time i really got caught short and i
but as i said most most of all i try not to use them uh to any you know lavishly in that regard
and it yeah yeah
well from where are you calling
so you're from Dall- okay i'm from Maryland
yeah [laughter]
no i work for GTE
yes
well i know Jack Godfrey
i know him very well i've known Jack for a long time and i'm also in the speech business
so when i heard that Jack was going to do this i called him and asked for an application where i could participate
in this and uh
so that's how i got involved
oh thank you very much [laughter] but uh
as Jack said i'm one of the uh
the old hands in the speech business i- i've i've uh yes i i've been doing it for twenty some odd years
and so uh uh i was very much interested in uh getting involved in uh switchboard
so
uh you work for TI
oh really oh
i guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording [laughter]
okay
right
well all right
okay fine well you have a good evening
it's been pleasant talking to you
take care
good night
[noise]
uh-huh
a Mark seven
uh what do the Mark sevens usually run
thirty five K
well there's a tremendous amount of money alright
i see
i agree about that uh American cars should be
the ones to be bought [noise] um i just wish their quality would to still improve further
oh
yes it's a matter of time it's probably going to be another
two to five years before they're really up to par where they should be and then i believe the majority of American people will
yeah
they will already have in fact i have one myself i'm
[noise] reluctant to admit [noise]
she does
Honda Accord yes that's one
what year model is it
eighty nine
well that's fairly new m- mine is an eighty four Sentra
and the only problem i've ever experienced major type problem i've experienced is a
a fuel pump [noise] had to be replaced and it's got eighty four thousand no it's got eighty nine thousand miles on it now
you do
no major malfunctions then
i see well that's good to hear
in Consumer Digest or a Consumer Reports
a Taurus
uh-huh
well that's not too bad in price listing
it has an eight
cylinder
oh yeah
correct
Lee Iacocca stressed on the mini van uh i mean the mini van has been one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler isn't it
um
their durability is a lot better i understand than most other vans
right
there's a lot of uh duplicity in the vehicles the way the build them too
insofar as their design um uh American even foreign
but i'm sure it's all for streamlining or for air streamlining
right
uh yeah just a second
going to pick them up
excuse me for a moment
right i'm fixing to get them right now
excuse me i had to uh
talk to my boss
okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there's no uh interruptions here to tell us that we're done or
okay later
[noise]
okay the car if i buy a car it'd probably be an American made car
[laughter] that's what's with me wrong because i feel of the economy i would probably buy an American made car even though sometimes the foreign cars are better but we're losing a lot of money
[laughter] buying foreign cars and people getting out of jobs as it is
so i'd probably buy i've always own American car
uh the kind of car is probably something i couldn't afford
[laughter] like a Lincoln i would love to have a Lincoln
[noise]
mark seven
yes
oh about thirty five
to forty
uh-huh
it's a luxury car it's a it's a sports luxury car
it's right below the Continental the Lincoln Continental
you know it's it's along that line
um-hum
yeah they're getting even better i think
yeah
already have foreign cars
uh-huh
i don't my mother has one
yes she finally she wa- she had a she's got a a Honda um not a Honda a Toyota that what is it Accord no Honda Accord yeah
and she hasn't had any problems out of it see
oh think it's a eighty nine
uh-huh
uh-huh
see i have a i have a Lincoln Continental right now
it's a yeah it's a seventy nine Lincoln it's got over a hundred thousand miles
and there is no problem with the car see the i think
huh-uh huh-uh my air conditioner went out but i mean [noise] ten years [laughter]
but uh i mean as far as major there's nothing major with the car
but
it i think what it is the American public had made good cars at one time and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff
the first car i think now that they have that's uh that's [vocalized-noise] made it on the what do you call it the mechanic's list or the the why they check the how they judge cars what is it list where they come out with the consumer list
yeah is a is a is a Taurus
yeah that's the first one that's made it
and uh its a you know it's a four door it's a nice car now for me to buy a Taurus i would have to buy top of the line Taurus and that's Taurus Show
it's it's it's it has a four speed i like that stick shift [laughter]
but see that's top of the line that costs twenty whereas a Taurus would cost about
a regular Taurus i think is twelve or thirteen
huh-uh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that
it has the well yeah i think it has the it has that engine like the Mustang
yeah and it's a four it's i think it's you know the speed uh uh manual transmission
so
but yes i would definitely buy one of those before if i had to between that and Lincoln i'd probably buy the Show
yeah
i don't know
[noise]
i thin- it woul- it's not so much of the vans any more or the cars some of them are ugly
i'm sorry [laughter] they look like space mobiles [laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
why you can't still go fast so what's the difference that's what i don't understand
you know they're making it so that they're talking about the wind current and how how efficient it is but if you can't go fast you can't go fast i don't care how sleek they make it
it just makes sense to me It's like they're making a
a model of a speed car when you can't go fast
you know the in in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that autobahn
[laughter]
but over here nobody should be going that fast to be worried about wind
[laughter]
no
i know how that go
[noise] but
i guess that's about it
and i better let you go
uh-huh that's it just hang up all righty bye
[noise] come here
[noise]
[noise]
uh we are latecomers my husband and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so we've not been at the game that long but we love it
uh probably
i am a player but certainly not a good player uh the highlight of my season is probably the four times i get under a hundred
so
oh i see
gosh i thought young people were all good
[laughter]
uh-huh so you find yours- you find yourself in the rough a lot
oh
well we we speak of the three games of golf here
and that would be the long the short and the putt of it
so [laughter]
uh-huh we uh often times have made a trip to Mississippi in March because of course it's still cold here in March and we always hope for warm weather down there and the people that
we play with uh the men foursome are all much longer ball hitters than my husband is
but he finds that by going straight down the middle he usually wins about a quarter a hole because they've been in the rough on the right and then in the rough on the left
so he ends up playing just as well as they do [laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
yes our golf course in this small town is a beautiful course with a creek running through it so we have some water hazards and we have some sand and we have some hills um
for the most part we all use carts uh battery operated carts and and uh most of us own our own carts
my husband happens to be on the board for the first time this year which is a new experience for him uh our membership is very inexpensive um
probably total cost with monthly minimum and cart storage and membership would make it about a thousand dollars a year
oh can you really that amazes me
uh-huh
i'm always amazed that uh larger areas uh they can play for what we can
uh many of our friends who are transferred away from [vocalized-noise] for some reason or another end up in cities that it would cost them ten thousand dollars a year to belong to a club
which
right
so do you play much
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum um-hum and you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more time
oh i see
oh my [laughter]
well we're down to two cats and they don't take a whole lot of time either but we find that each fall when the season seems to be shut down here we say next year we're going to play more golf
uh this is the second summer that my husband's been retired and he did play more last year of course but we were gone a lot too uh
and that makes although we've played golf a lot of places around the United States uh on different trips but it's even though we started late it's certainly become a very prime part of our life in the summer time
never have in fact we just drove through Texas uh in mid February or late February i guess and we hoped to play while we were there we stayed overnight in a little town called Eastland Texas
and wanted to play hoped to play there the next morning but it was like thirty nine degrees the next morning and very windy so we just went on to El Paso
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh that would be wonderful to be able to play and of course from our town a lot of people go to Arizona or Florida for the winter and they're able to play all year round but
um-hum
yes i was amazed we spent [vocalized-noise] the only time we played on our trip was in Douglas Arizona and uh that was just
it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in another month when they started watering
so yes it's it's it's become a big part of our lives even though we're late players
well i guess not
well maybe you'll get to play more this year
uh we- plan on it at least
nice chatting with you
bye
[noise]
you uh
oh well good so you're a player then instead of a spectator then
oh right
boy you're you're you're right up there about where i am then [laughter]
[noise]
on no young people like to swing real hard at the ball
[laughter]
they like to hit it a long way
well i'm i'm getting better about hitting them straight but uh where i get into trouble is around the green
my my short game leaves a lot to be desired
[laughter]
oh
yes
the short of it is my weakest part
yeah i i've you know i've i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the street from a golf course here in Texas
and uh most of the older folks that go out there and play are exactly the same way all of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball you know a mile
but it's like three fairways over [laughter]
uh-huh
oh boy
yeah
well you can get a walking membership for two hundred dollars a year at the course down here [laughter] yeah
yeah it's an eighteen hole course i mean it's it's uh not terribly difficult and there's really there's a a river that runs along the side but it only comes into play on one par three hole and
there's really not that many hazards on it but uh it's it's a really inexpensive course to get on
[laughter]
yeah there's a few of those here too
no not near as much as i'd like to i mean i've i tend to stay pretty busy at my job and uh
i- it's hard to get on a regular schedule and then we're also pretty active in our church which takes up a lot more time too so
bu-
no we actually don't
we have we have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
where have you have you played any in Texas
yeah it does basically though the the golf season only shuts down for maybe three months out of the year if that much you know probably not even that much because really
uh February and January were about the only two really cold months that we had [vocalized-noise] it was it was up in the very warm temperatures even in December this year
[noise]
sure
yeah oh Arizona's beautiful
um
yeah
hey well hey you know it's never too late is what i say
well i sure hope so
okay
and with you
bye-bye
[noise]
there so we're discussing U- US involvement in the Middle East that's a tough one now isn't it
but should we be the world police
i you know i- i that's my question to myself i don't know would that be smart on our part
well but we've done it before [noise] and it has not been successful
and those poor souls aren't going to get in to anything but food lines at this point
[vocalized-noise] it's
and use the UN as it was set up to be
our people now
well they had an interview with uh
i'm going to mispronounce his name i know uh Schmor- i can't pronounce his name i give up the general Nor- Stormin' Norman
[laughter] and um
at the end of it
uh i it must have been Sixty Minutes or something like that i really for- no David Frost that's what it was anyway at the end of it they rolled all of the U- US names of the US casualties
and there were two women there
so it's it's not our men anymore it's it's our people
my husband thought both of them were the Quonset hut
uh he thought so
well
well i mean i think it's horrible what they did to the Kurds and i think gassing a whole village of women and children and all this s- sort of thing that's even before this latest event
it's horr- it's horrible and i think what he's doing to them is horrible what did he do he did some atrocity the other day he dropped something on them um
chemical- it wasn't chemicals what was it
it was it was dread- i can't even remember what it was now it was something melted but it was just dreadful you know and i i'm i'm i'm horrified but i don't think everytime there's an atrocity committed in the world we should run over there
and monitor it we can't afford to
and we're not smart enough to know who's right and wrong either
maybe the you know there's no telling what the Kurds did at some point in time
you know we just we're not smart enough to be objective with all these situations and say okay these are the ones this is the side we should be on
and we have so many internal problems
that are not you know they they are growing we are twenty fourth in the world for
malnourish oh no infant
infant mortality that's what it is
and i mean the countries ahead of are ahead of us that this babies live longer and are more healthy are rather embarrassing i mean there are some countries in there that we have no business being behind
our technology is there
and i- i th- i thi-
and i think we're breeding another disease this that's
i th- i think we're
i think that we have a s- a social disease called poverty i think people get into the syndrome of poverty
and they don't know how to get back out again
they're they're following what their parents did and their parents did
but the money they get is just i mean it's borderline survival i couldn't live on two hundred and thirty dollars a month i can't go to the grocery store twice for that kind of money
i can't with my family and i have a small family
so you know i granted they can do that very easily it's easy to do but look where it puts them
it puts them in a trap
and hopefully things are more merciful where you are but we actually had some ho- uh street people picked up last week in Dallas for picking up tin cans
picking up tin cans they were going to turn them in you know they were going to cash them in
uh disturbing the trash or something like tha-
i just blew my mind i thought wait a minute [laughter]
well Dall- Dallas politics are rather strange y- you know for anyone they're stran- down here they're strange i can imagine from an outsider's point of view
oh we are too
ri- i think we should promise to solve all of our problems and then we can work on somebody else's
well they may have come into their own because for so many years they were just a a lame duck organization that really didn't have anything and maybe they have at last achieved the status or the need for a
organization such as that that they will achieve the status they should have had all along
well the other way is to say no and to refer it to the U- and just say i'm sorry you know we're not yes yes it's sad you're losing people but why should we lose people because you you know
well that's not the answer though the answer is yes you're losing people and we're sorry but we're not the people to to make these decisions
a a world council
well now that we've solved the problems of the world that was easy [laughter]
well i think people agree i think it's just getting it implemented
uh it's that's a very costly thing and it's turning lose of power
well it is it is but uh i- i- in a way and in a way it isn't uh our involvement is kind of over i hope [laughter] although um from the news i as i get it they're trying to get us back involved again beca-
well i [laughter]
yeah
well [vocalized-noise]
uh what we've d- what we did in the war i
was behind completely but getting into their countries' uh civil wars no i don't think that that we should have to take that responsibility um i think that they should be totally
uh able to handle it themselves i mean if we went and policed just like you say every country when they had squabbles uh
oh i know we have
well that's true and we've done it before because of i think more that that we are afraid Russia was going to get in on it and it's going to be a battle for you know but uh no i
boy that's for sure i it's hard to realize that that there are are places that are just so uh
bare on the shelves as as there i i saw that on the news last night too but uh but no i i think that our involvement in the Middle East should be
i think that now instead of coming to the US for help in their civil wars and things they should go to the UN and if they need help it should be handled through the UN and not through the Uni- uh not the United States
that's correct uh too many times we get our fingers in the pie and uh the UN isn't even brought into it and uh
uh i hate seeing our boys [laughter] put on the line [laughter] so to speak uh yeah and uh u- u- us paying for it [laughter] oh
yes oh i know who you mean oh yeah i know who you mean [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yes
yeah oh yeah well that's true uh there one woman was killed in that when they hit that Quonset hut and uh i do- i'm not sure where the other one was but but it's true
oh they were oh okay i i wasn't sure where the second one was but uh but yeah well that's true uh
there a- there were several women uh involved uh directly uh in this war where they weren't before but but i think uh that
i th- really think we should let the UN take care of things instead of uh us being responsible because you know you hear all this about government spending and about the budget and [vocalized-noise] and all this other and uh
then we go off chasing these you know what to giving people the tanks and equipment and uh
jus-
right
right
um
right
yes i agree
no like i said that should be the uh job of the UN not uh the United States [laughter] uh
right that's right well besides uh
they
[noise] they what they c- the countries need is guidance and h- how to handle their civil wars and their uh their disturbances their [vocalized-noise] border you know us
uh struggles uh they don't need somebody else coming in and saying you know okay we're going to be with them and we're going you know zap it to you uh they need to learn how to handle this themselves that we could go on and on forever
helping them you know th- these other countries try to handle their disputes uh
i know [laughter] i i'd like to see them
um-hum
um-hum yeah
um-hum
yes right
i know it's just that uh uh the people just do without you know the poor people kind of get in fact all of the
cutting of [laughter] you know back of the budget and everything now that there's plenty of money to go and help these countries out and give them all this equipment and everything but there's not enough money to feed
you know people uh i- in a lot of areas in the United States and they're cutting back on programs for the handicapped and programs for the uh aged and you know things like this that uh
um-hum
uh yeah
right well that and t- and we make it so easy for them to stay there with welfare that they can get by just signing some papers and you know not having to work for it or anything i mean you know if people are used to working for uh
oh i know i know
yep i know
that's right not anymore so uh
um-hum yeah
well that's right
yep it does it's just like a catch twenty two yeah and uh some of them y- you know are not trained so they can't they haven't l-
learned they couldn't make as much money out on their own so uh and then jobs are harder to get too people cutting back while the government cutting back a lot of uh uh
contracts and the stuff like that uh so it's just kind of a snowball effect you know uh
my gracious [laughter]
uh-huh and they pi- they picked him up what for
my gosh [laughter] uh dear well in in our area right now
yes i guess so
[laughter] yeah that is a little uh uh going a little bit too far
um yeah
[laughter]
[laughter] yeah well um we've uh the county that i live in now has gotten into recycling so we recycle everything and um
so there really isn't much for them to [laughter] to get but uh but that is kind of sad i- when when the focus is more on o- the other countries than our own so i mean some of the social problems and the uh poverty problems and things and
right right or like to say too just have the UN take care of it i it should be it should be their
baby not ours uh we shouldn't have to get into it at all unle- but except for the peo- our people that are on the UN as you know advisors uh then you know i think that would be appropriate but uh
for us just to
right
right
right
well i hope that uh they will start picking up on some of these things and and getting involved because uh that's the only way that we're going to get out of it
and uh that's [vocalized-noise]
well yes i know
um-hum
right well that's it
right but you should go to uh somebody that can be you know that is not representative of one country
yes right right
i don't know
[laughter]
yeah well i wish we could get somebody to listen though [laughter]
[laughter] you know you know
yes
yes yes that uh i think is one of the biggies uh uh
[noise]
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
what kind of pet did you have as [vocalized-noise] what kind of pets did you have as children
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well i have um i have a cat that i've had for about eight or nine years
and i wouldn't trade her for anything [laughter] i also have a child
cat's lot easier to take care of than the chi- you can go away and leave her for a few days
yeah i've left her well i've left her alone up to about four days
because she doesn't she's real good she doesn't overeat or anything
and so i can leave food out and know that you know she only eats when she's hungry i know some people have cats that no matter how much you put down they'll eat it all
and then if i'm
if i'm gone longer than that then i'll have somebody come in and um you know make sure that she has food and and fresh water usually i just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen
and i've even she drinks out of the toilet
uh-huh
uh well you have to kee- uh if you don't keep them clean my friend had gerbils and you could smell it as soon as you walked into their to her house
yeah
yeah
yeah can you hold did they let you hold them or
uh-huh
was it are they young do you know how old they are
uh-huh
uh-huh
how old how old are your kids
okay mine's five [vocalized-noise]
yeah
they do or my cat does to me like she doesn't like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into hiding
[laughter] but um
i i had a dog for a while before i had my son and i grew up we grew up having dogs and i'd like to have a dog but
kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so
you know i can't leave a dog like i can leave a cat
and plus they require a lot in the way of training and
which now that i'm home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but
you know i just don't you know there i don't know why but with dogs it seems you have to have a lot more vet bills [noise]
plus they're more expensive to get
now my cat i've had her for eight or nine years
i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but
then she has not been sick one day i have never had her to the vet other than just her you know her maintenance stuff
and it seems like whenever i've had a dog you know something always you know they're always getting sick or you know breaking a leg or [laughter]
something
and i just i don't need that expense right now plus they eat more and
yeah that yeah i don't know if that's such a big problem here in Dallas
um my cat stays inside because she's declawed so i don't really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a dog you know they need exercise and you have to walk them
[laughter]
not really pets just kind of things [laughter]
yeah
yeah yeah
[vocalized-noise] they make you feel special you know i live alone with my five year old and my cat and i mean she really does she makes me feel like she cares about me and
you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day
and um [noise]
i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish
but until i get in a place where i feel like that's where i'm going to be for [laughter] a long time they're just their so hard to move
yeah
yeah and now i have some friends who have aquariums and i enjoy
watching the fish and looking in at them you know but that's something that you really i feel that you need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn
what fish are compatible you know and what ones you can put together and what ones you can't you know how to feed them and how to you know to clean them you know the thought of cleaning an aquarium is not very [laughter] pleasing but
with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean they're almost maintenance free
uh-huh
yeah
well that's good
oh
well that's good yeah that's not bad
i had two i managed i guess when i was in high school or junior high i managed to talk my parents into letting me have a gerbil
i won't tell you what happened to it [laughter] if you just got them you don't [laughter]
poor thing i- part of it was my fault i guess i just didn't take care of it like i should have [vocalized-noise]
do they like to watch him
uh-huh
how many did you get did you get two are they male or female does that make a difference
uh-huh
but you don't really know
[laughter] [vocalized-noise] and there's about six more in the cage
[laughter]
oh no
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise] i've heard that it
that after they have babies that you have to separate the then you have to separate the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies
yeah
[laughter]
oh no
that's funny
okay well it was nice talking to you
and good luck [laughter]
yeah i- i- i know my cat she's reaching her life expectancy and i'm already thinking oh no
[noise]
well i've kind of resisted having any pets because well i had some pets as a child
but uh you know now that i have two kids they're sort of like pets
you have to take care of them a lot and they require a lot of time and um neatness and plus you know now that i'm married i have
a husband that i do some things that you know help him
and so it seems like i have plenty things to do and so i thought that if we got a pet that that would just be one more person
well the kids you know the kids wanted
[noise]
the kids love all kinds of pets you know cats and dogs and things and i know some kinds of pets are more
[noise]
independent and as a child i had um you know like a we had a dog and we had turtles and
we had um
you know small lot of the small things like i know we got [vocalized-noise] a little bunny at Easter once and
a little baby chicken and all that but they say you shouldn't do that any more but um
uh-huh
oh yeah
uh-huh
yes
they can take care of themselves especially cats are pretty good about being independent
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
well we just last week we got a gerbil that's a thing that i picked for the kids because they were wanting to have a pet and i i didn't want to have one i picked gerbils because
they apparently they aren't like you know they don't smell as bad as other
yeah oh that's awful and i i don't like that odor and um
and they they don't require as much but we'll see how it works out it wasn't as
it's not something that um i had to like learn to
something that's going to be running around your house that if you're unaccustomed to that you wouldn't like such a big change and
they stay in their little cage and [vocalized-noise] you throw a few things in there they're not loving you know like a ca-
well we're just getting used to them right now we're kind of just letting you know touching them
and we've picked them up before but that was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now
well they they
seem like you know they were smaller compared to some of the other ones
but we
we i did that i
let the kids have a pet because
i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish
they're four and five
and i thought it would be good for them to just practice you know having someone else to care for and
everything i know that a lot of pets a lot of people have pets
because they make good companions and
friends and
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
expensive to maintain and
keep the flea powder and the flea dip and [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm
i'm not really ready to have a pet too much [laughter] i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at
yeah they are not
because they don't really acknowledge that they know you you know it's not like a pet pe- a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing
but
uh-huh
that's true
um
a long time
yes and they they take up a lot of you know good space like kind of like a bookcase
uh-huh huh
no
yes and i noticed um that's kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom
and you can just um you know rinse that out it's kind off to the side it unscrews and
and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out
and you don't [vocalized-noise] supposedly you don't have to change all of the the bedding and everything except every three weeks which is not very often
uh-huh
oh no
[laughter] it's something awful [laughter] oh
um
well i'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the kids and a little bit of a
they do and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it but i
these just aren't going to be as tame as the book i got a book first
[noise] they just don't seem like um well i guess we've have them about a week now and they're just not kind of
two
well we hope that we got two females so that they're supposed to get along better
and um and they won't have any babies
i guess we won't know unless they never have any babies [laughter]
[laughter]
well but you know the people that sold them go well it's hard to tell but we think and we're going oh great
so if they have babies then we'll have to get rid of one of them
yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something
so within a month i guess or two we'll know
well i guess i better run go
yes nice
well thanks and it was nice to hear that you've had such good luck with your cat
[noise]
i'm great [laughter]
yeah
no i don't have one at home i work [vocalized-noise] on at work continually you know but i do not have one of my own at home
what do you have at home
uh-huh
right
from the the oldies but the goodies it's probably pretty close to what i have because i have the the same kind of thing at work i have a three eighty six S X which is TI computer but everything in is in IBM mode so
do you use it a lot at home what do you
uh uh-huh
so you're on it a lot
uh-huh
uh-huh
i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just
you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little PC it was great you know
that's wonderful i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat i just don't know if we would really use it that much you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for Christmas and
and [vocalized-noise] you know it's got some stuff on it it's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff and i don't think she's ever touched it
you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know so
yeah just as quickly
now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that hi- his checkbook is on on on on on a disk and he goes in and prin- and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and
and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places and you know
and he just whips out you know i saw him yesterday morning over there and
and he paid his monthly bills and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks and he just you know they're perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and
he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know so
that's exactly right he said you know he said used to be i said i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn't any you know it does it for you so
this you know there are some definitely some some advantages to it it's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business so
right
yeah yeah
as he grows up he'll be even more and more too
that'll be great
uh-huh
really
well yeah i
i'm going through right now i'm you know going part time in the evenings and you know i do yeah everything has to be typed i mean they require it you have to type it you know and
and so i'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little P- on the PC up here you know typing stuff so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were if you were going to school
well you i don't know i can't no no and that's they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i
i don't know what they used to do [laughter] before they
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh and you had to type all of his papers
oh gosh
oh cut your time in half at least
at least
yeah
uh-huh you
you do the whole thing over
that's right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and r- right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably another year
and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything but it's amazing you know then when where you know someone would have you type a letter
they did it right they did it right i mean they [vocalized-noise] they yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over
well we'll try this out and see what it looks like yeah yeah so
yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where
you know we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many cha- how many of them do i make changes on
and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn't read it or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever
and you know she's also keeping a percentage you know [vocalized-noise] what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason and there's like one week she she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed
you know and it's like you know it's ridiculous and [vocalized-noise] and that was that was the high week but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types you know that's
well that's exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing the w- you know at this time to now
you know i mean that that's the kind of things that you know p- that she's keeping and showing you know that th- this this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so
anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way but i don't know there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative
you know without a doubt without a doubt
well i would like to get one at home some day we've got a two year old son and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in so- sources from outside would be wonderful you know so
oh i do too i do too the the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know th- that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be nice to kind of fun to be to be able to play with it
so i know my father had a PC and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other peo- talk to people all over the country you know
and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in [vocalized-noise] hi how are you [vocalized-noise] and they'd type back [vocalized-noise] everything everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said
prints out on your screen as they're typing it and it was just great fun you know
it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limi- limited to like twenty minutes a day you know so [laughter]
it's oh it added up big well you know we [vocalized-noise] my parents were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know
but when you're doing the guilty father complex you know because he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of you can kind of get all kinds of stuff you know
that's sad well it was nice to talk to you
have a nice you too
bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
[noise]
hi how are you today
good well as a matter of fact i'm before we started this conversation i was working on my PC at home
uh do you have one
yeah
do you have
we have an um actually it's a TI computer but it is the IBM
um clone it's not the TI PC from back when
right
uh-huh
right [noise]
right
[noise] yeah that's what we have um
well i really do i um am an accountant and but i work at home
so i use it for that quite often um
we have you know used some of it for some personal things we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it um
i since it's tax season i'm doing a lot of taxes so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well
uh-huh
oh it is
yeah you can that's right
i
we really we deci- we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home
then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things but it for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it
so
uh-huh
really
right she could just as easily do those things by hand
yeah
uh-huh
oh my gosh [laughter]
huh
right
right
and you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make
[noise]
right
that's true
right
i- i think in most cases i'd have to say no not unless somebody really enjoys it or
perhaps is using it for education i have a four year old son and we have some education programs that he likes a little Sesame Street one and um we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one
that's right
yeah and [vocalized-noise] i think about it i guess for for kids like as they get older especially now
uh when they get to junior high school high school and even college i mean my sister went to college um started about three years ago and she had to have a a computer
i mean it was like a necessity she couldn't imagine going through college without a computer
uh-huh
right
sure
yeah any more i don't even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter [laughter]
probably not even no
uh-huh
well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together and then he went on and got his Master's degree while i was working
and i'm the better typist of us and uh we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then it wasn't that long ago but
i typed his Master's papers and things on a typewriter oh boy to have a computer back then
[vocalized-noise] at least i mean and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over you take out a sentence
on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine take out a sentence on a piece of paper [laughter] that you typed
that's right [laughter]
uh-huh
oh yeah
the first time yeah
that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because people do feel like oh well we can just change it if you need to
right
use it as a just a
right
i know
oh yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
i believe it
uh-huh
well it's good that she does that i mean bring it to people's attention
[laughter]
right
oh i have to
[laughter]
right
especially when they're in school i think they would get a lot out of it
uh-huh oh yeah
uh-huh
right
[laughter]
right
ooh [laughter]
uh-huh
ooh that still could add up [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
oh
well
yeah you too
have a nice day
bye-bye
[noise]
uh-huh
no no kids
was that the animated version
even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation
yeah
yeah that was made in a few i don't know several years back i guess
latest latest one i've saw which was a
mistake to go see was Lionheart had Claude Van Damme
he was he's of course uh i guess he's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but
the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to
yeah chop them up exactly and
yeah
or he's singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super
superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more
and all of them i guess could be in that fashion
or category
it was about uh
a French Foreign Legion fellow
who deserts to go help his brother's wife
who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs
[laughter]
and he got killed
so he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money
and then he moves on to L A to where that where she is
to just help him out
it was really i mean the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something i don't know
[laughter]
well it was worth the buck i guess
a lot of
uh-huh
yeah
i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting uh
i guess what made it so good was the cinema- cinematography
yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good
um i thought an excellent one too was misery
with Kathy Bates and James Caan i'm not a James Caan fan but
that was a well directed and acted movie
i'd recommend it It's a little on the violent side
but then what movie isn't anymore
well i have no objections to it It's just uh and it's a matter of your taste uh
yeah
and even on those type they don't show what you expect
[laughter]
right
yeah that seems to be the norm of most movies but
what the hey this is America
yeah yes i have that was pretty good
i always wait for the movie i don't have time to read the book
uh-huh
yeah
they did me to
that's the magic of Hollywood special effects i hear this movie F X part two coming out is uh pretty good
did you ever see the original one
it was uh you ought to rent the uh F X part one It doesn't say part one but it it's F slash X
a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um
oh
i'm not sure i can't remember It's been a while since i've seen it But he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings
with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done
and uh
right and using makeup and using the
all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go
but you need to rent the first one first
uh if if that is that the second one follows the first i don't know if they have the uh
original actors on that first one to that one
oh i expected those i mean Hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think
uh-huh
actual names will not be used
[laughter]
eventually i'm sure they will come out with the the the proper names
latest story
uh-huh
Kevin Costner i understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf supposedly
i don't know that's just one of the many rumors that floats around
or what you read
pretty much used up the tape i guess
same and uh we'll
[laughter]
talk to you on the next go around
adios
[noise]
okay
movies i've i haven't seen too many lately
i have kids and we went and saw
The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or
yeah it's a Wa- Walt Disney movie
[noise]
and it didn't get as you know as good a reviews
as like the Little Mermaid the last one and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things
last year
but this one was i thought was excellent the i can't both
yeah it's animated and i can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now
it's just just the special effects you know and in this movie this there's this boy and he rescues this uh bald eagle
and uh and it's a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that and the boy actually rides on his back
and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know they're flying all over with it
and i mean i know there they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day but it was just
so real realistic and lifelike and good animation
what a good show
well Roger was a composite one there's one there's a movie i've seen Roger Rabbit that's not a recent movie
but uh i enjoyed that show
yeah yeah
uh-huh
chop them up huh
[laughter]
this is supposed to be the the guy that's uh replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or
or the next Chuck Norris
type guy
uh-huh
superstar
uh-huh
um-hum
hum uh-huh
uh-huh
keeps trying
[laughter]
really uplifting huh [laughter]
um-hum
yeah i haven't heard i hadn't heard much about that movie i other than it was a chop them up movie
but uh
well i guess that's one i won't go see
[laughter]
oh you went to the dollar movie yeah
yeah they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out you know they're usually not
not that great or didn't do that great anyway
let me see let me see another movie i watched uh i want to see is uh that new one uh
that won all those Academy Awards this year Dances With Wolves i haven't seen that have you seen that one yet
what what what
the the wide open you know spaces
um-hum
is that right
uh-huh
right right yeah our movies today it used to be X and
you know and PGs used to be Rs and
seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit
yeah yeah oh yeah it's just that yeah it's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having X now they have what NC seventeen
they just changed it because X had a connotation with it you know
so
right a lot of those are really violent type movies
really gory
um
um
let me see
let me see one movie i saw i guess it was a while back Red October have you seen that one
yeah i read the book before so i knew the story line going in but
they changed some things in the movie wasn't the same i thought the book was better
than the movie but i thought the movie was really good as well
yeah i don't i read about one or two thick novels like that a year
you know that's about all the time i can
i can spare but that was a good show i thought you know
i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine you know that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and
all the Hollywood magic it all those underwater scenes
i thought you know it looked to me like it was a real submarine
that was in the water you know
yeah
is that right
i didn't
huh what's that about
hm
to to fool people and and things huh
all the tricks
uh-huh that sounds like an interesting concept
to understand what's going on the second
uh-huh
they're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies
this summer too [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah well they had some in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and and you know and
and Americans and they decide oh make it Iraqis and Americans you know and they just change the title and
uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could i guess they figured we wouldn't can't tell the difference between an
yeah right
[laughter]
yeah
right it was such a it i guess they they'll probably come out with a lot of
movies you know it was it was such a rout though you know i don't know
you know they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or
or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured
[laughter]
is that right
[laughter]
yeah
um-hum
well i think we've probably
yeah yeah it's been about five minutes
it's been nice talking with you
keep on watching those movies huh [laughter]
okay bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
first of all i'm gonna to tell you i- i have two little kids but they're not in public school yet i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten
yeah
no but uh being one of these late in life mothers i've listened to everybody else's you know complaints as to wha- what what's the matter with either their kids or the school system so i've been surprised do are do you have school age kids
oh
such as
um-hum they
[laughter]
well i heard a a frightening thing a- actually i didn't hear it it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher
in the public school systems in the state of Texas and i think it's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage
of uh people to teach math and sciences and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach
at seventy five dollars a day and there's always going to be you know uh somebody having a need for a math or science teacher i thought Christ they're letting me in to you know this would be this would be frightening i don't know anything about it
right
right and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids
i tell you what i'm finding frightening and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment
i'm on i'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school
and i used to think well that's wonderful you know they can get a real life experience
what i'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from i- in in different preschools it's like day and night and i wonder how do they handle
a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak English let alone know her colors
and they're in the same classrooms and i guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids
starting kindergarten my God i think it'd be next year is what i'd read
i thought h- well how do you how do you weed those out
and i was listening to NPR the National Public Radio and they've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes
they said at the bottom of the SAT scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education
yes
yes and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry
the people that t- took you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable and it my God you know
uh are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know wh- where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids i don't know
well y- you know you you sit here and you think about that at the same time you think
God i just hope i don't sound like a stage mother because i- right now if you ask my friends tw- put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands you know up there
oh no nobody has nobody has a non gifted child
and i keep thinking you know uh gifted is is Einstein or you know uh musical prodigies it's it's not a kid who's you know precocious
you know what has you know ha- has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted
i don't know
oh don't say that
um-hum
um-hum
well you see i think that that just harks right back to the elementary and junior high years because i have a stepson now who's twenty five and uh i was just absolutely shocked
uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork uh i remember being you know taught and i think you know i- you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process
and
you know they can get a th- they can grasp the points can they convey the data verbally or in writing and that's what's you know really scary to me um
i would really you know there's such a a p- push a- among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought
and at an early age and if they can't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you you start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking
teach them these basic skills
well [vocalized-noise] my stepson you know i
he went into the Navy or Air Force i just really get my military i married into a military family and i don't know i re- address them all as generals so i don't offend anybody
but uh you know fortunately for him he wasn't dumb but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper
and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him and they said that he's you know great in electronics but he you know he's really does need the basic skills and they put him through six months
of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors
this is the kid who who really y- you know barely made it through high school
and i keep thinking you know it's not it's really not too late at any point to do you know some
yes
but yes and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations
but i think that for this kid it's going to be you know his lifesaver otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity
so i don't know you know it does make me nervous
[laughter] there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on
or send them to private schools and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know
maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework or
the other part of me says is God i've had enough kids [laughter] do i real-
[noise]
okay well
ah yeah
so you haven't really uh dealt with that in a sense
[laughter]
yeah yeah
uh mine are both out of school and uh
you know i i've
in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh
you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over
what's happening up there you know type thing um well
just over the years there were situations that um uh came up that i didn't think were fair or handled correctly or the teachers didn't seem to be
teaching anything of course it's a little hard to tell from
the the information that you get from your child you know they they bring things home and i was never one to believe everything my kids said you know about something
but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job and yet others i know are just wonderful
hum
yeah
that's pretty interesting because just
just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it
oh yeah in fact i think that's that's one of the big problems today is
the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
yes some of those certainly have a lot of dis- difficulties you know with uh
all sorts of things and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases
oh wow [laughter]
that's encouraging [laughter]
yeah well that's you know that's an idea maybe there need to be some radical changes made do some things that are
totally different and unheard of
[laughter]
oh you're kidding
[laughter]
yeah
hum that's interesting i don't know mine didn't did not fall into the gifted category [laughter]
[noise]
nope and i would never have said so either uh
but uh they managed to get through although not always
with flying colors uh
in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had um he was struggling with senior English and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the English instructor and
uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in and she told me what she had requested
and i read it and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth i thought it had some nice well thought out
uh parts to it she gave him an F on that paper and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject and you give them an F
on something that doesn't seem that bad to me what are you telling that student
you're telling them that w- hey you might as well forget it you know
um-hum
yeah uh it's pretty sad to think uh about those who e- e- even today are graduating from school and they are telling that they don't know how to read you know
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
oh
yeah
that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it you would have expected them to be the last ones to
yeah
well i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along there's a whole lot of stuff going on out there
yeah
[laughter]
[noise]
do you have pets
three cats
i see
oh really that's interesting what breed do you do you deal in
i see
oh my
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
sure
yeah yeah i've never never done pets you know as a for breeding purposes i've just you know usually always had a pet of some kind around we're at currently we have
two cats i've got a big old seventeen pound black male alley cat and i've got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the Humane Society she's the cutest little thing then i have a twelve year old Dachshund that's gosh she's one of the family absolutely
yeah
yeah she's twelve years old she pretty well you know sets the ground rules for the household
lo- that's right lo- the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel
cats of course don't care too much to travel
um-hum
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
that's amazing
yeah we've never had a cat of course like i said i guess the only time i've ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier
maybe maybe if we didn't put them in carriers maybe they would enjoy it more i don't know
probably so probably so
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum could be yeah could be yeah that our little tabby cat is the only cat that i've ever seen or had
that she absolutely hates to be picked up she would rather just do anything than be picked up more normally y- you know you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway she just absolutely hates it i don't know if it's
yes she does that but she yeah um-hum when she wants to of course
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
that's right yeah she does that that's true that's true
um-hum
yes
um-hum just tense yeah absolutely
yeah we've had our our two cats uh declawed because we keep them in the house all the time
well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot uh security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in
but our black cat has never never once been outside and has no interest in going outside you can actually leave the door open he'll come to the door and sit down but he never goes outside
um-hum they love to watch the birds um
um-hum um-hum
um-hum oh yeah they enjoy that
um-hum that's right just hypnotized yeah
yeah yeah
yeah our little cat just wants wants out maybe once a day that's about all
hum hum
um-hum
yeah my wife's a cat person until we married i'd never really
oh we'd had a cat occasionally you know and left it outside most of the time we lived in kind of a rural area my wife's a real cat person one time not when we were together but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats
yeah boy i try to keep her away from the Humane Society she always want to bring something home you know yeah
um-hum
yeah
that's what she does yeah that's right
yes it really is
um-hum
um-hum
get a kitten yeah um-hum
that's right
um-hum
that's right or move off and leave them
um-hum
oh gosh
um-hum
yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something
yeah um-hum
could be could be
um-hum no not if they've never been out in any weather i wouldn't think so especially
um-hum
yeah
could be yeah that that's too bad it really is it is
absolutely yeah um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
bloodhound
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum yeah they they are smart they really are right next door or my neighbor across the street has a couple of Labs they're really nice dogs they really are
i see
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
[laughter] yeah yes i've seen that
yes i've had a German Shepherd that did that one time
um-hum
i bet she did
um-hum
um-hum [laughter] that was cheap entertainment wasn't it yeah
it really is our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our our new family is the you know our two cats and our dog we never really
well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so they've really become children they're they're real characters they real- well all of them are
oh yeah they are um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife's uh mother is uh oh about [vocalized-noise] seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she's more happy to see the dog than she is u-
i can't get it can't get her convinced that she really shouldn't try to feed my dog chocolate though she always wants to do a little Hershey Kisses you know you really shouldn't feed chocolate to a dog especially a small dog
so i kind of have to watch her when she's around the dog
yeah
i guess so yeah s- for some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too
they do as a matter of fact they do
um-hum
um-hum yeah they love it they really do
no
oh yeah absolutely
i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food
[laughter]
um-hum
yeah
[laughter] now i think i've experienced my first cat here that will not eat tuna we have a cat that will not eat tuna um-hum
yeah that's strange um-hum
yeah i thought
yeah that's true
um-hum
yeah
that's right that's right yeah i believe this is the first cat that i've ever had that would not even consider eating tuna
oh yeah absolutely and even beef as a matter of fact in small quantities
um-hum oh yeah they love love chicken
um-hum um-hum
that's right [laughter] well Jeff it's been good talking to you
yeah
yeah take care of those cats all right bye-bye
[noise]
yeah i've got uh three cats uh yeah me and my roommate have a little business on the side and we we breed uh cats yeah it's it's
well w- just about anything we get our hands on right now we've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian
and uh yeah they're a lot of fun and we're not in it as a business we just we like cats and we decided well if we're going to have them we might as well get some purebreds and maybe make a little money on the side
[laughter]
yeah
yeah a friend of mine had a Dachshund and it's same way i mean
yeah [laughter] and the cats listen right [laughter] yeah
[laughter]
[laughter]
uh one of mine does the Himalayan Persian the little himmy
if i take her to the vet i used to put her in her in a cage and take her down but now i just carry her out to the car and she crawls up in my uh up on my shoulder
and just watches everything yeah she she enjoys the car
probably i think it's the carrier that scares them now on the other hand the Bombay hates the car she'll uh sh-
uh when i bring that cage out she knows what's going to happen [laughter] it's p- i don't know maybe it's the maybe it's the thought about the vet that worries her [laughter]
um-hum
will will she crawl up in your lap yeah some of them some of them are like that they uh they yeah they they don't want to be held but but whenever they want to sit in your lap they want you to be uh open to that yeah
yeah yeah the little Turkish Vans like that pick her up and boy those claws come out and sticks her arms straight out with the claws extended yeah yeah s- silly cat [laughter]
yeah
um-hum
yeah
yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they're they're
yeah along the si- one side of our house there's nothing but trees and bushes and we've got lots of squirrels and birds and all that around here and they just they'll sit there in that window for hours watching all this
yeah and they'll go to the doors and stand up on the screen door looking out but uh they're not too interested in going outside i
yeah the Bombay uh actually went through one of the screens last week trying to get out uh so i had to go round her up
but uh
yeah they're they're fun
um-hum
um sounds like my next door neighbor
oh that's my problem i'll go down to the uh SPCA or the Humane shelter and i i feel so sorry for them and i just want to i want to bring them all home
it's so pathetic to see them down there
i'm just uh it irritates me the way people
mistreat animals and and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty
and they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can't support it and they take them down there and they end up getting
or move off and leave them and they they end i don't know where this o- th- my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah i'd seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it
it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or i- we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves
yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off
i- it's sad i mean and they do it to dogs
the last dog i got i think was that way because he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a home or couldn't find his way home and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh
the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a Lab head
uh and definitely part Gray- uh bloodhound because he had these h- big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a Lab
and he was the smartest dog i've ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying
um-hum
well my my brother raise- my brother raises Labs and he gave one to uh he gave one to me several years ago
and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my my redwood furniture
[laughter] uh she chewed the corners off the picnic table and chewed cross members off chairs
yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it
she'd grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and she'd drag that thing around the yard [laughter] she was a sight to behold
it was it's so easy to entertain them [noise]
yeah
yeah well they're enjoyable to to have around i i uh i run a little business out of the house here and uh i'm usually alone
and got all these cats around so they they keep me occupied well they
[laughter]
[laughter]
no [laughter]
no th- th- [laughter] get get her a get her a box of doggy biscuits to to to let her feed him
[laughter]
well of course Da- and Dachshunds like chocolate i i rem- i remember that other one too he was always after somebody's chocolate bar
my my cats don't think much of chocolate course they're s- they're so damn finicky anyway
it's
yeah well they do well i- i- we found out that didn't work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you've got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this
i've g- i've i've got one that won't doesn't even like anything with fish in it
yeah a- actually you know fish is not their natural food that's that's the
peo- i don't know why i guess the cartoons and everything people grow up believing cats like fish the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it's moving it's s- something to play with
i bet it likes chicken though
yeah every one of mi- yeah yeah even mine love chicken when i get in when i yeah when i get in there to fry chicken or something they're all standing around waiting because they know they're going to get a piece
i j- i usually yeah okay well it's been fun you have a good day
yeah thanks a lot bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
all right
[laughter] i have some do you [laughter]
yes me too
well i have uh
we've got an American Express which we got that on purpose so we could pay that off every month that way we we know our limit
but then i also have department stores and um
you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isn't too bad it's just your normal
you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile
exactly
uh-huh
right
yeah
right
just your Visa yeah
yeah i you know uh people always complain about American Express saying not enough people take it but i've i've rarely found a place that wouldn't that wouldn't take it so that doesn't bother me luckily
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh does it
sure
that's true that's true that's that's real nice to
that's true
uh-huh
paid back i know
when we first got married we you know went and got all the credit cards and
of course charged those puppies up and it's oh boy when those bills start coming in
they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there
uh-huh uh-huh
that's good
uh-huh
that's good
i've noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments
you know it's like whoa [laughter]
wait a minute
don't pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up
so that's what i normally try to do if it's pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time
and get it down quicker
but they're easy to use
no have you
uh-huh
i don't understand how they do that
right
but they say you can't be turned down and i don't understand how they can
uh-huh
oh
i see
sure they've got your money already
well gosh
well that's darn easy then [laughter]
i wouldn't turn you down either i'll give you one [laughter]
huh no i haven't attempted that i'm satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that
uh-huh
right
ri- that's true that's true
well we uh
my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash
or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then it's nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that it's it's a good deal i think
yeah i saw that
[laughter] [vocalized-noise] yeah exactly
but they won't they won't charge i saw that advertised too that's a good deal
but it's real c- it's real convenient for me i re- i just like being able to go in and do that
and and it's like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so
it's not going to go up too high
so it's good for emergencies
that's what we do on
that's true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then
uh-huh right
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
i know and isn't that terrible
and save all that money
hum
well do you think we've
okay well thanks for talking
you too bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well credit cards
[laughter] well yeah i i i've used them a bit too much sometimes [laughter]
yeah uh
do you have uh like the Visa and MasterCard and and those that are those the ones that you use the the most or
uh-huh
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah just a pretty pretty pretty much uh what you can pay monthly anyway
yeah well we have uh have department store cards for nearly all the department stores i guess uh
uh but but we don't you know don't use them a lot uh
but we do have uh Visa cards uh
my wife has uh has an American Express through her through the company
and uh i don't even have an American Express to use for business so
or i use a Visa all the time
right and uh i i find that they you know they work all right i haven't found anybody that will will turn one down
uh-huh
yeah
the uh yeah it's it's uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling
uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets
and and get some benefits from that i think too
you know
but it's i tell you it's it's really uh it's tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up
you know so that it it's
you've we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses
through the Visa card
so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it
paid back down
it uh
uh-huh
yeah
but uh you know you find it's uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh
that we've been paying real close attention to that so we're using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union
credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use
uh-huh
yeah [laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
right
[noise]
yeah
so you haven't been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then
i have been tempted i ju- i saw one of those ads on TV last night that
you know somebody
call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh
and uh of course it's a nine hundred number which that means they're going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call
well the thing is th- that a lot of those are like they're set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing
and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there
well then they sure they won't turn you down because they've got your money
[laughter]
yeah yeah but that's yeah i know that's the way some of them work anyway
yeah [laughter]
right yeah
yes uh
yeah that's one that we don't use uh i've had uh you know had different companies or you know gas company cards before
but i didn't use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so
so i i can use that and uh
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
yeah but they're of course now they're beginning to to get the picture i think uh like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back
so they quit charging the extra i don't whether they they drop their price back to the cash price or raised all their prices up to the charge price
but uh
yeah
huh yeah
yeah
right yeah that's it's always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for
yeah that's it when when we travel it's we used to use our the gas card just for that you know
and now we don't have of course we don't drive on our trips very much anymore either we used to drive like we'd drive to New Orleans twice a year
and uh we don't go we do- we don't drive anymore when we go down there we usually fly so
you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so
yeah so
yeah so anyway
well
i think they've got enough uh enough information from us anyway [laughter]
okay it's nice talking to you okay bye-bye [noise]
[noise]
[noise]
okay my views it asked for my views so my views on that are yes i do still consider them a threat
and yes i do and the reason i do is because
um i've
with uh Gorbachev was raised and his mentor was i be- it was Nikita Khrushchev i believe
i know it was one of the old old school Russian and uh he he is a definite he is a Marxist Leninist communist through and through
and Marxist Leninist communism is a threat to the United States because um the whole nature of it is to control the world the the whole goal of the Marxist Leninist
theology is world domination
and i do not believe that it has not they've never stated that their goal is not to
you know take over the world and they've never repented of all the massacres all the just the you know the hundreds of thousands of uh massacres they've killed more Jews
and all this and so no i don't trust them a bit i think it's a big scam
yes i do i yes i would all but say i know it's a scam you can't trust him he was the head of the KGB for years
yes he was for many many years he was trained in the old school of Lenin theology and he he's never changed any of his
any of the he he deals in that kind of theology he's you know he might say one thing but what he does is Marxist and Leninist in nature and so
that's why the Russians are so angry with him right now is because they've they know it's a scam and so you know i that's what i feel i don't know what do you feel do you agree with me or disagree
[noise]
uh-huh
right
well if he got out of line too much from the old school they'd just knock him off i mean they're not go- they're not going to permit anyone in that Russian Parliament to get in power that's going to change anything too much so
right
uh-huh
no because they've taken them from the people because the Marxist Leninist theology is to i mean it really is its own religion it it could be classified in theological terms as a religion because it is
but they deny God self is everything self you know everything is um for me for me for me and therefore
right but that's not what they really do they say that but that's not the reality of it even the Bolshevik revolution the whole thing was uh
an attempt to uh gain authority without
you know having to be risen up in authority the best way to get Godly authority is to you know work and and work your way to the you know work your way up not not being promoted by man because promotion comes from God
but when you anytime you see a na- go in and just overtake it and it's take it take authority take control it's a i believe it's a spiritual
thing that happens and it's like a spirit of witchcraft it's like a a bad spirit goes over that nation because you have these people that want they're power hungry
and they want all this power and they want to control all these people and it's not for the people it's for themselves and the way you know that is because they didn't work their way up from the bottom up they went in and they took power and they took authority and they
cut and they stab and and our nation does that a lot too i know it's not necessarily i don't think this is the greatest system either but i just feel like there's just a lot of oppression
over the Soviet Union because of that the authority is there to exalt self that's the whole Leninist theology they deny God they deny any creator they've
forbade religion for years and years and God's the one that opened the doors for their reli- for for Christianity to go in Russia it's not it's not Gorbachev he will not receive the credit for that because one man
saying that could not have done anything God had to open those doors and i believe that the the pressure just got so great from the people because
because that they you know they God just honored their prayers and did a miracle because i don't know we our pastor went to Russia and we work with a lot of churches in Minsk and
and [vocalized-noise] Belev Russia and some other places and so i don't know i have a real heart for Russia that's why i think it's funny we got this call because
i have a good friend my one of my best friends is going into into the underground church cause it
basically it's still underground it
and so they're going in a mission trip into Latvia
in about six months and so they're preparing for the trip you know and it was i sat behind her Sunday and they had their Russia team folder
[laughter] so i thought oh that's cool so anyway so this is kind of one of my little pet babies
[laughter] anyway i don't know i just
i think they want a one world order that's what i think i think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order a one world economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it and Bush is going around talking about it too
and it's like all these pawns on this chess b- all these players on this big chess game you know and it's a world championship and who is ultimately going to get the power who's going to get put in checkmate and who's going to be ruled out of the game
and who's going to have the power over what they want to establish in this one world you know communi- they're always talking about it all the time
yeah
uh-huh
are you a Christian you must be to know new age
yeah
right
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
but yeah i think that they still are a threat but yet maybe a different kind of a threat than a military threat but i do believe that they're a military threat i think
just look what we did to Iraq i mean
right
uh-huh that's true yeah that's true they did didn't they
i know it's it's interesting i still wouldn't want to take them on though
you know i still wouldn't want to take them i still think we need to be very careful but i believe that their economic
an or an economic threat more than anything at this point
in because they because they want control over the i know they want control over the European economic community and that you know that's why i see them diversifying their their power and their control that they have
and like for you know instead of just being oh big tough Russia but i still believe they've uh they've probably got weapons we ca- i mean they they never would sell to anybody else
you know so i guess i feel like yeah they probably i wouldn't want to mess with them but i don't trust them i'm not all like oh yeah they're just like us i i have a heart for the people of Russia
no i wouldn't be surprised if Gorbachev wasn't a s- wasn't a satanist i'm not kidding [laughter]
right
even yeah
exactly even you know in our own country i mean Bush was in the scull and bones the Trilateral Commission and all these groups with ulterior motives and so it's like what on earth is you know are these people ever here and involved in
in the [vocalized-noise] high ranking things i mean when you look at their history and what they've done to their own people what they've done it's like
man can we trust them have they repented for what they did have they made a world apology
we we repented this was wrong we're going to start seeking God and we're going to start seeing God to do for our nation what needs to be done
and even Bush will call a national day of prayer is Bush saved i don't know God knows he says he is and i'm going to trust that with him but i mean it's just no i don't trust them [laughter]
you'd be crazy if you trust them but anyway call it what is it McCarthyism no [laughter] i'm not like that i just got enough common sense that nope you know [vocalized-noise]
to you come repent make a world apology for all the wrongs that you've done and yeah we've done wrongs but we've not done near the atrocities they've done and we need to maybe do that also you know
you know i'm saying i'm not saying like oh America we're so we're perfect over here i'm not saying that either but that's not what the question asked so [laughter] boy i could prea-
uh-huh
really
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
think so
was he
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um you know it's it's hard to say uh if if things change uh change there so
rapidly but uh G- Gor- Gorbachev is i don't know i think i think you you're right he's a chameleon he's just a
he's
he he's just he seems to have flip flopped
on you know uh uh you know when they first came into power when uh President Reagan was in he was this real nice guy and he was
trying to uh win everybody in the West over about what oh what a great reformer he was and all this other stuff but then you know now he's uh
you know [vocalized-noise] crushing the [vocalized-noise] uh demonstrations and and and trying to clo- close it off again so i i i can't figure i can't figure him out i don't know if he's being pressured from
uh above or arou- or uh from other places in in
yeah that
[vocalized-noise] their people are starving i mean they cannot
something they've got to know that something's got to give because they're in their society you're not at
you know it's supposed to be all for one and one for all but that ain't how it works baby i mean that's you know they're not going to do something unless they've got incentives and they don't have any incentives to work
uh-huh
or for the for the people for the people which means everybody else except you
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh yeah you hear a lot about it
but it it's all that it's it's all that uh the new age philosophy and um
yes
oh yes oh yes i know all about the new age philosophy yeah and uh it's
but but they are in such disarray over there they're not in any position to exalt exert themselves over anybody right now like they were
i mean with Eastern Europe falling apart and their whole economic system falling apart they ca- that that we need to take real advantage of that
to to pull their satellites away from them
yeah
well it was with Russian we- they fought us with Russian weapons and they've they found out the hard way how bad badly put together the Russian weapons are
oh yeah oh yeah
uh-huh
yeah
oh of course
no no no
not not not for the leaders definitely not for the leaders
well they're they're they're a secret they're a secret socie- they're a secretive society
you know and they're not going to let you see what they don't want you to see
um
yeah
yeah
no they haven't
yeah
no
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
[noise]
[vocalized-noise] so let me guess it's the Dallas Cowboys
no
oh okay
okay
uh i don't know
i used to be a big Miami fan when they back in the seventies when they were real good
yeah they were my favorite team for a while
okay are you you used to live in Miami
oh
okay
yeah
my biggest team ever my favorite was uh the Los Angeles Rams
yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles
yeah
yeah
but i think they're on the down slide
i don't know
the Raiders huh um
yeah
i think the the team i like rooting for the best which i don't i don't know if they really are the
[vocalized-noise]
a good team but they're an underdog that's why i like them is the Philadelphia Eagles
you don't like him
i like him
i like him because he's reckless
okay
the Broncos oh yuck i hate them
yeah i used to live in Colorado and i i kind of rooted against them and everyone else couldn't understand why
because the people out there are really serious about them
so i
yeah i had fun rooting against them it was
i know
it was kind of funny because i wasn't from Colorado
but um
uh-huh
i've gone to a few games i not in a while
went to uh actually went to a play off game once
when we lived i lived in Maryland and we saw the Raiders play the Colts in the play off
it was like uh at least ten years ago
it went into double overtime
yeah it was a great game
so who do you think's going to win this year
um-hum
hum
yeah
yeah
i think Buffalo's got a pretty good shot
if they hold together
yeah i can't remember his name either
they have the defense to do it
Bruce Smith
[laughter]
no he's a defensive end
he's a big mean guy
um isn't it Marv Levy
yeah that's it
i had fun watching the Super Bowl last year because the the Giants' coach looks like my sister's boyfriend
i'm like what is he doing what's Matt doing out there [laughter] called her up and said hey what's your boyfriend doing out in TV
uh the the Giants' coach um what's his name i can't think of his name
Bill Parcells yeah my sister's boyfriend looks like him [laughter]
so i had fun laughing at it
[laughter]
yeah
looks like him a lot younger but
you hate the Bears i don't really like the Bears either
um
yeah
uh-huh
huh
huh
no i mean that's not what a team's about
[vocalized-noise] guy screws up you got to say okay you screwed up what do we do now and move on
yeah
so that's better than ignoring you i think
huh
huh
wow
huh well Raleigh just got a uh one of the new football teams the new World whatever it is World Football League or
yeah but Raleigh Sky Raleigh Durham Skyhawks
i watched a little bit this weekend a few minutes of the one game
yeah tha- that's who was playing
[laughter]
[noise]
huh
yeah
huh
huh
yeah that would be interesting to see i'm uh every attempt so far i think has failed [laughter] at a second football league
yeah
uh-huh
yeah i remember that
[noise] [noise] [noise]
huh
huh
huh
yeah
well
it will be interesting seeing these games across the you know from London or wherever
Spain
uh-huh
huh
yeah
well they have a whole nation behind them you got to remember that instead of just you know one section of the country like we have
they don't they don't have another football team to root for so
they're going to have a lot more support over there
yeah
definitely
yeah
all right
all right sounds good
huh
kickers huh
i don't know i hadn't thought too much about that i always liked Matt Bahr because he went to Penn State
i like Penn State
my da- [vocalized-noise] both my mom and dad went to Penn State
so [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
Reggie Roby who does he play for
okay
huh
uh-huh
huh
huh
huh
all right well listen i've got to go
it was good talking to you
all right bye-bye
[noise]
all right [noise] um
no
no not originally from Texas
uh either San Francisco or Miami
now San Francisco i think's almost everybody's favorite
and uh
not many people know about Miami [laughter]
Larry Csonka and all them yeah
well i didn't get uh
into football until about Danny Dan Marino's first year
no
originally from Louisville Kentucky
no just uh i liked them
they're pretty good i like their [vocalized-noise]
um i liked Eric Dickers- Dickerson
uh
i don't know
i think the team coming up is the Raiders
yeah
he's getting some teams togeth- some people together there
sometimes i don't like Randall Cunningham
no
uh
i think that's why i don't like him
now my underdog team is the Broncos
yeah
well people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl
oh yeah i know
my sister lived in Colorado for a little while and uh
i don't know she said they go crazy
yeah you'd have the whole town on you didn't you
ye- well i i don't know
i've never been to any [noise] a game or anything like that
i just uh
that would've been great
when was this
okay
i bet that was a good one
i like those close games
right down
this year
that's a toss up between uh
the Giants with them trying to repeat
and oh i hate to hazard a guess uh
i'm trying to go through and see who's got who uh
i'd say the Raiders but i doubt it i think they're going to be next year
uh
San Francisco might try to make a run back but i doubt it
they've lost too many people
yeah yeah i uh
forget who their quarterback is i can see his face
what is his uh let's see
yeah well uh if i could think of some of their names i
Bruce Smith uh he's a guard isn't he
yeah
i shoot i can't even think who's quarter- uh the uh darn uh coach name for the Bills
yeah i think so
Jim [vocalized-noise]
the what
now who who was this
oh Bill Parcells
oh okay
all right i i didn't catch that for a minute
oh there's one team that i out and out hate and that's the Bears
uh Mike Ditka i don't like the way he treats people
i didn't like him from uh
oh one year when uh McMahon was real big for the Bears
and uh he had put Doug Flutie in
and Doug Flutie had called a time out
you know he was in trouble the time was running out on the clock and he goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his back on him and walks away
and i didn't think that's
you don't do that
uh but he you know
it's you know
i played softball and i screwed up coming around third base one time and the uh
the coach actually called time out and came and tapped my tail with her foot and said you know pointed that finger and went ah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and i thought okay
[laughter] you know
yeah well it didn't hurt and she was more you know we was in a uh it was a play off of a sort i guess yeah we was down in there in North Carolina
uh for the uh nationals
i'm trying to think where we were
i don't remember where we were
World League yeah
have you watched any of those games yet
oh i've watched the New Jersey and New York teams you know i- they're combined
i've watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at times
uh they don't look like they know what they're doing
and i know they do
they've got to know
but i watched them when they was playing that team over there in New England i think is where it was and uh
last week i watched them play
and they just they looked terrible
but they got the the NFL backing them so they might make it
uh
yeah well well uh that's how i got to liking Doug Flutie he was playing for the Generals
on uh the uh USFL
and down in Memphis they had a uh team called the Showboats
and uh you know i didn't care for the Showboats much but i did like a couple of their players
uh and a couple of them even went to the uh NFL i just don't remember their names
uh Doug Flutie's the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason
uh i think that's because of what Ditka done to him that just put it in my head and kept it there
but uh i don't know
yeah well i that the London Knights i think is who it is
uh they were a fairly decent looking team
they take the football serious
uh shoot i don't remember remember what the score
yeah that's true
i never thought of it like that
no competition
yeah i know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious i mean
and so i guess they would take it serious i i never thought of it like that
i guess the next time somebody starts harping down i'll just bring that up
that's a good come back thank you
[laughter]
what about your kickers
kickers on so- football teams
oh
i i've i've barely made it out of high school [laughter]
uh but i like uh
Reggie Roby
he Miami
uh
at times i like Kevin Butler on the Bears you know there are some teams uh some guys i like on the Bears
he's he's all right
but they got uh
uh what's his name
i was going to mention Majkowski but he's a quarterback
oh well i can't think of his name
can't even think of what team he plays for either
[laughter] that's real bright
yeah well
all right bye-bye
[noise]
okay do you have you noticed any new um trends in politics
oh really no i didn't hear that
um i think sometimes it's good for people outside they get a different pers- uh perspective on an issue and stuff so
yeah i don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area i don't know on something like that they wouldn't really vote on it or anything though
[noise]
probably so just because they were under his authority and he obviously failed somewhere along the line
yeah
oh um
i think he's got good intentions but i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right
right
uh-huh
oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one i to me it's just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice
no
yeah
Diane Ragsdale
yeah
yeah they really make themselves look bad and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one
no huh-uh
yeah yeah i-
okay was
okay good talking to you bye [noise]
well the one i think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he wants to -sign and did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should
think it i think what's interesting is that uh uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating
i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved
[vocalized-noise]
wha- do you think Gates should resign
w- w- speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price
what do you think of him
[vocalized-noise] he's an interesting person i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his
obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh i guess he's on the County uh
oh Board of Supervisors or i think [vocalized-noise] and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker
and is really quite agreeable uh uh and that the stuff we see in the
you know in the media is uh well he's really just trying to make a political statement i
i find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a
you know course he's got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this but apparently he's a a worker
uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas
i -gree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts
it was it was the strangest i'm i'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base
i- i- i- and i don't quite understand why the power base uh doesn't uh
why they don't go with fourteen one i-
you know i-
and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think
that they have any affect and it's i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it
i don't know you can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh what's what's the lady's name
yeah you can disagree with uh what they're doing and what they're saying but in reality i think they're
they're trying to represent their constituents
[noise] and i think Dallas is doing itself a disservice i think they ought to get on with something important
yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it's like Pauken and Box and these people i think it's i find it interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that
the question is did we get anything good done it's like this whole school issue a- are you involved in the schools at all public school
this whole thing down there where they're they're trying to um
uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else so
i i have got to run to a meeting it's good talking to you i don't think we've gone our our ten minutes but i think we've we've talked long enough so
okay good night [noise]
[noise] we- yeah [noise] a well yeah living in Texas especially i see it [laughter] an- and
[laughter] no no it's terrible
yeah from everywhere too not just from Mexico you know just everywhere
yeah yeah i
yeah they don't ask us do they [laughter] and it's really hard i think on the immigrants because they come over here
all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then the- then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible
yes
really and true how how how how do you figure
did you really
probably more than what i'm making [laughter] maybe i should become an immigrant and go somewhere else
well
yeah well uh you know if it hadn't been for that i guess i wouldn't be here because [laughter] my family came from France and uh one side and one side came from Germany so
and then they're treated rotten the actual Native Americans the Indians well they've got th- they've got the worst deal around
i've never
i've never been been out there
uh-huh
yeah
yeah oh and still are
you know don't have good jobs and living on reservations alcoholics and oh it's terrible it makes me really ill but i've never even been to Colorado
no a native Californian [laughter] but a twenty year Texan i've been here twenty years so
yeah yeah
that's true that's true well did you start with TI out here and then go to
and oh okay and then went to Colorado
so
so do you see a lot of uh well let's see what's in Colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like like we do here
uh-huh
oh okay yeah
yeah yeah
yeah but then you know too on a it's uh of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know they're coming from everywhere but i think a lot about
coming from Mexico because i guess i'm so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean they're but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay
well no that's true it's not but it is i mean they're coming i mean we've we've got
they're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that's working or not i don't know because i don't hear anymore about it
[noise]
yeah
[laughter] i know [laughter] well all the restaurants here too at one time now see how i'm not in the restaurant business anymore so i really don't know but at one time
the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything were all illegals in in most of the restaurants i worked in as a waitress you know it whether that came to a halt i don't know
in California i know it is
is it too in Texas also i i didn't know
but see they'll come in and do work that other people won't do now i don't know about this day and time when there's so many people out of work i know if i was out of work i'd do anything to make money [laughter]
because it's pretty scary when you own a home and you know
you could
you could not
huh-uh
oh it's horrible isn't it
um-hum see and they put their children to work and everything don't they
no
and no one and see Americans wouldn't do it wouldn't they wouldn't live like that
they wouldn't do it
you couldn't get the street people i was just going to say you couldn't get these homeless people probably to do that
i see them on corners with signs saying i'll work for a meal but i'll bet you if you stopped and you offered them a meal if they'd come and do your yard they'd get out of it some way they just really w-
that's right
that's right
i know it
but how do you know [laughter] the good from the bad
oh yes how well i know i was laid off last year but i was i was lucky because i was one of the first groups to go
well in in division one and i got uh went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just
oh boy i worked hard through i went through the J O B's and found this and was versatile enough had a little bit of office experience and they hired me and i was just real thankful and now there's nothing
for all the people who are getting laid off now there's just nothing
you know i know Colorado Springs has been hit also
i don't know i haven't heard any- i don't hear much about Colorado Springs it's kind of like they're kind of trying to be invisible [laughter] forget about us forget about us [laughter]
i'm in in i'm in payroll division nine yeah corporate payroll so
it didn't for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and uh i still hold a red badge and it's still uh i'm still under five years so if they had a layoff in division nine
[noise]
uh
yes i do believe that there is too much immigration now
did you
well it's not just that are there enough jobs for people here now
and yet they're letting more people in daily
yeah yeah i wasn't talking about just Mexico i was talking about Europeans the Eastern Block uh
it's terrible
there's and there's nothing we can do about it
the government seems to do as they wish when they wish
[noise]
[noise] yes living under a bridge so to speak now it's true though that the bulk of of immigrants
are successful
uh i saw it on the news yes the bulk of immigrants legal immigrants to this country are successful you know they pay to end up as tax paying citizens
making uh
above middle class income whatever that is in the the united states now
well yeah you work for TI
uh they say that's due to their work ethic
now i don't know if that's true or not it just might be a matter of luck
but then America always has been
for the immigrant
huh none of us would
yeah
there you know there's only a very few native Americans here
yes they are
well most of them you're right but then i drive through Riodosa
and i think well not all of them have it
desperately bad
you know you've dri- you've driven by
you know the Mountain Gods outside of Riodosa haven't you
oh it's beautiful country up there in the mountains of New Mexico
oh just just gorgeous and that inn is huge and
but now uh like i say
that one tribe is the exception not the rule
you know most tribes were treated dreadfully
and still are yes
oh a native Texan
oh
well i'm i'm i'm a native born Texan but uh you know how it is
we go where the work is
uh in Lubbock
yeah in seventy four
so yes i am i am a long time TIer
[noise] [noise] uh
the ones we see are Americans by marriage a huge number here in Colorado Springs there's an Air Force base and an army base
so there's
people that marry GIs Korean Americans German Americans uh a few Japanese
few Chinese you understand
yeah
well that's not really immigration
yeah
yeah you can't stop them and once they're here to some extent we support them
i don't either but uh what i suspect is that illegals were hired
for a hundred and fifty years of Texas history i don't think they can stop it by a federal edict
i don't think the federal government can stop it by ma- by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more it's just too inbred in the culture you know
i grew up in Dumas and Lubbock and uh every roofing crew was illegal
sure
see uh
still some migrant labor is legal
you know
it is in Texas too
yes yeah during cotton harvest and whenever the the uh tomatoes and all are
well
well the truth of the matter is i don't know what your home payments are but you couldn't make a living on what they earn
you could not
have you seen how those poor people live
migrant labor camps oh my God they live in cardboard boxes
and these fine Americans take care of them [noise]
and i
yes
and i don't hold it against the people
they're hard workers trying to make it
no
no they'll they'll ask for a handout first
no no what they're doing is they're asking for handouts
because if you took them into your home to to work in your yard or whatever they'd know where your house is and how to break in then
or
now that's not true of all of them there are
i i don't i don't know but i'm sure that times being as hard as they are
and times are hard
not everyone's that way
you know good people are being put out of jobs now
from TI
oh so you don't
oh and you got transferred to a different
right
yeah i've i've i've noticed
uh rumors still persist i try not to believe them and listen to them but they still persist that the plant will close
yeah so you're in division what now corporate corporate okay yeah that that must feel somewhat safer
bumping and
[noise]
oh uh so wha- what's your favorite exercise
[laughter]
oh that's pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag
[laughter]
yeah it gets a long ways after a while
[noise] yeah
oh let's see i- i play racquetball mostly
um
[noise] i don't play very much anymore because i've fractured my right ankle twice
and uh fractured it on both sides and so it's kind of weak i'm afraid to get out there and try it again
um
do d- do they give the employees time off during the day to go
a lot of places do that now they'll they'll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise
that's a pretty good idea because people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care
um
yeah i like bowling too i haven't been for a while just don't have the time
but uh
i guess bowling and racquetball's about it for me walking every once in a while but
not a great deal of that
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
[noise] well that's my uh i mean every time i've tried to go you know it's always th- there's always a league bowling
and it it's just so you either have to wait or
you're next to to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain
yeah
yeah especially here in Raleigh we've got such little bitty bowling alleys
little bitty everything here
yeah um a friend of mine works at uh IBM in Charlotte
and they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land
and it's a huge plant i mean this thing's just enormous and that's what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building
i'm not i was never into jogging
i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run
yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on
well
yeah it's that's a tough one to play i- i used to play it when i was younger but
took it out of me then and i'd hate to think what it would do to me now
yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports
[laughter]
as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace i'm going to start playing some racquetball again but i'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore
i'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time
and i'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly
well i've got a pair of those uh that's those are the ones that i wear when i go out there um
trouble is i can't get them tight enough
to to really give me what i feel is support um so i'm i- i- i think probably just an ace bandage would work
but i want to get one of those um padded ankle
what you call its
yeah it's going to cut off the circulation yeah yeah i- i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing
you end up loosening it up and then of course you don't have any [laughter]
yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something
well i guess that's about it for exercise
us old guys just don't do it very much do we [laughter]
[laughter]
well that's that's good exercise and i don't do enough of that either
i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i
um i like grilled cheese too
well you know i- i- i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person
i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day
did you see that
and they're wondering where does that cholesterol go
i- i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are
because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be
i mean i'm i'm sort of strange in a way i'm i'm about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine
yeah good and low
and uh i mean you'd think by looking at me my i'd have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure
jeez i'm not worried about it [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah exactly and and and even then you've got to watch the bread and the water [laughter]
yeah you never know what's in the water either [laughter]
well good talking to you you have yourself a good night
talk thank you talk to you later
[noise]
[noise]
well my
i guess uh sports uh i'm don't play as much sports as i used to because i'm i'm too old for it now
but uh i still play golf
i like to bowl although i hadn't bowled in quite a while
but i guess my main exercise right now is probably golf
uh this last tournament i was in i walked nine holes and almost dropped so i shared a cart
[laughter]
yeah especially on a real hilly course
yeah
oh
they have a real nice uh health club there at TI Lewisville racquetball courts and uh hand ball courts and
it's a real nice facility i just haven't taken advantage of it yet though
no not really
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
i've i wish they'd split that bowling season up into uh
three seasons
right now they have a real short season and a real long season
the summer league is just too long
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah there's there's hardly no open alleys anymore it's all
all taken up
yeah
but uh
also TI has some good uh uh some good jogging tracks
every once in a while while i'm sitting there eating lunch i'll l- look out and see people jogging
i guess on their lunch hour
yeah
yeah
yeah
i i guess i would love to play basketball but
but i don't i don't think i'd have the wind for that i guess of all the sports that probably gives you more exercise than any any sport there is
yeah
yeah
but uh
yeah
yeah i- i
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
you might have to go to those old old old-timey high top tennis shoes that they used to wear
yeah
yeah
tight enough to really support your ankle
yeah
yeah
yeah
only bad thing about an ace bandage if you wrap it tight enough so that really supports your ankle it's going to cut off the blood
yeah
yeah
yeah
but um
that's about it as far as exercise
[vocalized-noise] no [laughter]
unless unless you call pushing yourself away from the table more exercise
[laughter]
yeah well i was cooking me a grilled cheese
yeah cheese is bad for you i know
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah i heard about it
yeah i think it it's all in the metabolism of of the
yeah
yeah
well that's that's the same with me i do both and my blood pressure is i think it was the last time i took it it was a hundred and hundred and ten over seventy or something like that
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
no if you didn't eat if you knocked off everything that they say is not good for you to eat uh you'd be just about down to bread and water
yeah it would have to be a diet bread
[laughter]
well it's been nice talking with you
okay you too
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i don't know but uh i'm twenty two years old and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh
everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is a- all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself
to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know like mandatory you know uh services yeah
because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that
some people were not going you know people that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for years you know maybe three four years getting paid uh by the government or you know
they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some people didn't
didn't have the you know the money they said it's a good way of uh i- coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all
and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do
would be just you know it's like you know
yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean [vocalized-noise] the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there
but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know it's like do this why you know
i i have a i d- i don't have to do anything you know it's like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year they'll let me go and then i can get back to my life
yeah
well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would any- would get anywhere because of the i mean first of all i've never heard of it until this this phone call you know
and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the government or something
yeah
to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what a- what are you crazy i mean there
i mean y- i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue that's still going around that you guys want to bring you know the next [laughter] you know
yeah
but see but you're going there and you know what you're getting into
yeah
yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know
it's uh it's not by choice it's like every- everything else you know it's like if i want to do it i'll do it but you know it's like you know and uh you know i have a background i'm from Argentina
and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service
and but you go into this whole big lottery every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up with other numbers right
from uh from uh one to a thousand
and so if your number is below four hundred you're not going to have to do it
say it's between four hundred and six hundred you might have to do it depending how many people are in your class and you know like you the they right
and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one
and so yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nation's watching you know like i- if it's your class everybody that's your same age is l- listening to the radio
waiting for them to announce the number you know
and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like wow am i going to have to do it
yeah and you know but it's [vocalized-noise] my brother goes everybody in my family had to do it and they go
you know it's just a year and a half of your life that's that's totally wasted you don't do anything else there's no time and you don't do anything
you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out
right
and so i mean but you know it's like
the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean o- one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that kn- you know like the military had
and that was his job you know he got he got you know like three months of uh you know physical training
and then he got to serve all these people [laughter]
you know but that's what they do i mean that's a year and a half of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something
and uh
no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free
well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know people are what if they see you in the uniform
right like for example y- you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant trains they won't ask you if you if you're wearing your military uniform for a ticket they'll just skip you
and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like i- if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you know
it's like please let me ride for free you know it's like i'm i'm living off dad for these wonderful two years which i have to do you know it's like
and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my BS you know it's like by the time
yeah
and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous
so oh well it's been seven minutes
i don't i d- well i don't i don't think they'll ever pass this i i i'm just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i don't read the newspaper that much but i never heard anything about it so
[laughter] so
and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know [laughter] but i- [laughter]
yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it [laughter] oh really dad yeah [laughter] oh well okay
yeah bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
right
sort of like the draft do you know in the Army you're not going to uh uh be i i u- i understand what you're saying i'm i'm twenty four and uh
you know i i don't think that i would be willing to to dedicate you know a year or two years of my life
to a
right
right
exactly
right
right
you just do the minimum yeah
right
exactly
right
right right
[laughter]
exactly
you know a- i and i'm sure there is a problem about uh getting you know the volunteers to do that and maybe they could uh spend a little bit more money on promotion and and uh advertise it a little bit more
uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory
right [laughter]
that would be political suicide for anybody to i would think
right
right
exactly
next big issue up yeah yeah because i think uh [noise] young and old alike uh would would more or less agree on this issue
uh maybe certain religions uh you know i think it's
is it the Mormons or somebody i know at Brigham Young University they have to do like a mandatory uh year or two years worth of sort of service
but uh whatever that religion is
that's right and that is a that is a definite choice uh
and and i i believe it's just that religion that's not a you know a prominent uh predominant re- uh religion so i do- i don't think that that uh issue would hold much water
in a political
right
right
i see
oh i see
right
i see
your age group or whate- yeah
oh Lord
oh okay so you felt pretty good then huh
right
golly
right yeah right there on the borderline huh
jeez
so it's it's no is it not educational training it's st- it's strictly uh military i see
right
God
[laughter]
[laughter]
right
jeez and i guess a minimal pay or
do you they get paid very we-
oh
oh you get a little benefits
oh they know
right
i see i see
right
right
[laughter]
[laughter] right
well yeah yeah you're thirty years old and trying to get your first job yeah
right right
well
that sounds good
well i'm i haven't either and so uh yeah i -on't i -on't think much will come up of it
that's right
[laughter]
that's right it's easier after you're you don't have to worry about it
that's right that's right
[laughter] well hey i appreciate the call talk to you later bye-bye
[noise]
get us going
[noise]
are are you at TI Austin or
oh that's great no uh uh my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us i have another one and she's talked to students uh so i guess they have uh
sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things so they're if you're a computer user so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non TIers so i guess oh yeah
w- we're on finances have you have you retired or uh
oh
oh yeah
oh yeah it's uh that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough uh i've been with TI i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing uh
the salary thing TI doesn't quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're uh
well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess [laughter]
right sure
well i guess i do i do have a long term budget bec- i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while now mo- monthly no i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting uh
i've been married twenty six years
and i did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for i don't know fifteen years or more and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget
uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year i'd say here's how you do the budget in case i get sick or here's how you do the checks you know
one day i gave her the checkbook and i said i'm not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and i've been happy ever since
she does it all now for about ten years and i don't even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and i said i've been a happy man since i haven't fooled with that checkbook you know [laughter] so i know it's a big pain to try to do that
right
right oh yeah
yes i think uh that is a tough uh we all seems to th- seems to be that way
yeah
yeah that's you need to do that i'll i'll i'll give you a hint
i don't know if you're a ta- a radio talk uh person listener do you listen to radio talk shows
listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice he's on oh i don't know what he's going to be in Austin he's on five seventy here inter- oh he's nationally famous
he's a college graduate type guy he's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about
cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff his name is Bruce Williams
he's on national radio uh i don't know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel it's uh it's five seventy up here
and i'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i'm doing chores and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff a- and
he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially
he
yeah there there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget and i i'm not expert again because i don't really do it monthly
right i did start a college fund i'm not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know
sure go ahead sure
oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth
and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there and uh
uh band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip
through bands through leadership uh there's all kinds of civic organ- organizations that will give you you know one shot money
uh you get a president's award if you're you're in in high school doing cer- this up area in Arlington
uh there's a lot of and of course you if you you score high on the SAT you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more
you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she she did very well in school and uh but she only got first year money she got about two thousand dollars it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization
we called there were there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied she applied and got five hundred dollars from that
so
look into that bit
the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything
and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money
uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes
it's just uh like our band gave money away we're a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so
there's money out there
go ahead you can talk i i don't want to i want to chew up the whole line here
oh i'm an engineer i'm uh in fact i'm working the night uh because of the cutbacks and everything uh my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved
and so they put me on nights i i call this my recession job and i'm working nights just kind of covering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i don't mind
uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school
and then i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something i'm trying to study for that now
right uh
um-hum
oh yeah
right
oh sure
well it's tough right now for everybody up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful hey i've got another clue for you for college
another clue for you for college money go to work for UT
uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for TCU you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent
if you're if you work for TCU
yes so check that one out you know
ask them about it call them and because it's full full scholarship now it's uh not room and board but it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at TCU
and her her her uh mother went over there just for that
okay
well i left TI in January but i signed up for this before i did
oh i think that's a that's a good idea
all right
oh no no no no [laughter] actually i left TI um i had basically set my sights to leave TI when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one
because i i def- definitely need to make a little more money and uh i haven't really accomplished that yet but i'm trying
i wish i did i i hope you're you're a person who does things better than i- i don't have a budget that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good
oh long range planning budget mode um i'm a single mom and i've been just uh trying to get
[laughter] thank you it's nice to have someone understand that
h- how about yourself do you have a budget you live by
um-hum
right
well that's great how about your
[vocalized-noise]
[laughter]
it really is it it really is you know uh that was always a a major problem in our marriage what i have always identified is i am
basically good with money it i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it i think that comes from never having enough you know i'm always afraid of [laughter] i'm going to need some and where will it be [noise]
so um no i i've
i've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted and i had outgo that was wha- much higher than what i had coming in
i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me and
and so now that i've gotten you know i lost the house now that i've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay this is the reality this is how much money i have each month
the scary thing is as far as long term i don't have anything i don't know if you have an IRA or uh you know and i've got two girls also and i haven't saved anything for their college and
sometimes i have
um-hum
well i'll check that out
uh-huh
you've learned a lot
well that's that's good to know how
um-hum
well you must have done something you're you're helping your children in school and you're you know
uh-hum uh-hum [noise]
excuse me Jim could you hold on i have someone at the door i'll be right back
thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but we'll find out
oh
[noise] and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on
um-hum
wow
uh-hum
wow oh i'm definitely going to be uh actively looking into that
um-hum
well that's great to know
yeah that's good
oh well you're doing you're doing just fine and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions i was wondering what you do at TI
oh goodness
um-hum um-hum
oh absolutely
yeah
oh i hope you can do that what what i did is i was approached and and i've i went to TI just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending i had been a
a stay at home mom and and i i [vocalized-noise] was very fortunate in starting and i really enjoyed it while i was at TI but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening and i had less than five years
and also i wanted to make a little bit more money so i decided i'd like to go out and try sales and uh i'm i'm out trying to sell
telephone systems to businesses and the potential there is fantastic the reality of it is it's tough [laughter]
exactly
um-hum
okay
yes
they do
i'm going to check that i've got i've got two friends that work at at UT i didn't know that at all definitely i will
uh-huh
well that sounds fantastic
[noise]
hey Dick who's your favorite team
oh how come
oh yeah
yeah
yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren't all that good after all
yeah
yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasn't a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was
yeah yeah he wasn't the guy to take them take them to the championship
yeah i don't i don't know what's out there for quarterbacks and they've got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh
yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but
well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i
uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract
and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh
yeah Walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan
uh more or less [laughter]
and well it's hard uh because
yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games
and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane's first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season
uh so that's where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didn't have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television
then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced we're gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders
for the Cowboys
uh yeah except i don't use them
uh [laughter] then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh
and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line
uh which was really nice [laughter]
and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people i'm talking about sixty through about sixty four
uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs
and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other
and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games
but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games
and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd
and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship
uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay
and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let's see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving
uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn't built with any tax payer money
uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders
so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder
and uh so i had a first choice
and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy
and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line
i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar bonds
that guy so uh that happened then uh
ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by T- i'm with TI and i got transferred overseas
uh through most of the eighties so i ea- each year i just sold my t- i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three year- four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines
and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them
so i still hold them but i don't go
but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices
and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter
well if you don't make smart selections it doesn't do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can't sign them
yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity
on draft day he's got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players
and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them
and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that
and uh uh
yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn't get either of them until half way through the season and they didn't get to go through training camp with them
yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category
everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball
no no no but but you know that's where Bob Hayes was in his early days too
so
hum
oh yeah
yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely
yeah
yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium
uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami
in the Super Bowl the previous year that they'd finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was play-offs every year
oh yeah there's so many people do that
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter] well i own four tick- i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little
and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did
but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now let's see six four's is uh-huh [vocalized-noise] that's a hundred and sixteen dollars
and another five for parking so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know i'm going to watch them on television for a few years
uh boy they don't have one uh
yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn't it didn't they
yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks
and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton
now the one that wasn't playing the one that wasn't playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didn't never lost a lick
yeah
yeah
huh
yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winner's share
[noise]
i think i'm going to have to go with the Chicago Bears
well i like Mike Ditka
and um
of course i used to like Jim McMahon and you know uh Walter Payton
but they got rid of them but i still like Ditka and i think they've got still got a pretty good team if they could just find a real good quarterback
yeah i was kind of i was i was disappointed they came along pretty good but but they just didn't have anybody that could actually go in there and win the game
Tomczak was was trying hard but he just can't do it
he's not a starter
so i'm hoping maybe they'll draft a good quarterback this year i don't know who they're gonna get but i hope
yeah they don't have much in the way of rounds but who knows if they don't get one maybe they can trade for one after all you know i New Orleans picked up uh old uh Steve Mo- or Walsh
who's your favorite team
i think he'll be okay once he gets on [vocalized-noise]
and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah
gee that's too bad
that's too bad [laughter]
it must get a long time between thrills
uh-huh
uh-huh
good grief
you still got them
well
uh-huh yeah
ah the old Kansas City Chiefs yeah
oh yeah
huh
[laughter]
[noise]
good grief
huh
yeah
huh
[laughter]
oh that's too bad
no i'm kind of uh actually uh i think they've got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i i'm not sure how well they'll draft
yeah they're they're having trouble doing a little bit of both
huh
so you you got thirty minutes to make your decision then
yeah
well Smith came on pretty good Wright was
Wright didn't do much
and it doesn't do him much good to run down field if he can't catch the ball
i'll be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in Dallas in of course i worked for TI too for a while
and i left them i guess in eighty two
but i was in Dallas there when uh Roger Staubach and
all the bunches up there and
and uh
i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know what- whatever the Cowboys did that day that it just kind of turned me against them
uh-huh
yeah
i had some friends of mine well i guess it's it's some friends of my parents uh lived in Dallas and of course they're avid you know just avid Cowboys fans
and uh they have this uh little mini Winnebago that they take out there on game day
and uh we used and uh we used to uh my first wife and i used to go out with them all the time because every Sunday you know the
Cowboys there they had like four tickets
they they they had four tickets because their kids were there of course their kids came and went
but uh every time the kids didn't go we'd go and we'd go out there and just you know at at like ten o'clock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff
and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know
is it that much four hundred dollars goodn-
damn
uh yeah
i would imagine speaking of that what are your Cowboys going to do for backup quarterback
we sure figured out that old Babe Wassenberg didn't make it
yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasn't he wasn't worth a damn in the game
you know
are you up there too
uh-huh
but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i i guess being an athlete of course i played in high school and college
and i can understand you know wanting to play but of course as i get more seniority on earth
i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year i'd just be happy to sit there
[noise]
well just any any political event or view or anything
well uh in what way
i don't think he ever told them to to rise up against Saddam Hussein
well unfortunately the the United States as a government can't get involved in a civil war in another country because it's not
it i-
well
[vocalized-noise] i'm i uh
the uh
the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq unfortunately when the the uh Mid Eastern countries were
when the boundaries were adjusted and changed and all the Kurdish were basically forgotten because there's a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq there's some in uh Western Iran and there's some in Southern Turkey
and uh
um-hum
yeah it it's just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn't get their own uh
[vocalized-noise] well their their own government or their own
something originally
um-hum
yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem
the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i under- understand um
the Iraqis the Kurdish are going into Ira- to Iran and into Syria i know that the S- the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict
uh
yeah
and i doubt that they're letting too many Iraqis in
unless the people have proof that they're leaving that they're not going to stay
then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them
well they it's a it's all the countries over there are very wealthy
and so most of the people are wealthy and and they don't have some most of their basic needs for for food and shelter and clothing are met so they don't have any
uh any need that's going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime
yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy but from what i understand though that it's pri-
it's the same type of wealth distribution where you have a the very few are very wealthy
but since there's so much more to go around that that leaves the the lower classes with more
yeah
so you think that that George Bush's foreign policy is poor because of because of what's happening to the Kurdish people
something else done here that would would solve the problems in the Mid East or or
no other than than reestablishing the dominance of the United States in the in the world e-
another thing that was good if you're looking at the balance of the super powers between the United States and the Soviet Union you know the United States went in and led the battle and and solved the problem and the Soviet Union is is a whimpering
is a whimpering country right now because they they've got so many problems that they can't even
yeah yeah
a lot of their their civil problems where they've got their uh Baltic states
rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state
uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people it's the same type of situation where
where where ethnic groups were split up and and our and don't necessarily have the same uh social structure or value systems as the government
it's i it's it's kind of fortunate that that the United States was founded in the way that it did because it's such a mixture of people
with with for the most part with the same ideals
yeah and and
yeah
and and when the when the United States was founded the people
the people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and so immigrants coming in understood that and and it wasn't as if it was forced upon them they chose to come to this country
it wasn't as if a a new government was established when they were already here
so
well i think we've taken up at least five minutes
i've enjoyed talking to you
bye
[noise]
[noise]
[laughter]
views huh political views huh
well i think Bush done screwed up
well as far as like the the people over there he told them to up- have a uprising you know
and overtake Saddam so now that they're listening he's not helping them
yeah that's what he said when it first started that they should think about what they're doing and and you know what he's doing
that they should you know make him understand it it's just like them saying that we should understand what Bush is doing
but they don't have no say so in it i guess
well that's what Vietnam was was a civil war
that's what get you know it's like a double double
standard
you know
oh yeah
well that's where he bombed before with the Turks
that's where he put the chemical weapons before
and killed all them people
what's uh Saddam did
land or something
um
yeah
now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out more or less taken on from each side
because they're getting it from like Turkey closed their borders
you know so i think they're screwed up there
uh-huh
and then Iran i don't know if they can go to Iran or not that wasn't
David
yeah
now they have yeah they're pretty strict anyway [laughter]
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah
[noise] i don't even think that will help right now
because you never know who's on whose side and they're worried about that and
they could get over there and change their mind or something you know
who knows
yeah now that's something i like about the country there's not a whole lot of crime over there as far as petty crime
you know they
yeah
yeah
i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but
if you're the
yeah
yeah
that's better than none at all i guess
they don't have no crime
they
no i just think i don't know if he should have made that statement other than that you know he's all right you know but
i don't know i'm not a Bush fan i'm not really none of them's fan
i just wish something else could be done in this country i don't know what
no that would solve our own problems
[noise] i don't know i think the war was good to a point but then it really didn't help us any
you know
yeah that's it that's all that's that the to let the world know that we could do what we say we was going to that's about it
now they now they have an internal problem themselves right now and i think that has to do with them having problems with food and and and and prices and all of that stuff
um-hum
they they want their own their
yep
oh goodness yes
yeah more or less just whatever it it's really that choice
that's the biggest that's the bottom line is it's your choice it's not told to you or pushed on you it's whatever choice you want to make you can make it yourself
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
all righty bye-bye
[noise]
okay so uh what do you think about it
privacy right
well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh of mistaken uh of
yeah and see that bothers me i'm i'm a i mean i'm i'm very much for drug testing
uh i really am i mean i'm going i'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it
um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect uh
right i mean i haven't had one yet um TI i work for Texas Instruments and and uh we you know we do have the random drug testing but i've missed it so far but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me and what happens if it you know if it
if they catch it they think that i'm you know i'm on drugs and they send me and and have me uh you know go through this this thing you know yeah
right
um-hum
oh yeah
um-hum no
yeah
right
um-hum
right well i you know i'm like i said i'm i'm very much pro testing um and and this is why
uh number one is i i'm i'm kind of i know this sounds like a slogan for the government but i you know we are in a war against [noise] drugs i mean
it's it's horrible i mean
you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not
and it takes some drastic steps at this point and i think personally the drastic step has to be
that um that you can't work if you continue taking drugs i mean it's as simple as that i mean make it so
well make it uh ma- not necessarily difficult but make it so that it's not glamorous
i mean it's glamorous taking drugs or at least it seems that way
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
hum
right
right
um-hum
well then let's let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think
um-hum
um-hum
treatment before for dismissal type thing
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum
personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested
that it could happen um-hum
right
well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive
uh reward or whatever but the reward u- ultimately comes down to what you want
so i i've got to agree with that
so um hum
yeah i think so i think we i think we did pretty good
well [noise] all right well uh i guess that's about it
all right
it was it was talk nice talking to you too
all right bye-bye
[noise]
well um i guess i i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for [vocalized-noise]
the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um because i can't really see why anyone
um who has nothing to hide would object
that's of course that is certainly true yeah
um-hum
sure
uh-huh
sure
if you had to have a drug test yeah
um-hum
um-hum
[noise]
checked out or whatever i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test
but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one uh positive
would not be uh accepted as an automatic um
reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever
but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- uh done
because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand um
i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested
because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry for spe- uh you know specifically but um in many many cases
whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um
depending on the kind of drug he might be on but um and eventually that's going to show up anyway
in the way he works and so on but there's so many things that it would make a difference i guess i
i uh i would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um [vocalized-noise] you know hadn't been tested
yeah
yeah sure
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
make it difficult enough
yeah yeah
yeah according to what you you hear the people who um have serious problems i mean we have um really i guess we're kind of lucky we really only know of one um
young man who uh who's a fam- they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children
um and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um ha- having been involved with drugs but
i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up most of these are young people i work in the education system and so i have a little more contact with that but um
the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be
a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life
because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable i mean he he puts himself in the hospital
fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not
i mean he's you know he's so messed up
and um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty i guess who um just got
really down the wrong path and uh you know i don't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well
um it's horrible
well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um
that that one positive on a drug test would not
constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might
uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem in other words there needs to be um more than
pard- yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some
some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance
uh you know denial of insurance for someone um and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um
that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um
e- even people who might be of the gay community and i'm not an advocate for that particular [laughter] segment of society but um i think that
there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem
um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect
i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested i really don't see why
and
yeah
yeah i don't i don't know why it would be you know um
bad to test just every- and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they
yeah would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that that if if you're going to stay clean and straight then um
you're you're going to do that because you want to really
yeah
[noise]
no that's very true
well it sounds like we agree anyway
[laughter]
yeah
i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough
it was nice talking to you
okay bye-bye
[noise]
are you
well i'm sort of an exercise fanatic i'm big on swimming
yeah
yeah i uh i- i i find i do more swimming in the wintertime than i do in the summer
yeah
uh my wife has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime
but it's the winter months that i can get serious about swimming
well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a while [laughter]
yeah well i find that uh if i want to lose some weight that uh i can't do it unless i exercise as well
yeah
well last year i had a campaign to lose about uh twenty pounds
and uh i wound up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during the year
yes uh Fairfax County has uh a number of uh park authority uh recreation centers
and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool
and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh there's a fifty meter uh pool called Oakmar
and it's sort of a uh
uh a landmark pool it's a very uh excellent design
you know top rated pool
and good uh gallery facilities for competitive uh events and things like that
it's Olympic size yes
no i uh work for E-Systems
which is which is another Dallas company [laughter]
but i'm at the uh Melpar division here in uh Falls Church
hum
yeah
yeah
yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office
and so i hit there at seven o'clock in the morning
get in a half hour swim and still make it to work on time
um well i get to put work after work i- i have to hurry home and uh and help out with the kids and
fix things around the house and all those kind of chores
so the morning hour is my time to myself
oh you
oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then
yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i
yeah
but you put out a lot of energy uh keeping up that pace
yeah
hum
[laughter]
i haven't seen that no
yeah
oh okay
yeah i- i see some of these exercise machines that uh it looks like you're constantly walking up stairs
and uh i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there
yeah
yeah i can see that well i a lot of people complain about swimming that that's uh boring
but i find that uh
o- over the years i've developed the ability to keep track of my uh workout
and at the same time uh do some creative thinking while i'm swimming
so i- i can write letters to congressman and uh organize reports and uh
i- i count them i- i swim a sixteen fifty every day
and uh so that's sixty six lengths of the pool
and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh
you know every now and then when i do check up and say where is my count i check it relative to the clock and
and i also wind up coming out even [noise] even side of the pool
i usually uh [noise] look forward to it uh
and in fact some mornings i uh almost feel a necessity
to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins
uh thing but uh when i'm exercising regularly i- i feel the need to to do more exercise
yeah
[noise]
um-hum
and
yeah well s- sometimes uh i've had the effect that if i swim in the morning
uh i get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time
and
just barely
it amounts to running out the back door and uh heading for the pool jumping in swimming some sprints or something like that and then running back again [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
well i've i've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem [laughter]
then nobody really complains if i uh if i come in
sort of half wet [laughter]
almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing
and uh she she twisted
snow skiing she did water skiing when she was uh young
and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at one point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition
uh but she's taking up snow skiing and she got me involved
so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill
and we had another expedition where we took the three little kids up and uh taught them to ski
and
uh seven eight and ten
yeah it wa- it was delightful watching them uh learn they uh they went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own little way
uh the one we thought would be the most timid
uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn
and the other two got jealous and they went out and says well i'm going to go and do it too so they learned too
and uh we went to a good resort and the instructors were there uh took a liking to the kids so next thing you know they're they've got the kids off on the uh some of the bigger slopes
the place where we went has a separate area for beginners it's called the Sun Bowl
and they just put instructors out there
and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band
and if you see an instructor who's not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they'll show you things
and so they're pretty much available all day long
and you can either take instruction or practice or or just enjoy yourself whatever you like
and the instructors are very enthusiastic and of course they picked up the kids and and took them on some of the more advanced slopes
uh yes my wife did some last year
and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year
we were lucky um
we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania and the first time we went up there the instructor said that was the first uh really good weekend that they'd had this year
and uh Charlotte went up in the uh middle of the season
okay are are you an exercise fanatic
oh really
well that's way north too i guess you have to swim inside huh
really
wow
um-hum
oh well that's good that's that's one of the best ones i understand no stress on the joints
[laughter] yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing
yeah that's true plus even if you lose weight and don't exercise it ends up just l- you know looking unhealthy
wow
do you swim like at a at a Y or
oh
hm
really
is it like Olympic size
wow
are you are you a TI employee
what
[laughter]
yeah
well the reason i ask you i i'm a TI employee and uh we have a fitness center you know that's on site
that makes it real real convenient
because i tend to find that once i get home that's it you know
i tend to not want to go anywhere after that but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all the all this machines and
all that sort of stuff we're not we're not high rollers like Dallas we don't have a pool but [laughter]
oh that's good
oh that's great
yeah morning is usually a better time to exercise but i usually find that after work is when i have the time to do it
[laughter] you have honeydews
yeah
honeydews
yeah
well that's gr- i- i like to to work out some in the morning but it's not like [vocalized-noise] you know i usually use the video or
something like that
to do
plus i like to dance you know
um-hum um-hum and and on Saturdays i go to a jazzercise class that's my
oh it's fun jazzercise is really fun
yeah there there's a lot of energy i- i- i like to belly dance too but there's not the same you know you don't get the aerobic
workout as much
but jazzercise is wha- it's it's so much fun that you forget you're exercising you know aerobics you don't forget [laughter]
you know you're exercising oh and we started the bench aerobics too
i don't know if you've seen that that's
that's a fairly new thing it's just like uh one step
you know it's like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and up down do different
variations you know change feet and
and you'd be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up
it's a it's a lot quicker and and that way it's completely low impact here's no jumping or
you know no jarring on the knee bones [laughter]
yeah uh-huh
yeah that will do it yeah we have one of those too but it's boring
oh but that wouldn't be boring like walking up stairs [laughter]
yeah
right
well do you count your laps or do you just have a time segment that you
jeez
yeah
yeah
well that's neat do you do you look forward to doing it or do you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started
yeah
yeah
um-hum
and then when you don't for some reason you feel real lethargic
it seems like [noise] like the the the less you exercise the tireder you are i'm sorry
yeah yeah that's true sometimes i find i have to kick myself though to get started and once i get started you know it's it feels good
wow do you have time to do that in your job
[laughter] course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably don't have that problem [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
[laughter]
you know that's a problem with with getting getting that much wet
but
oh [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
well gee well that sounds neat and you do that like like almost every day or what about weekends
oh
water skiing or snow skiing
oh
um-hum
oh really
oh that's good exercise
God really [laughter]
how how old are your kids are they
oh that's a good age to start something like that
um-hum
really
little competition there [laughter]
really did they have a separate uh like class or something for the kids or is it everybody together
um-hum
oh
um-hum
yeah
yeah did you all start this year or last year
um-hum
[laughter]
do you all have have you had a good snow this year
really
so do you have any hobbies
yeah uh
i'm an avid gardener um
um i consider that a hobby i don't know they were like suggesting like handcraft things which i guess that's a really true true hobby
i- i- i think anything that you enjoy
um it doesn't really have to matter i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really
well did i
yeah well i don't know i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong i says you go pay to have someone do it
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something
oh yeah um well right now we um start our seeds inside
we'll start them inside and uh
yeah well we usually start them right in the house my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and
and the wi- a wind storm come and knock it down but she's had really good luck i mean it next month well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks
and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of May you can leave them outside you might put them in the ground just the first week of June
but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May
oh
yeah well well we live we live really close to Lake Champlain which is in the Champlain Valley so we're a little we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so
yeah we are a little lucky well my brother lives ten miles from here and he gets frost and his crop gets killed
yep from Plattsburgh Air Force Base
[laughter]
but um
yeah Plattsburgh's kind of a it's uh it's uh depressed economically
when you go across the lake um i don't know why we have so much going for us
i really don't i'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and they've never had well they've had layoffs recently but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never
and now we're looking at serious i- i mean i'm a technician when they start getting rid of technicians
[laughter]
well i interviewed with them but i didn't want to go to Texas
even though my um mother's people are from Georgia
yeah
well i guess we have to get back to hobbies since
stick on the subject
well interesting thing that i do is with gardening uh my sister grows flowers that you can dry
and you can make fl- uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus
you you know what eucalyptus is it's
yeah it's got a s- yeah at first i'm like oh how why do people like this but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while people put them in
[laughter]
yeah it's it's it's like a fad thing i- i don't know it's i've never heard of it in the last five years i've used so much of it that
i hate to
yeah it is
[laughter]
yeah it it looks really po- potent stuff
but uh it's yeah i think it's the greatest stuff in the world though it's jeez they i make all kinds of things with it we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers
i- i almost want to start a business doing it but i don't i i'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business
yeah it is especially with the being in on the creative as- aspect on the crafty end
you know after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go boy this this is kind of ugly [laughter]
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby um he does it believe it or not i wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife
because he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here it's almost a pattern i mean you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter
and uh this guy was going nuts and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i don't know what the equipment's called but planes and things
and s- set him up and h- he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture
he gets right into it and uh
[noise]
yeah it's a it's a really good thing
yeah because it's keeping him sane and plus it's keeping his marriage so and and plus he's getting on in his years now he's he's not that old but he's getting
to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that and uh it's really it's it's uh hard work i couldn't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it he d-
he dowels everything and it's all got to line up [laughter] and uh i don't think he goofs too much i don't to see too much scrap around
God i'm envious [laughter]
is it going to be
is it going to be really dry it are you pl- are no i always plant trees in the fall i don't know why so the the cold weather can kill them
but i guess
oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall um
yeah
yeah and uh when you have time to do it [laughter]
my sister does uh flower gardens she gets right into it
she spends lots of money on them and i guess a lot of people do do do that they landscape their whole house with flower gardens she's got like
just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and bulch ba- uh tree bark all over her lawn [laughter]
it gets it
do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it
so you don't have a lot of tree coverage
because goi- going to make
yeah see um wh- uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees and they just shade everything
uh it's in Georgia it's yeah it's right outside of Macon and and it's just a i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is
but when i think of Texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass [laughter]
yeah
so it's that dry heat
well where is it is it Hous- wasn't it Houston's humid
yeah
it's humid
[noise]
well right at the present time nothing real special i kind of like gardening and i'm kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing i don't have any real serious
oh okay i think you're
um-hum
yeah
yeah
well yeah i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too
no i- i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation then [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you've still got a couple months to go haven't you
uh-huh oh yeah that's right you would yeah
in cold frames or whatever the
um-hum
huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
i've i've lived in in Texas and New Mexico most of my life but i did once i spent one winter in North Dakota
and i- i remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up
and uh [noise]
oh yeah
okay because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit yeah
you're at
yeah
you're right across the uh lake from what Plattsburgh
oh
yeah yeah
yeah i had i had a cousin that was stationed there
Plattsburgh for a while he he remembers lots of snow [laughter]
oh really oh
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah well i'm i'm working for TI Texas Instruments down here
oh yeah
oh [laughter]
oh yeah
yeah we're getting to where straying i guess yeah
um-hum
hum yeah
yeah yeah the they s- uh it's sold in the
hobby stores and nurseries it's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but
yeah i didn't realize what it was for a while i'd walk into a room where some of that and i'd wonder what is that you know and then one day i- i realized that it was eucalyptus
yes
yeah
that's the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something
maybe that's why they're
[laughter]
so slow i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something
yeah
[laughter]
yeah that's that's a big step yeah
yeah uh
[laughter]
um
hum
yeah
um-hum shapes and planes and
routers
there was a program on TV down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little
little companies of one and two guys you know up there espec- this particular one i think was in Maine and New Hampshire
where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in they may be the same kind of people you're talking about you know they've they've got twelve weeks to do something
and they they're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer
so yeah
yeah yeah
yeah
[laughter] yeah
yeah
that would be really t- you know like say the
oh man yeah
yeah yeah that's that's something now our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties
and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight and uh
this is uh it's really nice out tonight almost hated to come in
yeah these were uh trees that that wintered
i d- don't know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that
and they come down here and they'll sit in the nurseries here and they'll go ahead and and uh leaf out
so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's or trees that are already leafed out
yeah mostly i think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall let them winter
yeah through the fall but uh down here well it's done both ways it it just kind of depends on what you're
what you're planting but uh all the shrubs and
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that'll really do well
everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of June and then the real the heat sets in
and June July August are you know most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers
uh we're in a relatively new area we're kind of out of uh the natural tree area we're kind of up on a on a higher on a slope
so we don't have where we are right now there are very few trees this was this was this was pasture land but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know they're really
um-hum
now where is this
in Georgia yeah yeah
well i tell you what now see East Texas there's two parts of Texas East Texas and North Texas Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything
the two cities are very very identical so if you were familiar with Atlanta
uh
uh well no it's it's uh not dry at all it it's humid
Hou- Houston is awful
[laughter]
Houston is really humid now
okay
well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much
um-hum
yeah
yeah
how true
yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know it's
that's not what i would consider a luxury
yeah
well um i- i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and
how it's being managed and so forth i mean i- i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money
it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and
but not really
[laughter]
yeah
well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and
that
don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and
uh you know they're studying some
obscure
uh bug you know in some other part of the world or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong
i
that's right
yeah and i think here lately they've
been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the nation in trouble
the war
um-hum
yeah
and i think that's a mistake
somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away
we know what trouble they got into [laughter]
yeah
well i- i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with
uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the IRS
disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of
penalties and interest that they can attach to that
because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double
that amount and
yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know
yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time
um-hum absolutely
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah
that's a lot
well i haven't counted
i- i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i don't have any idea
yeah
wow
yeah
yeah
yeah
well i- i have another thing that i thought about too um
for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is
and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but
here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it
so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much
you know it's kind of a vicious circle there
and then they took that away as far as
being
yeah
huh-uh
[laughter]
well you can come over to my house and spend it [laughter]
[laughter]
i wish i had some to spend [laughter]
[noise] no no i don't i just don't have any
[laughter]
[laughter]
yeah that's the way it goes
[noise] well i guess we probably talked just about long enough
[noise] yeah
yes
uh-huh
i don't know
you too
[noise]
okay good-bye
[noise]
there we go
yes and no income tax no i uh i look at it this way uh you've got to pay for the privilege of living here
but uh
being a uh [noise] a rec vehicle owner well in fact i live in a motor home
i'm a full what they call a full timer
and uh it burns gas like crazy i only get seven miles to the gallon
i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it uh
uh what's the word they use anyway a lux- a luxury tax
they ga- add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor
and it doesn't bother me any because i've quit drinking and i quit smoking
so that doesn't bother me but i don't think it's fair it's it's too um
um it's attacking just certain people
and even with the gasoline tax
no uh [vocalized-noise] fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury but it's a necessity today
and uh as hard as they try to get these
public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh re- really got off the ground
or that accomplish what they set out to accom- to accomplish
what are your feelings on it
yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
no you don't look what happened on the last presidential election
read my lips
and what happened they turned around and double crossed us
so uh i mean you you can't believe what you what you hear
oh
uh yes
[vocalized-noise] i agree and and uh
uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries we need
enough help here in this country
they're still people starving people here why should we help starving people somewhere else
abs- absolutely
now i can't wait for uh i- i could just picture wha- what's going to happen here in the not to distant future
we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh
uh uh the
uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast
and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and uh
the next thing you know we'll be t- turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it
[noise] oh definitely
well another thing now they they keep the
decontrolling different things first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not
exactly and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled
and and uh uh transcontinental or u- u- u- u- interstate
uh trucking
i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket
uh prices went uh sky high
you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they're reach the point where they're cutting their own throat
and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it th- that's government controlled
but um
oh by the time you get through with the uh
the penalties
uh i agree i think the IRS is uh just too powerful
there should be some sort of a control on it
and they should be a little more humane
uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess
uh that's that's one of my pet peeves
[noise] i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget
very simple give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh
uh the private industry
i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year
it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten
well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more
a day or so more than the average
but uh government is ridiculous
just think of the money they could save
i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway
why not get the work out of the people
and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes
but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it um
i'm single i have no
uh dependents or anything my children are all grown
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes
um very true that's
and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRA's or something and and w-
when you turn
when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it
and the tax is a lot less
but in the mean time you u- used them
you've got your money tide up
in a low relatively low interest
uh bearing investment
i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today
um me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it
[laughter] well you
well do you do you need some help spending yours
oh
oh uh-huh well that's my problem too i'm i'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid
um-hum
uh let me ask you something did you get a catalog or something from these people yet
you did
i've everybody i've talked to has received one and i haven't gotten mine
um
well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you
and uh -til next time
bye-bye
[noise]
well i haven't uh you know when the war was on i watched um CNN and um Nightline
pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with Easter [laughter] and spring break with the kids i um
i hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there have you been keeping up
uh-huh
uh
hum
start it
there's no official document signed or anything
well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and
tried to read about the history and it it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there
ever [laughter] in thousands of years of history
yeah
that's right and it just it's just not people they
and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves
and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for
uh Israel and
oh yes
hum
oh no
he
and got it over with [noise] well i just [noise] there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace
and um with and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
yeah
yes
yes
right
right right
yeah
right
right
[noise] well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say an- and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep
we're not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while i'm really glad that they
uh i it was important to de- demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments
i don't ho- i'd i hope we don't try to keep uh
in there and try to
keep our fingers in the pot and try to
stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay
yeah
yeah
yeah and
yeah
uh-huh i noticed that
well i don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they
[laughter]
yeah
history
uh-huh
no
no
well i guess i better go i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator
but yes well i enjoyed the topic i hope you ha- have a good day okay bye-bye
[noise]
okay
uh-huh
uh well [noise] uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN
debate or whatever you want to call it that uh
voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess
you know the thing really isn't over they uh
they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped
and wait to see if Iraq would accept a a permanent cease fire situation though
as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh
uh had uh set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to
so i guess from what i understand the thing could just
they could just t- they could take off at any moment without uh
you know any
uh-huh you know any local um
you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet
not yet not yet at all
uh-huh
no
yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know
[laughter]
uh-huh
yeah the uh the thing that's kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force
and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock
so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi
well he's still in Korea and his buddies are home now [laughter] he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home
yeah
uh-huh
yeah the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait
the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's
uh you know you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up
and the British and the French and the Eng- yeah the British and the French mostly
decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um
geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh
social or cultural
things at all so the country of uh of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense
except that it is an accepted
place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's
it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two
so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up
and it's just that this was an excuse
you know to to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab
uh
uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh you know a legitimate player in the game over there you know the
we i don't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture's just so much different but uh
uh we are now a legitimate player in the
in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we
you know we defeated
you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know so
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate
so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a a kind of a a might makes right sort of attitude about it and you know we've got the power
yeah
which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something
and then and then they could call the shots for the next
you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and
caused problems so
yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah that's that's the uh
that's that's the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old
you know Vietnam um
problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out
Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung
uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the
told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think
is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands
and whether the the United Nations i don't think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't
uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out
which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
but uh you know
oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them
you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either
so that's that's a little rough you know we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing
so
yeah
oh [laughter]
oh well that's that's fun
you too bye bye
[noise]
what type of lawn and garden work do you do
i see do you have a garden
we do the same thing it's i just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet
i see yeah you do a lot more area than i do i've all the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking it's all the dirt i have left in my backyard
well i enj- i enjoy fiddling around it's cheap entertainment
it is uh-huh
that's right
yeah i enjoy excuse me go ahead
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right that's right
uh-huh
uh-huh takes a lot of room
it sure does i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe my goodness what a mistake that was
they do well it was very good it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area
it's the first and only time i've done that we don't do anything exotic we just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that
my wife used to plant a few snow peas i don't really care for snow peas well she just plants a few for herself
yeah
did you really
oh i see okay we normally don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground
probably so yeah you can get a head start on it
i guess it it might would yeah um-hum yeah
[laughter] well it will make it will make them taste better i'm sure
sure
you got to inspect it yeah
sure sure
yeah
no i this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system and boy it is really nice it sure beats dragging hoses around
that's right
uh-hum that's right it's really nice
uh-huh
yeah i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard i i really don't enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired now i i've lost my excuse for that so i'd have last last couple of years i've done it myself
uh-huh
yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
it is kind of expensive it is of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too [vocalized-noise]
that's right If i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something that's right
that's right i'm i'm kind of bad about that i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really can't i really don- you know don't want to spend the money for it yeah that's true uh-huh
that's right
i'm not limited to just mowing it on Saturday morning you know i can do it on most any day of the week
uh-huh
uh-huh
that's right
yeah
yeah
that's coming up here pretty soon is it this weekend
it's pretty soon
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh i believe it is too
we
uh not a whole lot uh i i don't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then again i don't want the bugs eating it upping either
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh right uh-huh
yeah
uh-huh
that's right
absolutely they really go through it they really do
yeah
um-hum you know cut worms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too boy they'll strip them
uh-huh
yes uh-huh
uh-huh yeah
yeah i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before i've got uh my garden is shaped that i can it's kind like this uh box shape
so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure and you know various other things raised it up
and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have oh i'll have less of a bug problem any- at least they they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah right
uh-huh
that's right yeah you you have to work on you really do
uh-huh
that's right when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden so i had a good i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with it
no i don't i did it by hand
uh-huh it wasn't too much of a job really like i say it's just
uh-huh
uh-huh it'd be handy
yeah um-hum
uh-huh yeah
it might be handy
yeah they're pretty neat little i've never seen one
uh-huh oh yeah
yeah
uh-huh [noise]
right
uh-huh
yeah that would be neat sure would we've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind
uh got uh tomatoes that are starting to bloom and uh i've got carrots i mean yes i've got a few carrots up and i've got some radishes up and as a matter of fact i've already done a second row of radishes and uh the green onions are coming along
snow excuse me
yes i've for the first time we planted them this year uh-huh yeah yeah we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left but we've got some this year
snow peas are up and my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side and uh they're up and doing fine
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah that's kind of a let down
oh i bet they were
that's right we use a lot [vocalized-noise] we sure do
um-hum
yeah one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many
um-hum
yeah uh-huh we did that too
uh-huh
sure makes uh makes a colorful salad too yeah
uh-huh
[laughter] we planted some uh yellow peppers this year we've tried it before and nope we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year
they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something
yeah we enjoy fooling around with it
[noise] beets yeah we've got some beets uh-huh
um-hum
i've never done potato we used to do it at home when i was a kid we had a huge garden
um-hum
uh-huh it takes a yeah it does take some space
yeah
uh-huh
i see
uh-huh
uh-huh that will be neat yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah that will be neat yeah
absolutely they're expensive
i don't know unless it labor intensive or something i really don't know yeah
yeah that'd be interesting yeah
sure yeah that's interesting
well i'll let you go it's
[noise]
well i do it all [laughter] uh yes i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and
yeah i have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four it's a long skinny one and
oh i see yeah i see
right right yeah it's nice to get out in the open air and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh
sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know i grow a lot of things a lot of food and
sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant it and some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh
squash or something like that [noise] plant one of those and it takes up your whole space [laughter]
oh yeah th- yeah they they just run all over the place don't they
right right see i
the basics uh right
uh-huh yeah that's what we do too
right peas i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago the first one they started them indoors this time i read it and so i
yeah
i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that
but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered and i i don't think i'll do it again [laughter]
oh yeah yeah i enjoy it i come home from work and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and the [vocalized-noise]
inspect it and the kids want to swing and i push them on swing and
and i wal- i mow my own lawn and and i do i don't have a sprinkler system i i don't enjoy watering especially
oh how oh
yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about and yeah i i usually get it started for my wife and i and she moves it around every other day [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah yeah
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of the loop but um
but they want too much money yeah
right right but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself
right and the weed come up and all of a sudden you've got to do something else yeah
yeah
yeah well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and do it and
and stuff when you only have
right
when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work
yeah when they when they switch to switch when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour
i don't know i really don't know it just seems like i here it on the news the day before and uh i i think it's coming up here soon
yeah yeah are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden
uh-huh
right
right i i it seems like they come in spurts one year i didn't put anything on and i didn't have any problems
next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they are called cabbage cabbage loppers or whatever they were just covered with them i mean i went up i didn't go out there for about three days you know because i
and went up there one day and the plant was nothing left but a stem they devoured it that quickly
and they they have a you a good appetite [laughter] and they would you know i i picked off like twenty of them and i go
yeah so i got that uh what is that safer soap uh B T spray this year and i've been watching them every day and i've and i haven't seen any signs yet so if i see any signs i'm going to spray them and uh
right
well the good stuff huh right
right yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up and uh i had sandy loam hauled in i had a dump truck come and dump it
on my driveway i guess that's what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the Texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil
right then you know and you know if i i didn't wanna wait five years for it to be good enough to grow you know
[vocalized-noise]
uh-huh do you have do you have a rotor tiller small enough you have a just do it by hand yeah yeah
yeah i'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines with
and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that my neighbor across the street has one he always uses it to dethatch his lawn i see him out there and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it yeah yeah
i have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van and bring it home and
check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it
that would be nice
uh-huh
what have you got growing right now
uh-huh
hm
uh-huh yeah
okay what kind what kind of onions do you grow do you grow those those ten fifteen Y
oh they they are the best
uh-huh uh-huh uh those
i see
yeah i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because
you know we got on- onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like October and uh
we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare
she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better
right right we froze a lot of peppers we let some turn red
and some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas and and chops them up in recipes and things like that
oh yeah put them in salad yeah you're you're making me hungry here [laughter] yeah
oh
yellow peppers huh
yeah sounds like you have a real good garden
just let me see what i got i got the peas and i've got some broccoli
uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets
uh and i planted potatoes too
oh the potato they were deli- they're delicious but they you don't get seem to get that much for the space they they do
some beets uh potatoes [vocalized-noise] and i've got some tomatoes still growing in in containers i got to wait for a place to to to free up um
our our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year we've got some good um um Hybrid Burpee uh pickler cucumbers and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own and
so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store i know it i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know
[laughter] i guess but we're going to try that and see how that works an experiment i'd like to try you know just try something new every year that i haven't tried before and
[noise] well
[noise]
so do you have a computer at home
do you i got my i got my first one i've been at TI forever and i found an engineer selling his really old TI PC
uh i think so no not ninety nine it's one of the full TI PCs
and he's an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it running for like two hundred dollars so i thought that
well now it does
no no no no it's just the old PC and it has two floppies it doesn't have a Winchester it doesn't have anything but for what i need just keeping records it does just fine
oh really
i'll be darn when i uh i'm in uh Plano right now but when i was up at uh McKinney i had uh IBM PS two i loved that thing i loved it
well i have kids fortunately that have left grown gone thank heaven
to them i admit it it was fun leave
the empty nest syndrome is a myth there's no such thing i mean
it's nice it really is
yeah we're talking though uh on my
you know i don't really know i knew when i bought it but i don't know right now i've got a little program uh genealogy program called Family Ties
and i can research and go to the library and and discover who married who what year and all this sort of thing and come back and load it all into my computer and then when i want to
say [vocalized-noise] this is going to be a present for my grandchildren tell them all okay here you are and then i can sort it all that they can trace it back to their parents and the grandparents and on you know do an explosion
and it all prints out up to five generations per chi- and you know you can select the child and get the whole thi- i think it's just as neat as it ca-
oh how fanta-
how fantastic
oh
get out of here
for heaven's sake i've never heard of one
i didn't know anything about this that's fantastic
i'm familiar with Commodore
well i'll be darn
what
what do you have at work
so you're into com-
oh we have some Suns in this building uh i'm a buyer and and i help them with their maintenance contracts and repair and things like that just it's it's not much of my job but it you know i- i do come in contact with them
those are expensive machines
good grief
why do you think TI has not used the Omega because uh-huh
um
oh i see
uh-huh
yeah
well that's wonderful i'd never even heard of this
so your kids were having a good time and you were working
that's marvelous just marvelous
well i work in I A Smith so we're forever looking at something else uh i you know i work
well you know you'd be surprised how many of the various ones are coming in and giving us demos at all times and i sit in on all this stuff
let me ask you something uh if you were if you needed to go to another
town somewhere you know fly to a to see a supplier and do a review there could you put your presentation on a television and just kind of send him the disk instead of going yourself
uh-huh
so you could just say okay fellows we've got a problem get everyone in the room and let them see this tape rather than buying an airline ticket
uh-huh
how much w-
how much would this cost
yeah for that whole operation
we don't need that type we don't need that type of graphics that's just not necessary
i sure do i have an Amiga it's an old one thousand model but it's still compatible to the uh late model Amiga personal computers the three thousand and the two thousand even the five hundreds out now and i love it
yeah how about you you got one
[noise]
oh a forty four
ninety nine i mean or some-
i got you right
my goodness gracious
well you sure made a savings there i have never heard anything to beat that that's just terrific d- does is it IBM compatible type
oh i see [noise]
uh-huh
well if you ever decide to get a newer later model think about an Amiga because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen
it's got four thousand ninety six color graphics it's got real-time animation capability there's a [vocalized-noise] world of games for it if you're into that but it can do word processing you can import pictures into your documents and uh it just does everything a PC can do but it does it better
uh-huh
uh-huh
you did well i i venture to say your you and your kids if you have any would enjoy the Amiga better
oh really [laughter] well you're not supposed to admit that [laughter]
okay
well my wife and i are gonna be glad to get ours out of the house too i know exactly how you feel
oh really
i'll tell her [laughter] we're sure not staying with the PC su- subject too well are we [laughter] well how how how much memory you got have you got on your machine
[vocalized-noise]
oh yeah uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
well that's neat
yeah i'd like to have a piece of software like that for my machine now on my machine i've got a microphone hooked up to it and i can digitize me and the wife and kids all talking and all that but i can hook a VCR up to it and take our picture
and then then then if my parents had the same kind of computer which they don't they don't have a computer but if they did then they i could send them [vocalized-noise] all that on a floppy disk and it would play out for them right there on the computer and they could click it to see each next scene
but that's all possible to do on the Amiga and frankly my VCR camera cost more than my computer did
but you can do all those sorts of things on the Amiga
yeah well lot of people don't know about Amiga it's put out by Commodore they made the sixty four but this is a machine that they bought from a company that got started up in California
yeah well they make the Amiga and uh not only that but the Amiga is Unix compatible so if anybody around there is using Unix and they want a cheap Unix work station that cost under about four to five hundred dollars then the Amiga runs Unix
and uh besides uh being able to do all the other things i was telling you about
it's a fantastic machine if you've got to have IBM compatibility they've got a card you can plug in and you can run IBM software but the machine is so powerful i don't need it
uh i use a Sun work station at work but i'm i'm in the process of purchasing Amiga to use it as my desktop computer but research work though i use a Sun Sparc station
are you
uh-huh
i know well see uh the the Sparc stations run about twelve thousand dollars in color and an Amiga runs only forty seven hundred in color
so it makes a real nice cheap Unix compatible desktop work station and see i've got one at home and everything i run at work i can run at home by you know same sort of stuff and uh
uh it really makes it quite nice it definitely does i have four and a half megabytes on my machine here at the house and uh sixty five megabyte Seagate hard disk and it rips
the Amiga
well because it's made by Commodore and uh most people all they know about is IBM compatible because no most people in this country that know anything about computers don't know much but they do know about IBM
so when the PC came on the market and then it was the first one on the market earlier than the Amiga was but when it came on the market people just naturally assumed that well if IBM makes it it should be the computer of my choice
and they intend to look around very much so as a result Macintoshes and and uh Amigas didn't get a fair break
where but honestly an Amiga is far and away a much better PC than the PC will ever be it has a full multitasking operating system during the Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines i backed up my hard disk because i used my Commodore sixty four as a terminal to it like a main frame
so i was copying files off my hard disk to floppies and they were playing a game using the uh joy sticks and they never even knew i was there except i was sitting there and i was pushing another floppy into this little slot uh while they were doing their thing to keep copying files out
you can't do it on any machine a Mac or anything made
yeah it's kind of neat not to mention the fact that it's got four thousand ninety six colors and you can't get more than two fifty six out of a PC or a Mac either one
yeah that's right i can do that exactly [laughter] you sure can you can network them together and everything it's a fantastic machine needless to say so i'm very uh high on it but you said you have comp- Suns at work right what other machines do you all have at work
uh-huh
i see well tell them to look at the Amiga a lot of people think it's a toy and a game machine but it is a most powerful work station all the way around multitasking and i mean a real-time multitasking operating system and computer made
uh-huh
not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular TV set and you can do video presentations with it
it has all kinds of software you can use that Commodore makes called Amiga Vision so that you can take pictures in and then you can make up your own video presenta- Hewlett Packard uses it
Hewlett Packards makes PC's and they use the Amiga to do video presentations and um uh campaigns educational type uh presentations for the engineers in- incidentally Bausch and Lomb uses it too
sure
uh-huh
well what you would do in the case of the Amiga is you'd use NTSC output that you can get on the machine put it right out to a uh vi- video tape and just cut you a video tape by uh by running it
to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can be put right out of the back of the machine to a common VCR and recorded on a VHS tape
yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat
on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running
because you can put more than one frame into the machine
and then you can describe what's going on you can record it via microphoning machine then there's a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied satisfactory done you can then take it and play it back out of the machine right out the NTSC port in the back to a VCR and record it
after that you can put it all on floppy disk it might take several and between on how big a space you're talking about and uh carry it to another facility if they happen to own an Amiga well you slap it on there put it on their hard disk and away you go
for what to do it well the parts or the machines depending on wha- well you can get a two thousand which is uh a bare essential machine to do this with for about twenty three hundred dollars
and uh then you would uh with some add on options and things you'd have to have probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty five thirty six hundred dollars
if unless you want to use a video [vocalized-noise] to to do all kind of weird things like wipes and and fades and things like that which the uh TV people use
okay well if you don't need that which is really fancy and that has twenty four bit or sixteen million colors
if you don't need that that's another fifteen hundred dollars and that's made by a commercial company just for the Amiga IBM and Mac both tried to get them to make it for their machines but they can't because the Amiga's the only PC on the market that has special graphics and sound
and peripheral handling chips inside and that's why it can be a multitask operating system and not and handle num- multiple jobs at once because it has three co-processor chips in there that help out the main CPU and off load it from doing the graphics
see the CPU in my machine is a little old sixty eight thousand and it loafs because there's three co-processors chips in my machine to handle the graphics
uh the color graphics one co-processor chips handles all the sounds and it can make it has four channels of sound two of them come right out the back as stereo ports i have mine hooked up to my stereo down stairs has excellent stereo
dynamic range and it has a third chip in it that has all your peripherals so that if i were to copy a file from my hard disk to the floppy
then the CPU just goes out and tells Paula that's the chip that does peripheral handling copy this file from the hard disk to the floppy and the CPU goes off and does something else because
well what would you have at a dinner party
uh-huh [noise]
oh gosh that sounds great
uh-huh
well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish
because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my
guest but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um shrip shrimp fettucini is real easy
to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines
oh yeah um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them
dead i mean well you eat them dead but [laughter] right because if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out and you're not supposed to eat those because they're the bad for you
yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see o- i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it but um you just put some cajun well
lots of pepper and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can
plan on those being shot
i think for a dinner party i i don't know it depends like if like
my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um sh-
shell them or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head so um
it it would just depend that's the best part of the crawfish sucking the head but um
i don't know it just i- it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled an- everything and
usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um
you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but
um [noise] yeah it really does i like shrimp better
just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but um
i think that and also to get totally off c- the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps
[laughter] that's what i need [laughter]
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] oh
[laughter]
i bet that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe [laughter]
that would be fun
uh huh
sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something [laughter] well that's you know that's fun
uh huh
[laughter]
[noise] that sounds right i would i'd take him up on that
[laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum maybe [laughter] i that's about how much i can cook you know i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now
then i used to but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so i try to have things cooked for her but
uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen i don't know [laughter] not one of my favorite hobbies but
well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are just absolutely delicious i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but
[laughter] um
i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
oh
yeah
oh that would be wonderful
yeah
um-hum
oh
um-hum
well um how long do you cook the meatballs
uh huh
[noise] oh yeah
[noise] hum that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend that would be great
i'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties [laughter] because i like to i mean i'm
i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be um
[noise] you know i'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy
oh yeah i have to impress the boss [laughter] and clients because um i'm in i'm in public relations in school so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients an- stuff like that so
i'm gonna have lots of dinner parties and have to take them out to eat and
right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised properly but i'd been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know about
but um [noise] so
is there anything else
[laughter]
oh yes you need to try them oh they're wonderful
[laughter]
well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties but [laughter] when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time
uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatballs and it's made with r-
red wine and um it's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it that's one of my favorite things to to serve
sure
oh really well i guess being from that part of the country
uh-huh
yeah
well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish i in fact i just came back from the grocery store and being in Texas we don't have too many you know people that that eat
crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale
um-hum
[laughter] don't buy them that way [laughter]
uh-huh
okay well i'll remember that
uh-huh
uh-huh
when you were um whe- when you [noise] serve it do you shell them and then serve them to
um-hum
sure
[laughter] so they don't have see that [laughter]
ooh [laughter]
[laughter]
um-hum
does it taste a lot like shrimp
uh-huh
yeah
sure
yeah we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks
all the time and [laughter] yeah that's what i wish i had [laughter] but in our family i'm the one who who cooks and i i really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids but i really do enjoy cooking
and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would
cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and [laughter] we we was really a lot of fun and
yeah it did and we we tried to be
fancier or more courses than the other or uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be
ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know [laughter] it was a lot of fun
that's right [laughter]
it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh
make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm
it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh
make sure that they didn't have to do it again [laughter] make hot dogs or some potato chips or
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh that's nice
[laughter]
it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it
[laughter]
yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this [vocalized-noise] like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um
um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts [noise]
which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it
and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food
the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies and it gives it a bit of a different consistency
the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're
uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them
then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good
oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself
that's real good
right and then freeze them
sure
[laughter]
yeah
uh-huh
yeah you'll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work [laughter]
uh-huh
sure
oh really
[laughter]
[laughter]
well
i- i think we've we've covered the subject i've got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i was it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale
oh i will i'm sure my husband will be
surprised because we were talking about them the other day even before
well what is it that you prefer to provide as far as maintenance on your vehicle
wow
how about that
that i'm not quite as mechanically inclined although that some of the the basic things that you need to do for uh the maintenance of your warranty on a vehicle
i- is stuff that you can do yourself just the oil uh changed and things of that nature that's about where i my expertise ends in in that category just you know
um-hum
i believe that
boy i tell you i just got my car back from a dealer and when it was in there i had them just go ahead and change the oil and filter thirty four dollars
huh well that's uh that's quite a savings having that talent
how many miles there is that
[laughter] now what did you just replace
now i'm not even familiar with what that where that is
um-hum
um-hum
hm
sure
well how much how long did it take to replace that
uh-huh
oh sure
um-hum
how much would uh something like that cost in the garage
jimminy
and how much do you think the parts was by itself
oh really
wow
oh gosh
yeah fou- at a hundred dollars a night that's not still not too bad
sure
um-hum
right
exactly
w-
yeah well unfortunately i just had replaced the the power antenna uh you know it kind of dumb having the garage door i drove out before the door was completely up and the radio was on so it took off the antenna
but the mast itself cost uh thirty f- two dollars
and i went i called the dealer and they wanted two hundred and twenty to put it in
and
gosh and then i went to
well i- i i looked at it myself to see if i could do it myself because i you know i i feel i'm s- pretty competent and handy but un- unfortunately they buried this one in the sixty six Mazdas you have to remove the dash and the fuse box to get to the motor
and so they say there's uh three hours of labor just to uncover where the the metal shaft goes in because it goes through the through the door in between the windshield and the driver's side door and comes out above the driver's head
yeah so it's terribly engineered [laughter]
everything was visible
oh yeah
anymore just putting everything on a chip is your going to have to replace the chip unless you have the tools to diagnose what's the problem with the chip
but
i had a a seventy nine Mus- uh Mazda RX7
first year of the rotary engine that i used to do i used to work on because it you know heck seventy nine if i was to do something screw it up electrically uh i c- i handled everything i put in antennas there you know the power antenna the replacement parts all that kind of thing
but when it came to ever giving k- any kind of tune ups or things like that i'd take it into the shop anything basically with the yeah
yeah and they just stop making them now
so it's kind of interesting whe- it's work great smooth
i suppose but i had a hundred and twenty eight thousand on it when i sold it
yeah
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
wow
sure
sure
oh really
well that's good
sure
um-hum
right
sure sure of course
of course
um-hum
right
[laughter] well it seems like you've got a very valuable talent
oh great
hum yeah that's true well it's been good talking to you
[laughter] every once in a while down here at the main site [laughter]
oh it's been beautiful
there you go
starting to defrost
well that's great
we-
you too
a- alrighty good-bye
[noise]
i do all my own maintenance matter of fact i just finished putting a timing chain in my wife's Toyota [laughter] i do i do all of that myself
oh sure sure
well there's two things that drive that up here one is we is the lack of
good service people
because there just aren't are not any left hardly around up in this area
and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer
oh sure sure the the price is astronomical but what i do is
i like to do this okay and i and i i like to play with mechanics and that's i really i've done that all my life so
and the
the little the little Toyota is a nineteen eighty three so [laughter] i really don't have too much to lose if i mess it up too bad you know
the timing chain well the camshaft timing chain
okay it's in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump
and it it drives from the crankshaft it drives uh a chain that drives the camshaft which is an overhead cam in those foreign cars
and uh i- it was getting kind of worn the car has a hundred and one thousand miles on it and it was getting a little noisy so
not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the freeway and i didn't want to chance Irene driving the car like that so
i
oh three nights i worked on it three nights and about four hours on last Saturday and i just put it in the garage and worked on i- i ha- i have a new Oldsmobile so i really
uh i- it's it's just a little hobby and if it's not too cold outside and the weather's starting to get pretty nice so if it's not too too cold out i can go out work on it don't have heat in the garage or anything but
uh
well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars
between the gasket kit and the new distributor cap i put on and the new uh chain and the labor
well the parts to to me i spent twenty two dollars on the parts
yeah
so i really i really don't have heart burn at all with doing it myself over four nights tie i tied the car up if four days but we're fortunate we didn't need it
no i know but you know you you save the markup on the parts and of course you buy them whole sale from the parts store and and you can save a little bit there and you can save an awful lot on the labor which is high today like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do and
i d- i don't blame the garage people it's just that it's very very hard to find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work
all of our so called garages are now a convenience stores that sell gasoline and they really don't do any repairs anymore so you know you're you're you- you're almost tied to the dealer to go back to them and
well it seems like they're just swamped with work so
sure
sure
uh-huh
sure and that- that's held in by two bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no
i'm sure you could of
uh-huh
uh-huh
okay yeah that's one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah ok- yeah yeah
well that's that's another problem you know and if you don't have all these special tools of course like i said we're very fortunate with the older cars we can work on them what
um if you don't have all the special tools and the technology i i'd i would hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them
i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh
sure
uh-huh ye- that's absolutely true [noise]
uh have you done have you done much repair work yourself o- other than just routine maintenance like oil changes and stuff
yeah
sure
that rotary engine always fascinated me i wa- i was always enthralled by the rotary engine i think that's a neat idea and i'm surprised we haven't gone that way more and and
yep yep
it's a smooth running quiet car i i just i don't know why well perhaps the the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know
the uh the automotive industry is in dire needs of something in this in this country and it's too bad uh the Toyota we bought i i bought second hand i did not buy it new uh
but if you look at what's in that little car and as opposed to what's in some of the American cars you can see where we're probably a half a step behind and i think i think we're trying to do something to correct that but i think we got away from us a little bit so
but i- i i i just like i say to work on it myself i one i like to do that
uh i i think i would do all of the maintenance i change my own oil and i change of course spark plugs and stuff like that that's routine that i i would call routine maintenance once a year i do that every fall i get ready for the winter
and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal
but even today like with your waste oil when you drain the oil and change the oil now i have to bring it to a disposal center i c- i no longer can put it in in the trash you know or in a container yeah we have
we're we're really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the country and
a- and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England
so we have to take the oil to uh a uh a disposal center that's an EPA you know authorized disposal center
and they gladly take it but they only take it like for two hours on a Saturday morning you know and it's it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think it's still worth it in the long run
because oil you can buy for eighty five cents a quart but if you buy that same oil at a dealer it's going to cost you probably two dollars a quart
and uh and now the labor to put it in
and uh i i again i like to do that i i would do all the maintenance on my car if i could uh
you know e- even into major things just to keep our car longer because i don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them in two years or three years and of course i was never in a position where i could trade my car off every two years
uh well i i like i said i've done mechanics all my life and i do that with the company so uh i'm a senior engineer for them so i am mechanics and i i just uh i enjoy it i really it's like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it
if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and it's a diversion because i know i'd really don't have to do this okay so i think i like that because i know i don't have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation
uh it sure has i really appreciate your call and uh [laughter] it's nice to talk with you folks from from down in the in the main office area and
yeah sure how's your weather it's pretty good
yeah we're just starting to get some nice little warm weather up here in New England it got up to seventy today that's a good sign we we we've been running around twenty in the morning and getting real cold and it's too cold to work on automobiles outside generally but we had the last few days been pretty nice
i appreciate your call and you enjoy yourself if you're ever up this way look me up in Attenborough okay sir thank you again
[noise]
oh okay
oh
uh-huh
yeah
sure you ready
[noise]
okay
well it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to re- retire and when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now
i do i don't know we're either gonna buy a pick up or we're gonna buy a van
or we're gonna buy an economy car how do you like that
[laughter]
yeah
yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i'm hoping that by you know
that's like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now
but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features
well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it
and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises
um-hum
uh-huh
you got it i
i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door
well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that
i mean now i-
you probably would not
right
because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me
i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist
all these people were a- and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20/20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord
then they were like paraplegics
right
yeah
well tell me about your van do you like it
um-hum
[noise]
huh the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida
and like i said i mean we're not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire
and when he retires i'm retiring well as soon as i get my quarters in i'm retiring period that's it you know no more [laughter] and so
uh-huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more
i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one that's it
uh shoot i can't even think of the name of it now
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in
a what
a Ford Ford what you remember
he was trying to think of what the name of it was
this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then
the two swivel chairs on the front
and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but
i don't know i don't really
i don't i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van
well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was
yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that
uh-huh
yeah well see that's the reason that we couldn't make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it's unreal it's
you just practically don't get any
yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these
and another thing was that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along
when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn't get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn't get it period
oh that would be good
oh i think so too i don't think they should do away with the seat belts now i'm but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too
you know because i know so many people
here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around
but uh i think it's fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it
yeah
well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they're given like a ten year time limit
where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years
and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously
oh that's okay
okay
well you you too
[noise] all right bye bye
[noise]
uh no i think that maybe the the automation people that are
we're discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices
oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us
um hum okay it's a lot of fun
you want to punch the button and go
yep
[noise]
well are you going to buy a car soon
and what are you going to buy
well have you been listening to Iaccoca's arguments that uh that Chrysler products are the only ones that that all have airbags
does that make a difference to you
yeah like what
yeah
that's nice
did
did you see the uh i don't know if it was 20/20 last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts
did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out
and run over
that really sc- i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it
if if it it surely didn't come as a surprise that
that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and
um no probably well i'm not [vocalized-noise] the problem is i'm i'm really into cars and so it's not a uh
um for me it's it's a real it's a real consideration um
uh and and uh the but no i probably wouldn't have even though i'm really quite into cars it's it's probably my main hobby
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward
into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh par- i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat
you're better off not to have your seatbelt on if it's just a seatbelt we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness
i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh it's it's a mini van we've had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty
and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty um
the mini van it's actually we had a station wagon before and it's a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon
and it really um
we like it it the [vocalized-noise] interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van
yeah
yeah
which what kind was it
what what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World
uh actually i grew up in Alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know
four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it that's you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they're
uh my boss just bought a a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon
but it it has a big engine and it it pulls a boat and stuff but it's and it it's got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning
and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates
well the big you know the big vans are all real nice
yeah
oh those are
yeah
yeah
all right
they uh
well
well the mini the you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmobile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars
yeah
yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are are closer than they appear or something
yeah
well you you can you can uh install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high
and they really nice uh i'm on both sides actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back
but there
uh-huh
um-hum
uh
well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage
oh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah interesting enough Ford announced that i think in ninety two they're going to put uh air bags in their in their vans
so uh and i think i i believe safety i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh and i i think it's important [vocalized-noise] i'm not the air bags are a good deal but um
surprisingly uh they're uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh
and your seatbelt so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it would be interesting to see what that'd do to our insurance rates
you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesn't have air bags
would be interesting wouldn't it uh that wouldn't be fair but uh
yeah
yeah
uh i've got to go my son's in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes uh i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time
it was good talking to you okay good night
[noise]
okay
uh-huh
um-hum
[laughter]
uh-huh
[laughter]
oh
oh that's a good idea
uh-huh
oh
that'd be good
um i know we
i already have them thanks
um we're we are kind of getting into recycling now i'm in college and i live in a dorm and we recycle paper
and i know there's a glass plant up here and they recycle glass and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in and then we get money for that
[noise]
yeah we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm
well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff
or we play games like board games we buy board games you know it's just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy
um-hum
yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
oh
uh-huh
oh that'd be good
um-hum um
is that what this target is what you're
no
huh-uh
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh oh i was like [laughter] what's Target what's Target no um
there's i don't really know any other recycling that they do
no we no huh-uh we have to take it to a a recycling place
um-hum
oh
oh i didn't know that
um oh i never heard of that
um not that i know of [laughter] no
oh my gosh
hm
yeah uh we have places where we go and we what we do is we unload our cans it's like a conveyor belt and the belt um separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it
and then they weigh all your aluminum cans and then you get money for your aluminum cans
no but now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too
before they didn't but i know they're going to start now
[noise]
um-hum
[laughter]
yeah yeah uh-huh
yeah
well that's all i really know about recycling
oh really
we have Kroger but not a Skaggs
oh
huh [laughter]
you guys are getting into it more than we are
um-hum
huh-uh i've never seen any you know places that do i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back y- you know and use the ones that we have
you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones
yeah
yeah but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags
yeah [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
oh my
hum
i'm a finance major
oh [laughter]
oh really
um-hum
[laughter]
what do you think the outcome will be
yeah [laughter]
yeah oh yeah we've had one as long as i can remember [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um i can't think of anything on recycling [laughter]
[laughter] no
[noise]
what do we think about them
oh i don't [laughter] no i never really thought about it [laughter] i have no clue what you guys think about Pennsylvanians
oh really [laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter]
[laughter] i i don't know i really don't know anyone from Texas or anything
i've never been there hum-um
yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh well
oh [laughter]
oh
oh well is it like a foreign exchange type student
[noise]
well i just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow
but they were filled with beer cans and i hated to take a big old sack i mean we're talking you know like a lawn bag full of them like i no we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway
they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and i think that's all
oh
okay and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees
yeah and they've got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff
so they're getting into it i don't know what they get for the tickets though
what do you get for the tickets
if you bring stuff
oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets uh gets a party
so that's not bad yeah
um-hum
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that
ah that's really good
so
hm
for the dorm and who decides what you do with it
and what do they do with it
uh-huh
well
i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two
and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle anything of course you just threw it away
so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle i had my school do it
but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this
for the whole school you know it was just this big project she didn't want to get into that and i could do it in the center and i just never got around to it
but it's like a club you know about that
there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think and he was had started this um save the environment club
and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you don't have to join it as a group or anything i don't guess but you could start your own anyway get a a pamphlet
um-hum
do y'all have Target stores up there
no
that's a department store
kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells i think
[laughter]
we
so you're not pick- you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything yet
huh
now in some of the towns around us they're already picking up the newspapers
well they're doing that here too now that i think about it
once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string
and
i think that's all they're picking up but you know like in Minnesota they've got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles
yeah because w- my brother-in-law lives in Minnesota and they're just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up
so
do y'all have can banks
no
it's just a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you've got and you keep feeding it till the light goes off
and you get instant cash but they had one that i was putting my stuff in and i went to take some today and it was gone
[noise] i don't know but i i located another one today on the way to work
but they don't give you for the other
well that
uh-huh well they're certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i don't know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it
i don't know [noise]
i'm trying but [laughter] i just can't recycle everything just not that dedicated
but
me too if they would oh i know we're saving
our grocery bags now
yeah they're taking those up you can take them to the stores
um like Kroger's doing it
and i think Skaggs do you have those up there
and we they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic Coke bottles there too
so
pretty good isn't it
it sounds like it you'd think you would be
you mean where you sack your own groceries
huh and i don't want to go with those canvas bags right now i'm sorry i'm not that European [laughter]
[laughter]
but you know they do that like i went to Europe uh nineteen seventy three
and every you know they go all the time i mean it's like they would go almost everyday to the store and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators
that's why i mean they couldn't put anything in it hardly
but
well what are you going to be when you get out of college
well that's why i started what i did i think i went into teaching [laughter]
here in Texas it's a real mess right now
oh definitely there's no wh- let's see we've had the funding we've run out of money we've frozen the money
right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to dis- different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so
not as good an education right
and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable
and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts
[noise]
i think they're gonna uh maybe give us a state income tax do you have one
[laughter] we're not looking forward to it but something's got to be done
i mean
[laughter] well it's going to hit us
and i don't know
it did- doesn't seem like it would work to take it away when we're using it but maybe i know we're not using it so wisely
we have too many administrators
in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about
me either anything else
what about people from uh Pennsylvania what do they think about Texans
um-hum
[laughter] have you thought about that
[laughter]
[laughter]
um
probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here
i would hope so i mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have [laughter]
there's some
no
well i've never let's see i think i have too been to Pennsylvania
Gettysburg
yeah we went up there
now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on
she'd be big i don't know what are you saying Holly
oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language
Israel is what you say it is Holly Israel in Israel see she's got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she's befriended
so she's into this
huh-uh you know we've had a lot of the Jewish uh people
well ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle
yeah so
that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway
[laughter] do you do anything on a regular basis
yeah that's a good yeah my husband's a TIer in the house unit here
do you when you go to the Texans i have to ask you and if this is getting to [vocalized-noise] we're not supposed to get too particular but i'm just curious
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of there's so much it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera
uh-huh
yeah it- well it's not that great and i go to the Spring Creek one on and off but my husband's working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one but i just don't i mean i just it's so much weight lifting even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it
or is that what your into or
uh-huh
yeah
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there
and the pool when it gets warmer
yeah [laughter] i know well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class
in a a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas and
long story short i hadn't this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had like about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand
in any class like that i go to instead of having that level you know
they had a chrome strip that wasn't level and it was about four inches deep and then about a oh a seventy degree angle
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it
[vocalized-noise] the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped [laughter]
i know we went to uh HDA we- well whatever HDA Plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show
[laughter] and the doctor said you didn't do anything there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was Tuesday night and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist
so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it
yeah for about four weeks
so i mean i like aerobics but i'm not so sure [vocalized-noise]
no i've never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had but i've never i'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking and
and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basket- how many people come in here with things like that because they are active
you know i was real embarrassed but i felt kind of stupid
yeah they do i mean i guess i'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could say
because i got up and started jumping on it again
yeah really so i enjoy aerobics and i do it because i like it i mean i like the music and
that kind of stuff
oh
that makes my foot how'd you do that in aerobics
oh goodness
uh-huh
what'd they do for that did they have to cast it an-
oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good
oh goodness
uh-huh
oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing te- little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all
yeah it's been [vocalized-noise]
that's probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things
i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro- coronary
and there was my ego when i went ahead and i went oh i can do that and
half the time though i don't um jump half as much as i mean i'm like i'm real tall and you know i'm i'm not heavy but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i'm five eleven
you know you just take it easy um but when i see some wo- i mean so- and i just don't think it's healthy all that pounding all the time
so yeah that's the other reason and
i don't know this was just i guess something freak that happened to me because i wasn't fa- familiar with the um
oh it was completely i mean it literally the two dissimilar floor lev- floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened i thought maybe that's a handicap access and then i said no [laughter] that's just the way it's constructed
and my husband being a TI engineer i said i said a few things to him when i got home i said who has engineered that
[laughter]
but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot
do you like that what'd that voice say do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to
that's how i am yeah
if i don't do it i just feel like i don't have as much energy
right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff
[laughter] yeah but
that gravity factor i know [laughter]
like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry Diane he says he said uh you're at thirty something but you're on the upper side he said that uh don't worry he says even if you weren't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you
yeah because i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy i'm not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being
i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature [laughter]
and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things and they're all like twenty one years of age
but luckily at Texans there's a little more diver- diverse clientele
except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate
there's
yeah there some things i'd like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what
uh-huh
i don't think i've ever i think i've that there was some girl there i've been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to
it's terrible it's i don't know if the Dallas location it just seems that um sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar
no i haven't either and i just uh it's not that far of a drive and i'm glad they did that um you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site it's not
at all anything worth talking about
yeah but if you don't live near there that's not worth
we
yeah that's that's actually where this happened to me out in i say Plano but it's all the same to me Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a uh new recreation center
and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities [laughter] to play basketball waiting ar- for us and as we walked out i was limping and i'm like oh great i have purple tights on you know
and they're going yes but in general i like to exer- i i like dance a lot so i mean i aerobics is something i'd hate to give up but
he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or
[vocalized-noise] he told me eight to twelve weeks not anything you know i said but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but
that's just [vocalized-noise] they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm but i just the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed i couldn't you know
adjust that well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then
no well you're walking okay now obviously and you can
[laughter] so you're still able to walk yeah
well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about
yeah me too me too i need to go actually get something to eat here [laughter]
okay thank you Sandy
uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
oh no
awe
exercise is not supposed to do that to you
uh-huh [laughter]
well i i off and on off and on right now i've been off off
but um i've been going over to the fitness center
yeah three times
yeah three uh-huh well i try to go over there at least three times a week and i try to walk um at least five times a week
uh-huh
yeah uh well i've been going to Spring Creek i haven't been to the Dallas one now in oh a couple of years ye- well at least since they've redone it supposedly redone
so i don't really know what
yeah
yeah that's true
no no well i've i've used the the Nautilus equipment and the the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly i don't use the free weights but
yeah i like those too and the pool yeah that's great [laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my goodness
um
uh-huh
woo
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
um
put a big cast on it
four weeks yeah
[vocalized-noise] not that much though
yeah
[laughter] well those things happen though
yeah
[laughter] well that would that did a lot of good i'm sure
yeah
i like the music but i've been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago i broke my heel
and uh so
[laughter] no no actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off [laughter] leaned the wrong way
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete
yeah they had well they had to go in and do surgery they put a pin in it
yeah
yeah that [vocalized-noise] cause i permanently damaged the the uh cushion under my heel you know the the normal cushion that you have there so
i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt
uh well i haven't tried that i don't know it's been i bet -s it's been [laughter] thirty years since i played tennis
but um mostly into just walking and stuff like that
uh-huh
ye- [laughter]
uh-huh [noise]
uh-hum uh-hum
oh
sure
it isn't really it's not really good for your knees
uh-hum
well the floor was uneven you know [noise]
sure
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
really [laughter]
uh-huh yeah i like swimming uh-huh
uh no i like i like it because i i want to it makes me feel better
yeah
uh-huh i mean it's real funny because if you you know it just seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired but it's the other way around
uh-huh yeah really
[laughter] and i need all the help i can get
uh-hum uh-huh it does get you [laughter]
[laughter] but thanks a lot
uh-huh
[laughter]
[laughter] no [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
uh-hum
[laughter] that's true they do
they do
yeah i try try to go real late or real early before they get there [laughter]
uh-huh
that's one thing i like about the Spring Creek place uh at least the fellow that's there one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful
and his name is B J
and
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah yeah that's true ye- i and i haven't haven't noticed that up at Spring Creek
yeah i thought maybe one of these days i'll drive over there and check it out but
yeah i live in Richardson but it's about half way between the Spring Creek and the and the Dallas site so
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah [vocalized-noise] probably will for a while because it
it's going to be real tender when they
uh-huh
yeah i know what you mean
yeah it's not fun [laughter]
oh yeah i i have a slight limp from it but it matches one if i have one on the other side [laughter]
yeah [laughter] yeah you know
[laughter]
well other than i need to go you know more [laughter]
i need go more but it's great though i really do enjoy it
sure thanks then
bye-bye
[noise]
[noise]
well i don't know i've i've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch TV about the different uh things that are happening i uh i'm against it but on the same token um i went out and purchased a gun just because i
wanted the right to do that [laughter] so i i have a rifle in the house um the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it but uh
i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon
uh how do you feel about it
hm
uh-huh
[laughter]
uh-huh
well up uh up in New England where i'm from uh y- you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammn-t- amm- ammunition
and i thought that was really good and i think it they uh takes two weeks for that system to process um your request for uh
not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition you have to get a p- permit from the police station in your local area to do that
yeah um
[noise]
i i i agree i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh [vocalized-noise] to
to stop the impulse buyer from um buying it quickly and and um maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it but if someone's really determined to to pick up a firearm uh you can pick it up anyplace and you can get them really cheap
uh-huh
how long was the waiting period out there [noise]
ah that wasn't too too bad
because i- if you're gonna go buy something um of of that nature i think you've you're gonna have some idea as to what you're gonna do with it you're not gonna react that quickly in other words you know you -on't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
yeah i do too uh because it doesn't make any difference uh uh whether it's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose they both do the same kind of job
uh yeah i suppose i'd never got shot with either one but i don't know um i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
yeah
uh-huh
oh
uh [noise] i've got a a manual singled shot and i guess it doesn't have any any automatic features to it the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
it's got a hell of a kick to it
[laughter]
do you belong to a gun club or you uh
um-hum
no kidding
huh well the the um uh clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive but uh it's well worth it you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and so- targets and have uh competition
um i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire uh there's an annual membership fee
uh that's that's fairly high plus there's initi- initiation fee that you have to pay as a first time uh uh member
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars just to join the club plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
uh-huh
i think the the gun clubs serve a useful purpose in fact i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
[laughter] and you know it it even a- after you wait your nine days if you don't know how to hand- it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive and you give him a license because he waited nine days
he could he could not only um uh shoot himself he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it
wow he was fortunate he could he could of hit something else [laughter]
wow
[laughter]
how about uh private citizens selling uh weapons like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
huh how do you feel about that do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the um buyer and the seller and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it
[noise]
yeah but is- isn't there a way to um to deregister yourself after you register a gun
because i
have
yeah is it registered
the um the rifle that i've got is not registered and um i don't know why i never registered it but the uh
[noise] um i'd i'd i think it's it's voluntary [noise] the um the
yeah
[laughter]
yeah i guess that could happen it's just like the uh the social security system once they uh they gave everybody a number and now they're making you um uh get one at at birth
and once they have your number they have you know your identification and if you try to to do anything um like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are [noise]
and that's true [laughter]
that's all right yeah you were talking about uh um fed- what the federal government knows about people
[laughter] they probably do
yeah
uh-huh
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered
no i don't either i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to just you know put up the money
uh-huh
[noise] [noise]
yeah
and there's there's no waiting period on that
[laughter]
you sell the refrigerator yeah
hm yeah i think the federal government is um is really far away from uh [noise]
um control i i don't believe in um should i shouldn't probably say control i mean regulation control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have b- um but i would like to see them have [noise] a monitoring capability
so that they know who has what weapons
yeah [noise]
[laughter] unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money so i can't complain too much [noise]
uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control
well i think uh down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns
and i think they need that uh now i do have a i have a pistol it's a little twenty two and i have a twenty two or a twelve gauge shotgun
and you know i do like to have my guns uh i don't know if i'll ever use it
you know and like you my bullets to my little pistol's probably uh about three years old [noise] uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
but uh i like to have them where handy [noise]
[noise]
[noise] i've never heard of anything like that that would be nice but a- you know the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other
yeah
i know i- i uh th- i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh Tennessee and uh they had a waiting period and uh
we bought it there and
about nine days
no [noise] no
yeah somebody want do th- i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
[noise] shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
a shotgun's got too much of a spread or at least ours does uh it you know you have a little uh
thing on the bo- bottom of th- on top of the barrel where you a- you turn it you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get and the spread changes
[noise] yeah
yeah my husband had a uh
a police gun at one time and i shot that thing one time almost knocked me down it was just a little [noise] i don- i forget i think it was a three fifty seven i'm not sure
he belonged to one awhile back
uh since we mo- we've only been here in Texas for about a year [vocalized-noise] uh we can't even find a place to shoot just for target practice
but i'd love to get used to that shotgun we traded his pistol for that shotgun
yeah well that's what uh my husband wh- when he was in it gun club when they's done that it you know he went mostly just to um shoot at paper targets
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that
that's a good i've never thought of that that's a good point
yeah that and yeah
and well we uh we was living on a Navy base down in Memphis and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
[laughter]
[noise] well [noise] he went tumbling down the steps along with
uh shooting his foot almost off he broke his leg and a collar bone and couple of other things i'm sure being mister cowboy i can't remember what the na- term was going around it was about four to five years ago [noise] but [noise]
naw th- i guess that would be a good idea [noise]
[noise]
uh that's a hard one because we did that but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it i'll uh
you know the person who sells the gun ought to protect themself because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something [noise] the cops are gonna come to you [noise]
ah [noise] i have no idea
i've only had one gun and i've kept it you know uh the one gun that was in my name
yeah
i don't think you have to register a shotgun
well see uh my husband has a thing if they go to
uh regulating uh [noise] all right uh banning guns o- pri- private pri- private ci- citizens this my kid is jumping on me i can't hardly talk [noise] um
my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns
[noise]
[noise] yeah
and everything about you
uh i [vocalized-noise] bu- you know they know it from how much money you make a week to uh
probably [noise]
your uh [noise] my kid is banging i was seeing what they was banging on uh i've lost my train of thought i'm sorry [laughter]
oh the social [noise] yeah they pr- they probably know everything from half the time wh- ho- what time you go to the bathroom
no that's that's a little bits extreme but they could know anything and everything about you and uh i'd like to have my gun if they go to banding banning them
i'd lose my gun but we wouldn't lose our pis- or ou- shotgun and uh we're wanting to get a couple more [noise] that no one knows about but [noise] i don't i don't uh
naw
yeah w-
yes well you can look in the uh the we got the thing down here called a shopper
it's a a who a it's a it's a bargain thing uh you go and everyb- you know i always see guns in there five to seven guns a day it comes out every Tuesday
naw none whatsoever you ca- call [noise] w- we sold a refrigerator through it and it took us all of twelve hours
yeah you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun [noise]
[noise] yeah well i'll agree with you there they do have too much control over us already uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
[laughter]
yeah i guess so
i don't know they're [noise]
[noise]
okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess
[laughter] obviously you have kids
i haven't seen that one yet
um i s- the last movie i saw was uh Sleeping With The Enemy and i uh see i'm not a big Julie Roberts fan um but i was a lot
i wa- i was a lot more [vocalized-noise] uh impressed with her than i thought i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie
i i'm ready to go it just uh it's you know hasn't worked out that way yet but um you know it's uh it looks good you know
if you like thrillers anyway [laughter] in fact uh people that i've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards so [laughter] so
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well what other movies have you seen then lately
other than the i assume you were talking about the new Ninja Turtles movie
is that any good i mean i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because i'm going in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one so i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon
oh well then it won't be too bad i mean i was you know it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been
yeah
right right yeah i think that's important if you're you know if you're going to you know kids are going to or parents are gonna have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know
semi for them too so yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter] was about to say you're not going to take her to that one i'm sure do you take her or do you go [vocalized-noise] to a lot of uh like comedy movies or to
what was the last comedy you saw
[laughter]
the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong um the last movie i saw was The Hard Way with uh Michael J Fox well that really wasn't too bad it
there were you know he's supposed you know he's this actor right and he's he's playing a a cop well he's he's he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop
you know what i mean there there were times when he was like you know he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because
you know you y- oh yeah because i mean yeah because i everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and and uh you know i thought he did such an excellent job of not
going that far now you know at the by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was he was trying to you know trying to get it but he wasn't there yet but you could tell
like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um James Woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah
yeah and there were there were some definite um [noise] uh should i say tense moments with him in there so
yes i i i had seen it before Christmas but i took a uh a date to it uh about a month ago so i i i've seen it the second time not too long ago so
i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh
uh the the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over again but before i- maybe it's just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse
i mean you know i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it i mean it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time i don't know but
yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie [noise]
[laughter] i love those movies
oh yeah
well you have to see them more than that i mean you know i- i still catch things in Airplane that i didn't catch i mean
it's its amazing i love those movies i really do
yeah
[laughter] oh yeah
uh-huh
oh isn't it though you know but that's at least the good thing about
you know the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper but [vocalized-noise] yeah that's exactly what i was going to say i keep i keep not doing it until after i'm there and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things
easily yeah yeah and that's and then you know if you want popcorn and stuff it's just i mean uh it's incredible
no no it's nowhere near that expensive
[vocalized-noise] and it it's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style i mean it's as simple as that
yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie
[laughter] no don't don't that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling
of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean
you know [vocalized-noise] i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but i'm glad i didn't i really and truly am i mean it that mov- that was one movie i came out impressed
i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars none at all i mean i'm normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one one movie taking all the honors i i wanted him to win best
best actor on top of it i mean it was just he was like i said he was now i wouldn't have i wouldn't given the supporting actress or actresses either one but the uh you know even though they were okay the girl in it
uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i'd say yeah i can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know
it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldn't have done it now the best the supporting actor he was good
but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh
oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um it's it's
okay no problems it it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so there's you know there's
yeah but well
and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean
part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they don't stress that very much they really don't and i think it's an excellent movie for if if she enjoys
movies i think it'll work pretty good yeah
it's it's it's a long movie
oh yeah
i may have to see the video i hadn't even thought of that
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
because i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things
oh i do too
yeah but not enough yeah i'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch Nick at Nite
[noise]
um [noise]
a lot well the last movie i saw but it wasn't my choice was the Ninja Turtle movie [laughter]
that's right yeah but uh my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs
that's an excellent movie
oh was that good i heard
oh okay
well that's good
yeah
that's uh Silence of the Lambs kept me on the edge of my seat
right
yeah it is right and i do i-
oh really oh i love them like that i'm not i mean i i like all ranges of movies but
i like that where they're real intense i really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time it's really it's real it was really interesting
oh
yes the new one of course [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
oh it really was i didn't see it the first one my husband said it was um about the same lines
so yes
right right and um i was i was impressed with the fact that um
it wasn't that childish you know what i mean it wasn't my daughter's five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated and uh
she really enjoyed it but but it was on a on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did and i liked that
right
[laughter] that's right that's right and it it's pretty good but we take we take her to just about
every movie and she uh she does really good we've taken her from real young and she does real good like i said we don't take her to R's so [noise] if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with Silence of the Lambs we go see it [laughter]
no no no
yeah yeah um
oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw huh huh huh good question [laughter] good question we don't get to go that often but i'm
something on the tip of my tongue and i can't think of which one it was um [noise]
gosh i can't remember i
uh-huh
but that that sounds that sounds good
uh-huh
right
oh okay
uh-huh
that's neat cause that the part was hard to to do that
right
yeah
right
yeah
right
uh-huh
yeah i like him
[laughter] probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is Home Alone
yeah
uh-huh
it was really cute [laughter]
[noise]
yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah
right
yeah maybe so maybe so
yeah i did too i'm looking forward to this summer uh Naked Gun Two and a Half is coming out
i do too i mean they are just slapstick and it's just you have to see those twice to catch everything
yeah yeah those
yeah i do too
i do too so i'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do but well we [noise] we try to go
a couple of times a month i guess to see a movie it it's just getting so expensive
right but normally we don't think about it until [laughter] right
i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just the just getting in the three of us
[vocalized-noise]
i don't understand why they ch- they [vocalized-noise] they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive when you buy yeah and so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and Coke
[vocalized-noise] we just keep breeding them that way
i guess so now have you seen Dances With Wolves
did you love it
i haven't seen we're waiting for the video
[laughter] no really
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh really oh
really
uh-huh
that's good
i heard that yeah yeah
yeah oh
yeah
oh gosh [laughter] yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
do you think my daughter would like it
or just
oh okay she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes [laughter]
see that's the one that is the honest to God the one reason i don't want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason [laughter] and i know they're fake
okay okay
oh that'll be good yeah we we really need some my husband keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the video's even going to be longer they're gonna put in a lot of stuff that they cut out
yeah that's [laughter] that's true they said yeah they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length
and that they wanted in so they're going to put it in the video and that way you can watch it at your leisure so
yeah that's true
yeah yeah
true
yeah
i know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot [laughter]
yeah we keep holding out you know
[vocalized-noise]
yeah [vocalized-noise]
well i can understand that it's it's that time of the year uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house so we're
spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess
in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago i've my TV viewing has started to tend more towards uh
documentary news programs things like that something that's going to keep me up to date i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh
um-hum
yeah that makes a big difference
okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that
i- i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on TV because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two [laughter] you feel kind of left out but um
um-hum
i believe that
um-hum um-hum
yeah [noise]
that's right
yeah
well i- i know exactly how you feel
that's right i- i uh
when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh
i guess i- i sort of kind of became n-
numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um
to network TV again once in a while right now we don't have cable and it's surprising how much it's changed the you know the the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different
and uh w- we don't have any kids yet but uh i i- i- i feel the same way it's really tough to find something
that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um y- you know you [laughter] you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and
kids kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh
right right
oh yes yeah
that's right
that's right
well that's true
uh-huh
that's [laughter] i'm glad you said it and i didn't have to but that that that's the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show ah it's you know why do you do this to yourself
yeah [laughter]
okay yeah
right
now there's an idea
um okay yeah
yeah yeah that's that's pretty good
i i can't handle it very long [laughter] i i mean i'm i'm a i'm a sports fan but uh i- it's
well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more if if half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad but uh it it's you're missing an awful lot i'd rather personally rather watch
see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but uh but uh no i don't sit down i'll i'll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship
you know things like that but i don't i don't follow any team i i i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me
but uh i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while
well
no we don't yeah
yeah
right
uh-huh
that works you bet yeah
yeah no i don't know if there's any any series or anything that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while
yeah it is in fact it's i think it's on tonight [laughter] i just got in from outside so i so i'm kind of
out of it th- things like that and i i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know and uh
you can tell they they they pick up the words every once in a while [vocalized-noise]
yeah
i try to
yeah [laughter] if
well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think it's come around again it's gone through cycles but uh
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
right
[laughter] that's for sure [laughter] that is for sure
well i guess there's a few things around still but uh
yeah sounds like we pretty much agree
well
its been uh good talking to you
okay
you too bye
[noise]
well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything i'm going to say is kind of dated [laughter]
yeah
oh
yeah yeah
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum
oh yeah i think when you're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week
so so yeah i- i used to when my kids were real little and i was home i watched uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last thing i watched regularly was Thirty Something when it first came out did y'all ever watch that
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeah right right
i know but i'll tell you what um we're really strict with our kids about television and one night a couple of weeks ago
it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it
and so we you know and it was prime time it was what seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night and n- we have cable and there wasn't anything on any channel and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know ABC NBC CBS
was it was just um dribble
do you know i mean it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative it it was the worst i've seen i mean i have not watched prime time week night TV i guess in a real long time [laughter] because i was shocked i- i just
you know what i'm saying
um-hum
[laughter]
right
right
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
right
right
oh [laughter]
yeah
right
right
it's just it's just an [noise] like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know
but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but it's just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're
if you're in the room so but it's such a shame because it could be so good i- i don't understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that
you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i ca- it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and
you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's IQ has dropped dramatically [laughter] or something
[laughter]
[laughter] i know why do you do this
i know [vocalized-noise] i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you know i do like i like um stuff that's on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that
stuff i guess that's mostly public on public TV stuff as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid [noise] excuse me my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular TV that we watched we had to watch an hour of public TV [laughter]
[laughter] that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on What's New or there was some other the children's program i think at the time was called What's New so we had to give a little oral report before we could
watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan
yeah [laughter] yeah
uh-huh
um-hum
right yeah
yeah
yeah that's true the traffic um [noise]
yeah yeah
um-hum
um-hum yeah
yeah
yeah i- i enjoy that but what do you where do you [noise]
oh do you get the co- you don't have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials and then you're
you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up you know what i did [vocalized-noise] there was a time there where i could um tape things and then i'd fast forward through the [laughter] commercials saved a lot of time that way
[vocalized-noise] but that takes too much planning
um
now that yeah is that still real good it used to be real good is it
oh [laughter]
oh okay
yeah
yeah yeah
right
right right isn't it su- such a long running
program yeah they do have a good they do have good writers for that oh that makes me think do you watch Saturday Night Live at all
yeah we try to stay up too [laughter]
[laughter] it's getting harder and harder ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up to watch it
[laughter]
yeah
right
yeah
yeah it was it we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again
but it's a real different show than it was when it started it's it's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be but you can't be uh so um you can't be outrageous
[vocalized-noise] you know if you keep that same format there's only so long that you can be outrageous so
so
yeah you have to hunt hard for them i guess
yeah i guess so
well
yeah good talking to you
take care bye
[noise]
are are you a uh a TIer
oh really
oh yeah
oh yeah yeah i- i- in fact with me uh this is uh it's not much to talk about i i'm so
much for it i don't really have much to comment about it uh there's been some interesting subjects that they've ca- how many times have you called or have you been participating in this uh
oh you got ten well you you've passed me up this is about six times
yeah
no i think it's good in fact uh i don't know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it
so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down
i think
yeah a- as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug use- but i think that uh i was well you ha- when i was at TI of course we had all the information before they started
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rela rehabilitation programs and i think that's what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program
uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits o- of rehabilitation and everything so
yeah our our numbers have been way down i don't know what they were
yeah
oh really
oh yeah you're that's a good point but at TI they before they had the testing i've forgotten i- s- seems like it's a year ago September something like that
they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government and and that of course that's critical just as the point that you're brought up that
whoever does your testing -s got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything they don't make mistakes that would be terribly embarrassing
for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i haven't heard of any now i'm not in personnel or anything
but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they're not you know in other words there's very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it's got to be
if you have a drug testing program it's got to be with a very very good agency you don't just have you know some local uh group do it it's got to be a a a highly qualified agency
no you don't want to do that it's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group
a- and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing it's got to be with a
you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn't even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah
oh no no they're not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh
and they have uh a lot of uh th- they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever
and so they they they they don't no it's not firing first it's uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate in fact they
again before you go you know tha- that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs
go ahead and and get rehabilitated first and and and they won't even say anything about it you know
oh sure
oh yeah no that that's not right it's really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is you know it's a weakness and all and wh- who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another and i think that uh
those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers
give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i don't know i don't even have that much knowledge to know
whether that would uh get them addicted or not you know tha- that's a real worry
oh you know a lot about it then yeah
no
[noise]
yeah
yeah i know i i'm glad of that and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far [vocalized-noise] [noise] know they're not on it that's my [vocalized-noise] phone i i i have one daughter still at home one's at UT and one's at home gets dozens of calls a night
uh no no no no no i i i don't care about that tha- tha- she she'll be on the phone all night yeah
right
do you have children
oh well great oh fan- fantastic experience i've got two as i said i've got one in at UT now in Austin [noise] and one at home and uh i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them
it's a uh fantastic experi- you ca-
oh yeah y-
yeah
[noise]
the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time
so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and
and then you can kind of keep an [noise] you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know
we- well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my e- was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh they're very cheap until they get get to start driving
and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but
you wait until they go and get a car [noise] insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older you know uh i- i-
th- they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons [noise] [noise] but uh it's well worth it and everything
be great it's a great experience really you still there okay i thought that was cut off there but
well good you know i don't have much to say about drug testing uh
so you you've done this ten times
okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all that
oh okay well i i didn't know what they're they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know
so many calls will be some- a prize and everything
well that's great well what kind of cash i've forgotten what were they going to do
was it five dollars a call or something well hope i hope they follow through and everything
right yeah well right
right bye-bye now
uh no no i work there as a temporary
but are you at TI
so you have to do the random drug testing
oh about ten ten or eleven calls
yeah
uh um as contract person we have to do random drug testing too so
it doesn't bother me i don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything
as far as the number of drug users you mean or peop- huh
right
right yeah so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee
oh when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person and so we had when we sent temporaries to TI we had to have them drug tested and we did have a couple of cases where we really
the person said that they hadn't used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didn't retest them but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative
the second time so that that's the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem
right
yeah
right yeah not just some doctor's office somewhere
oh really
huh do you do they um have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive or do they fire them right away or
right
right i think that's really good i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something
right
yeah some of the stories you read about cocaine that's like people try it one time and they're addicted my husband is a counselor and he works with uh mostly with adolescents
so yeah i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that but most of the time it's
they get into a wrong crowd first and then they start a drug problem
it's usually not a one time accidental thing i don't think
yeah
oh
well i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that [vocalized-noise]
[laughter] um yeah uh it seems like just if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather
no not yet we're expecting a baby in July so we're starting [laughter] from yeah
yeah
yeah
oh we're really excited about it
you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a Saturday morning if they've been out at a party Friday night and
you're not too sure what's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked
right
uh-huh yeah i think that's a really good thing to encourage
[laughter] right [laughter]
oh well thanks
uh-huh
y- yeah
gets worse
[laughter]
yeah uh yeah i think it'll be neat
yeah yeah
yep i'm still here
well i can't think of no i can't think of anything else to say about that either
yeah
uh no i i don't work for TI so i get cash [laughter]
right yeah there's yeah
hum
yeah five dollars a call
yeah well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them so i guess we better get off [laughter]
it was good talking to you bye
[noise]
exercise tends to be a a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program i uh
oh i guess all the factors that drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some some uh need for reduction of weight or whatever
and i haven't uh been cursed or blessed with either depending on the way you look at it
um i've always been a physique that can stay skinny no matter what i eat or how much i eat or if i
uh exercise or not and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday uh
well maybe that'll maybe that'll allow me to to outweigh some of the things i have to pick up on occasion [laughter]
when uh i got married i was working a summer in college in construction and lost lot of what little weight i had
i got married at a hundred and thirty pounds and twenty years old and i was just this little toothpick up there had to buy a new suit for it just to fit in there
and it took me a good ten years to put on some weight and any exercise even when summer would come and i'd mow the lawn i'd lose five to seven pounds just just as soon as the heat kicked in
and finally at around age thirty i i managed to keep some weight and not lose so much during the summer and i hover at a hundred fifty and i'm six one so
it's not too bad i- it it's unfortunate though i guess because i probably should uh do a little less of the hardening of the arteries with the salt and a little less of the sugar here and there but
[noise]
yeah a lot a lot of people uh my brother in laws are all everybody is bigger than me for the most part
but uh it's kind of nice it's uh i- i've noticed a little bit uh of uh love handles here and there and my face has filled out a little bit from the pictures but uh
all that is is ever so slowly so
but then my father's uh sixty five years old and he's he doesn't show any signs of having to cut back either so there's hope for me maybe i'll maybe i'll maintain that
[vocalized-noise]
uh
um-hum
right
yep
huh
good
right
right
right
yeah well i've i've managed to
i guess the work i do gives me a little bit of well a lot of walking and a little bit of uh lifting on occasion
it's not all sitting behind a desk so that's kind of nice it uh
[noise] i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to
to uh working a steady you know eight hour job as it were i had been working for a camp and had had rela- real long hour you know a sixteen years old and could handle getting up at five and not getting to bed until ten or eleven and
virtually working or or playing myself to death all day
and uh boy after a few years of sitting down and then going to that that camp as a camper this time i couldn't even do what i used to do [laughter]
and it was really a a an eye opener for me to see that uh even sitting down for a little while sure changes the old body's uh capacity or
um
goodness
right
uh-huh
yeah my kids and i like to bicycle i tend to be rather sore the next day or two
those uh ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that i sit on
but uh they tend to like the parking lot up at the uh Springcreek Plant the upper limit of it's terraced and its usually unoccupied and
boy you can just you go down hill down hill down hill then turn around and work your way back up and uh
it's fun for them we take the long route go up Alma and across the back way come in the parking lot and
it takes a couple of hours off the day
but uh after all that and i usually end up having to by the end of the day they're usually tired enough where one of them or the other needs a little push along the way and i'm sitting here trying to go my bike and push them too and
and uh it gets to the old leg muscles but
can't do too much of that or i'll waste away
i sat down to uh one of the the nurses did the um [vocalized-noise] oh they do that blood deal oh
no it was just one of the what is that pulse no not the pulse they put on
blood pressure yeah they sit there in the cafeteria sometimes and take that on your way out
and after having sat for twenty or thirty minutes and i get up and walk over to that and sat down and they they took it it was pretty low like it usually is it it stays real
i guess all the arteries are open and it doesn't have any trouble pumping it all through but uh
the lady looked up at me and said oh you must be a jogger and i said oh if you only knew [laughter] couch potato with remote control
uh so fortunately i don't know what the cholesterol level is but at least it hasn't clogged up yet
yeah
hm
uh-huh
right
[noise]
[noise]
right
[laughter]
yeah
well they say your metabolism slows with uh six percent with every ten years of your life or something like that
[laughter]
yeah
whoa [laughter]
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
wow
yeah
yeah
well to give it give you some perspective my brother's six two and weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
hum
yeah
that's great [laughter]
well i know in in my family um my father has always been uh an exercise fanatic in fact uh he's from um Austria
and he came to this country and one of his first jobs was to teach gymnastics
and uh he use to make a living for a while doing gymnastics and swimming and in fact in Austria that was what he did for a living too but
uh of course you know he came over here uh i don't know fifty years ago or something like that
he um i- it of course it was much more prevalent in Europe exercise was much more taken much more seriously than it was here in fact
it it hasn't it's just now getting to the level where it was in Europe you know now with everybody is going to the health clubs and everything
um h- he keeps saying that he was too early he came too early
but um
he and b- the i- irony is that i've been overweight all my life and uh he uh he almost discouraged uh my brother and i from getting involved in athletics
um
because he felt that uh we needed to concentrate on on other things more important things in life uh but now and and he's still he's still into athletics in fact uh he's eighty two
and he is in the senior olympics every year and he always brings home silver and gold medals and he competes against people uh as much as thirty years younger than he is
uh and he still wins these silver and gold medals
uh
but i'm at the point right now where i have uh some concern my mother has a history of heart problems for herself and and her family my father had phlebitis
and um i'm i'm realizing that i need to do something uh or you know i'm going to suffer for it if i don't especially where i'm i'm i'm about thirty pounds overweight
and so i've started an exercise program i'm i'm sometimes i'm a lot more
diligent than others but uh i work a fellow i work with is a weight lifter and he's he's uh
he's competed and he's uh helped me develop a pretty simple program that involves some weights and and and some aerobics
and really with the design not towards being a body builder not towards being you know Mister America but but purely uh uh geared towards being being healthy
and uh and i'm i'm at the point where i've got three young children i really don't want to have to have
problems with uh um you know my heart or or or anything like that
that's good
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
yeah
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
oh yeah well i- i- i've i have a desk job i don't i you know i don't uh have an opportunity to walk around all that much uh unless i take it
uh and it's but it's gotten better i mean uh for many years i lived in the uh i lived in New Hampshire and i'd commute to uh Boston every day
so i'd end up sitting in the car for an hour and a half and then i you know and and a lot of it in car fumes you know inhaling car fumes
and then i'd sit at a desk for you know eight hours and then sit in the car for another ha- an hour and a ha- hour and a half
now that i've moved to Texas and i work ten minutes away um
i have a lot more free time to take walks with the family and or go bicycling bicycling or play basketball or baseball with my son and uh
uh it just uh it from that standpoint uh leaving that area was a was w- tu- turn around was good for my health i guess you could say
[laughter]
yeah
oh yeah
yeah
[laughter]
right
yeah
[laughter]
yeah yeah
yeah
[laughter] well i- i envy you [laughter]
life life track or
oh the blood pressure
yeah
yeah
wow
yeah
[laughter]
yeah
well they had that whole life track thing that i participated in at Spring Creek
and at the time i was a real mess i mean uh i was eating poorly i you know my cholesterol was everything was borderline my blood pressure was borderline my cholesterol was borderline but since then
uh and it had nothing to do with the life track thing but but just i think well maybe it did i you know i guess it makes you think
you know we've changed our eating habits dramatically i mean when uh when the phone rang uh we were making granola um
and uh uh we- we're trying to cut down on meat and you know we're doing all the all the stuff that the you know all the mags are talking about these days uh um
but you know i i feel a lot better about i- feel like you know i i don't uh uh you know i- it becomes a real worry uh but you know uh you never [vocalized-noise] these things are like time bombs and all of a sudden they go off and uh
and um i guess looking at my parents and seeing all the problems they've had you know my mother's had bypass surgery and uh and she's she's g-
okay so what kind of cars are you looking at
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
oh okay
uh-huh
right that's a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a um
[noise] a Pontiac uh believe six thousand
and he got a a demo and it's been a real good car and it's it's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it
and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually and so it's a i think it's a pretty good option
are the uh Oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos or they used are they new [laughter]
uh-huh
um-hum
and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uh-huh
[laughter] oh no
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
right that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because my last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that's in you know low mileage and in good shape
but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or is something wrong with it but i guess that's a risk you have to take
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
right
um-hum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know
yeah that's not bad
it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car [laughter] to find out yeah
yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don't want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and
and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i've got for a few years because it's it's it's almost four years old but it's still in great shape i have a Mazda RX7
um-hum
yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all
could you hold on for just a moment okay [noise]
[noise] okay i'm on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the channel up on it i didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record so [laughter] anyway
but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it's it's not having any mechanical problems whatso- in fact it never has and uh
it's been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all and um
i'll just hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now [laughter] and get that out of my system
because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too so [laughter] um
um-hum
wow
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
oh my gosh [laughter]
oh no [laughter]
um-hum yeah
right what kind of car is it
um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or
okay
uh-huh
um-hum
so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing
or maybe more than that as i've learned yeah when i bought my RX7 i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so
you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i- i think trading it in they they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in
that's what i think so
but strangely enough the best off- i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price
trade in but it's a place in Arlington and i think maybe [vocalized-noise] as you get outside the Dallas area i kind of i bet you it's kind of what i decided well maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better
prices plus i was going through the that TI fleet discount program
um well it's before they had that
i had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and and what you could expect they said you know a five percent
over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that
but i- i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the Town North Mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in Arlington
and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me
and i went the next morning to Arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at Town North so it was that same car
and i said like yeah well unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage [laughter] i got the car off your lot for that price [laughter]
oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh
that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he s- he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i- and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington
went and took the car because i told him there's a place in Arlington that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and the next day they
pulled the white car and took it to Arlington so i'm sure he knew [laughter] so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face
is kind of nice but
yeah good talking to you too Don
okay good luck in your car hunting uh-huh bye-bye
[noise]
well we've uh we've we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and a a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old
because uh
i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that's big enough for six
and so tha- we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around uh
[noise] we found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway
that uh
in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been uh a demonstrator model
for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you
for a new car
so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that
uh-huh
okay
yeah
uh-huh
sure
oh yeah
yeah i think so too
well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um-hum well now um
now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in
yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it'll probably be gone in a day and it's probably gone by now
those things go fast
um
of course we- we're not we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half
so then it becomes uh more realistic
uh-huh
yeah
that's right that's right
well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know y- y- if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two
you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it
and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting
oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars
no huh-uh
i- i would i would think so
isn't that a good feeling
that's right
well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it
yeah
oh yeah
um-hum
yeah i wou- i would think that's true
sure
right right that's fine
that's right that's right
well
yeah yeah
that's right that's right
eventually
yeah the first two cars i ever bought um well uh i've i've bought three cars and i've i've always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and i've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that
so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever
but uh
my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now
about about a quart every hundred miles
so uh but uh but i mean it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that's that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later
it's a a Buick Century
uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car
and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low
yeah um y- you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in
oh really
oh there you go
well that's fact
i think you're right
interesting
um-hum
the okay did y- did you use it [vocalized-noise] the car shop place
oh okay
that's right yeah
right right
yeah that's good
uh-huh
right
yeah yeah
is that right
my gosh
and y- and you laughed all the way to the bank
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's right
yeah
such a deal
i'll bet you did
well Dana it's been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you
[noise] okay you have a good evening
thank you much bye
[noise]
okay um i'm real happy with the car i have [laughter] i have a a Hyundai
and i bought it in uh eighty
no no no eighty eight or eighty seven eighty eight it's an eighty eight and uh i'm i've taken real good care of it and i'm real
happy with it but if my financial situation was different there's probably other cars i would like to have [laughter]
so
uh-huh
oh that a Ni- is that a Nissan i have a friend that has one that's just gorgeous yeah they not and then oh they do ride nice too in fact when
yeah when i i was si- i was sitting here waiting for for her to find somebody i was trying to think what kind would i and Nissan Maxima came into my mind
she has a real pretty one it's kind of a
oh it's not white and it's not beige it's kind of a cream color oh God it's pretty it's got a sun roof in it yeah it's a nice car but boy she must have paid a fortune for it
yeah
uh-huh
oh really
i probably do too i like the way my car rides though uh course i have a sun roof and i open it up so i hear i hear the wind [laughter]
and but it's comfortable to drive i i really don't have much problem with that i think it's comfortable i'm really sold on i you know
i i don't remember what i paid pretty close to ten thousand i think with everything all together it came to eleven with tax and everything you know but i'm i'm real pleased with it
yeah i bought it at Eagle
and i get great service there yeah
see i used to work at Lemmon Avenue so i that's right across the street from it
so i just walked across the street and bought a car so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because i'd just pull it in during the day you know i worked second shift at that time and i'd just leave my car you know
and let them work on it i'd bring it in and go to work and then pick it up i'd go out on break at five thirty and pick up my car it was you know real convenient now it's not so convenient
no not a thing
it's been
me neither and i've i've been really careful to take it when it needs service i do what the book says and i take it in i took you know for the valves
for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand and i change the oil every two to three thousand miles and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car
you know no matter what
yeah and i get good gas mileage and it's just been a great car it's i'm i'm real pleased with it i have no no qualms about and i wouldn't mind buying another one if i had to you know the
uh-huh
there's a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them i think a lot of people walked across the street but uh
uh there's a couple people that have gone a hundred thousand miles on theirs and it's still in good shape so and yet i know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves and that's about six seven hundred dollars but they didn't take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to
and you know and i do that i think if you take good care of your car you know i've got thirty a little over thirty two thousand miles on mine how much how many miles do you have on yours
do you have the oil changed a lot and everything
no see i don't have a husband so i have to have it done you know when i did have a husband he didn't like to do stuff like that but i didn't have this car but uh i don't know
i love it i love it
yeah i made i you know i gave up the automatic transmission when i test drove the car i i didn't like the automatic transmission because it didn't have any get up and go and i
i like to shift so i i got a five speed and the automatic transmission was three hundred dollars and so was the sun roof so i was kind of a trade [laughter] well i'll take the standard shift but i want the sun roof
so oh and i love that sun roof i use it all the time i really do
ooh [laughter]
where do you live
okay so you come down seventy five
ooh which where do you work which part
so you're in the which building
oh you're in the SC building
i'm in i'm over in payroll so we're we're in Park Central
yeah Park Central Five [vocalized-noise] you know just across i come to the SC dock every afternoon deliver checks and to go out on the on the trucks so
you know i'm just across the road but i live in Oak Cliff so i drive the toll road every day
and it's great you know there's never very much well there's traffic but it's never stop and go unless there's a wreck you know i would never drive Central Expressway
i go twenty miles one way
yeah
that's not too that's not too bad
[laughter]
yeah i'd [vocalized-noise] i like i wouldn't mind having a convertible
well i saw a pretty little convertible the other day on the toll road a red one oh gosh it was so cute no it was i don't oh what was it i think it was a Mustang
if i'm not mistaken i think i noticed it was a Mustang and it was new and it was pretty
so i also like the Rabbit uh convertibles i think they're kind of cute
i bet he does
they're expensive
uh oh my God
and i and i bet it's not comfortable is it comfortable
that's right
that's all that is
[laughter]
yeah i i hear the Volkswagen engine you know is really good well isn't it made by um
oh G- Mercedes
i used to have a Kharman Ghia red one at one time and i loved that car i i wish now i hadn't sold it
